<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has no proposals for and legislation to restrict <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech (3) in Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, docs the statement by the Assistant Ministerial Member mean, that there is a need for some restriction on <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, of speech in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700603_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-29-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition because this is the first time in 5 years that I have heard any protest coming from the Opposition about the repression of civil liberties and the right of people to live their lives in decency and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is well known that since the deposition of  Mr Dubcek  and the Svoboda Government and the restriction of powers by the more liberal elements there, and particularly since the advent of  Mr Gustav  Husak in more or less virtual control in that country there has been a denial of civil liberties and a denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister convey, through appropriate diplomatic channels, that the Australian people deplore any government interference with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press, radio or television? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy of the last few months is that governments such as the Australian Government, which express all the great <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighting slogans and so on about Vietnam, have not taken even the slightest piece of diplomatic initiative on Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> Ride’ was organised by the Association Against the National Service Act as part of its campaign for this young man’s release. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that I wish to put to the Attorney-General is this: In clause 14 of this Bill positive statements are made as far as certain rights, freedoms and dignities in respect of protected persons are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently protected persons in this country in turn are entitled to certain freedoms and dignities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly object to the proposition that apparently non-protected persons in this country are not entitled to those freedoms and dignities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is up to the Government to protect the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the general population to the same extent as it is prepared to protect these specially declared people under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessary to continue conscription which disrupts young men’s lives and restricts their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control of property - <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice will be allowed but with provision for consultation with the Council and/or the Administration as a safeguard against exploitation; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liquor Canteen System - <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to Reserve residents to decide whether or not liquor will be permitted on a particular reserve; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  always has a point when he speaks about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way the trade union movement uses its power against individuals to deny them <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is absolutely and completely deplorable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the duty of the Government - of any government - to ignore such people and to provide the defence forces necessary for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen reports that Jews wishing to leave the Soviet Union are being forced to pay for their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by being charged, on a sliding scale commensurate with their education, for their visas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, do the same reports place the price of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as high as 12,200 roubles, or approximately $20,000, for a university graduate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>87 - <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-45-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Terrorism Act of that country for alleged smuggling of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters into South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that until now patients or prospective patients of public hospitals in all States of the Commonwealth except Queensland have not had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of entry as public patients if their income exceeded a relatively low means test? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that until now pensioner patients have not had the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of attending the specialist of their choice but were forced to attend specialists as outpatients of public hospitals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there is the more important aspect of the religious persecution itself and the fact that the communist world not only is opposed to religion and is the enemy of religion but also, having developed under the precepts of Lenin which are followed very exactly, is engaged in a campaign of the most effective indirect suppression of religion while at the same time boasting of some kind of spurious <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any erosion of an individual’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor or hospital; and  (0  its effects on the national economy and the quality of health care for present and future generations of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister seek to amend the Act to extend to radio and television the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> enjoyed by the Press in this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this not mean that the Government’s claim of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for patients and support for private hospitals and private patients is not true? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed this evening that the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  flogged the old line that under our scheme people will not have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members I present an interdepartmental committee report entitled ‘Proposed <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Legislation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The private health funds must be seen in the context of Labor’s aim, which is to destroy non-government health insurance in this country and to destroy, therefore, patients’ <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice- the choice of funds, of doctors and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that honourable members in all parties in this House, as well as those in the other place, pay constant regard to the need to preserve the rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement as well as all the other privileges that ought to appertain to people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What first, second, third or fourth <span class="highlight">freedom</span> advantage did Australia gain through these negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-49-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all they cherish their freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cherish the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to go broke if they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cherish the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to go to the doctor of their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cherish the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make voluntary contributions if they so wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, there is considerable advantage to be gained, in my view, by allowing the Ombudsman to have this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement so that departments would be kept on their toes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That this House notes with pride and sadness the 20th anniversary of the heroic and patriotic uprising of the people of Hungary in October 1956 and recalls their famous last message: ‘ Here we must live, here we will die ‘ and the valour of those who laid down their lives in the cause of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and expresses the wish that one day the people of Hungary will have the opportunity to live in their country with the same rights and freedoms as those which are enjoyed by the people of the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this ban an infringement of the fundamental civil liberty of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to submit the petition for examination by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence with a request that it explore ways and means of obtaining from the Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics some advice as to the policy of his Government on the matters raised in the petition and also in regard to the reality of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religious worship and instruction for the Jewish and other religions in the U.S.S.R. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-1-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing sadder or more mischievous than the pretence that in some way they are greater fighters for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> than members of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen that the Commonwealth is working towards a better and more efficient Agreement; one whereby the States will have more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and initiative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government now reconsider its attitude towards the proposed zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality which has been proposed and supported by the littoral countries of the South East Asian and Indian Ocean areas, by the United Nations and at the last Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, but not by his Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is over 3000 years since Moses led the Jews to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from Pharaoh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Due largely to the approach made to members of the Parliament during the week by members of the Committee for the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Soviet Jewry, the House will be aware of the recent reintroduction of the ban by Soviet authorities on the import of flour products into that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This traditional Jewish festival of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is held in celebration of both the Hebrew exodus from enslavement in Egypt and the subsequent formation of the Jewish people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, bearing in mind the fundamental principles contained in section 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution, this House is of the opinion that it is alien to the concept of federalism if deliberate industrial strike action is instigated for the purpose of interfering, hindering or preventing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of trade and commerce between the States or for the purpose ofeffectively isolating one State from the other States and accordingly this House is of the opinion that in defence of the federal system in Australia legislation should be passed by this Parliament at the earliest opportunity to ensure thatthose who choose to contravene the principles of section 92. by isolating States and in particular the State of Tasmania, shall be called upon to publicly answer for their actions and shall be subject to appropriate sanctions in accordance with the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770503_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Toss  of life of the East Timorese people in support of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and in the support of our servicemen in the Second World War was enormous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been proved over the years that that institution which best provides that order along with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the citizen is the institution of Parliament, where decisions are made by a majority of those elected by a majority of the people of the country at regular intervals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proper foundation for government is a universal law of right and wrong self-evident to the intuitive commonsense of every man; that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is a power of personal self-direction which no man can delegate to another; that the purpose of society is not the protection of property but fulfilment of the needs of living human beings; that good citizens have the right and duty, not only to overthrow incurably oppresive governments, but before that point is reached to break particular oppressive laws; and that we owe our ultimate allegiance, not to this or that nation, but to the whole family of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Does his Government subscribe to a policy of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, or does it subscribe to a policy of guilt by association? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt in anybody’s mind that this Government does subscribe to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and to the rights of people and citizens to express their views even when they dissent from the Government or dissent from any other mode of authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no mention of Melbourne or Melbourne streets or any other particular locality, but whether one approved of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, and the answer I gave I will now have pleasure in repeating: That we do approve of that, that we do believe that ought to be supported by ali members of Parliament, and we equally believe that when the false claim is made that there is a right for people to associate to interfere with the rights of other citizens or to break the law then every member of Parliament ought to resist that, and these are the principles to which I gave an answer on a question of principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the problem confronting this Government - it should be a problem of all governments and all members of Parliament - is to balance the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual with the rights of the individual and the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The decision as to when that principle is involved requires the active consideration of all who are resolved to maintain a private enterprise economy; all who really believe in allowing individuals <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to live and work as they wish; all who strive to create a climate for the encouragement of initiative and resourcefulness, leading to productive efficiency, high output and a fair share of the nation’s wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is fundamental Liberal policy that some controls in Government administration are necessary to maintain greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for others - that is, the public interest - for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and not licence is the aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in private enterprise because of its respect for individual freedoms - <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice tempered by considerations of the public interest - for out of that in the long term will come the correct way to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can only hope that these great nations, representing - as they do  -  250 million people of the Asian region will be able to bring their influence to bear on other countries, particularly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in an attempt to make some contribution towards the defence of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and of independence in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That system, which this Government introduced in 1953 and then confirmed with the Reserve Bank Bill and the establishment of the Reserve Bank in 1957, has been a kind of economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which has meant that Australia would prosper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whenever or wherever a public or semi-public organisation or instrumentality is shown to be economically viable and making a profit the Government either hands it over to private enterprise for exploitation or, as in this particular instance, in order to protect the private consultants, it ensures bv way of legislation that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of competition will not be one of its attributes or a condition of its operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things T think it is necessary for a government to do in scrutinising the Broadcasting and Television Act is to keep before it all the time the necessity to be dynamic in its approach to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the producer to produce the kind of programme which is in the best interests of his own creative ability, of his audience and of the programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alan Reid, perhaps the most experienced and most balanced of all of our political correspondents, drew attention to this gravest of all threats to our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in an excellent article in the ‘Sunday Telegraph’ of 16th August last, when he gave the irrefutable facts concerning a direction to the building workers’ union to step up the destruction of private property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Too often discipline has become a dirty word and law, order and authority are despised, lt has been the breaking down of law and order, the loss of respect for leaders, for parents and for democratic institutions and the growth of the permissive society, of so-called sexual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, that have been the downfall of every great nation and every great empire in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could go on quoting items from the constitution and rules of the Australian Labor Party which are, in my opinion, all designed to destroy financial <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, incentive and ambition of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The constant attack in this House on Australian workers who, as I have said previously, are mostly ex-servicemen who fought for this country in world wars under Labor Governments for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of election which we now enjoy, is repugnant to me as it must be to the workers and citizens of Australia generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Above all else - and I say this to the young Fascist, the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  - Hitler destroyed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great ironies in political practice in this country is the way in which the Liberal Party proclaims itself as a party of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, of liberty and of standing for the rights and the dignity of man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In their participation in organisations which are the known creatures of international Communist front organisations, there has grown up a preparedness on the part of members of the Labor Party on the other side of this Parliament to create a climate which I believe is denying that basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of dissent which is essential if we in Australia are to continue to develop under the concept of the rule of law and the concept of maturity which I believe any thinking Australian would espouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well for honourable members opposite to refer to what happens in other countries where allegedly there is no form of censorship and say that those societies have not been harmed, but 1 will leave in the minds of honourable members these quotations and let them decide whether the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the United States - and I believe that in certain States there is almost complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> - perhaps has not stopped the depravity of which the honourable member for Maribyrnong spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The privilege of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from arrest or molestation of members of Parliament, which is of great antiquity, was of proved indispensability, first to the service of the Crown, and now to the functioning of each House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is stated by Blackstone and others, and has been the general opinion (founded, probably, upon the ancient law and custom, by which writs of summons for a Parliament were always issued at least forty days before its appointed meeting), that the privilege of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from arrest remains with a member of the House of Commons ‘for forty days after every prorogation, and forty days before the next appointed meeting’; and this extent of privilege has been allowed by the courts of law, on the ground of usage and universal opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the honourable member for Lalor established, as he claims, the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement in the office, or is this the usual grandstanding of the honourable member for Lalor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has certainly not achieved <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement in the office and if anything can be said at this time it is that what the honourable member for Lalor has achieved is to structure in this country a threat to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement in the office by his delibertae confrontation with civil authority and with duly constituted law and order as determined by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former AttorneyGeneral went on to say: The Government has decided that it should undertake the task of balancing the various interests, of making an effort to achieve a synthesis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order, as the objective has been described, in a suitable modern statute covering, but expressly limited to, matters within the area of Commonwealth legislative responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Broadly expressed, the special duty imposed by international law on a state that receives a diplomatic or special mission, or consents to the establishment of a consular post, is to take appropriate steps to protect the premises of the mission or post against intrusion or damage, to prevent any attack on the person, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or dignity of the personnel of the mission or post and to prevent disturbance of the peace, or impairment of the dignity, of the mission or post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of this I do not dispute, but nevertheless I must protest that there are times when <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is not helped by obeying the law, when the most vital freedoms have to be defended by defying the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Heckling at a political meeting, which is a long established Australian expression of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, could well cause the repressive measures of this Bill to be enforced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710420_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What in fact distinguishes a democratic society is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and tolerance that the society gives to individuals and groups to think as they see fit, to feel as they choose, to express their views as individuals, to organise together as groups in assemblies, to express their views in order to publicise those views and to change government thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Minister put the crux of the legislation in the following terms: ‘Of making an effort to achieve a synthesis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that if we are to have a free society then women are entitled to have their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> whether they are married or single. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I notice, for instance, that donations to the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> from Hunger campaign, the Save the Children Fund and the Volunteer Services Abroad fund, all worthwhile causes, attract deductions from taxation in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this certainly does not extend to the question of compulsory unionism and, as I have mentioned in response to what the honourable gentleman has questioned, the Government is opposed to compulsory unionism because it does cut across individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But we talk in terms of the ability or the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to follow their own dictates of conscience or inclination in the matter of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we give fairly free rein to conscience in other respects, not least in the c?se of dissenters from national service and others, whether or not we prefer a secular basis for education, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose the educational institution to which we might send our children seems to me to be a pretty fundamental one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This private investment in education is, I believe, extremely important and should be encouraged as it not only preserves the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the individual but also encourages educational experimentation and the provision of increased total resources for education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great things in this country, I believe, is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion and a parent therefore has the right to give his child a basic moral and religious education if he so chooses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, we would give genuine <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion accepted by all, it would be expected that religious instruction would be provided for non-Catholics by their coreligionists in the schools while the Catholic students are getting their religious instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Education should promote love of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and justice and should develop critical perception, ability to choose intelligently, capacity for selfgovernment and a sense of social responsibility, lt should instil belief in the equal rights of all people and respect for their essential humanity, irrespective of nationality, colour or creed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that if the church has difficulty - and I am quite concerned that people should have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to give their children the education which they want to give them - one of the solutions may well be that those Catholics who are part of the State school teaching staff should be free to teach in church schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one accepts the premise that individual liberty is something valuable in itself or valuable because it is essential to fulfilment of human  potentialities  legal coercion in any form must be regarded as  prima lacie  objectionable, an interference with individual liberty which cannot be tolerated unless it is shown to be indispensable to the securing of some countervailing good.1 But what benefit or good should a liberty-minded society endorse as sufficient to warrant the inhibition of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which legal coercion always involves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720302_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the finest flower of chivalry, the honourable member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley),  spoke about SEATO acting to protect the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Thailand and the Philippines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In neither of those countries is there much <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was talking about the diversity in the Liberal Party - and it is what is missing in the Opposition because its members have no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to stand up in this or any other place and disagree with its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to say that he has that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> we have and it is precisely the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that members of the Labor Party do not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720321_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also provides for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of payments from Australian or territory taxation or restrictions imposed by Australian or territory law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I referred to a trained teaching profession with a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement around Australia or into the neighbouring islands of the Pacific, according to their own choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are proposing in relation to this Bill is dignity for the teaching profession, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of trained teachers into various educational authorities without direction, great flexibility for this body to be used in the Pacific generally than is provided for in the legislation, greater flexibility for these teachers to be used within the States, higher professional standards by developing and utilising educational faculties in universities, the participation of teachers in the government of this scheme, and the participation of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an inhibition of professional <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to engage in public educational debate is contrary to the spirit of any profession and an obvious example of the Public Service approach to the establishment of a Commonwealth Teaching Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also took up with  Mr Heath, Mr Barber  and their Minister representing the United Kingdom at the Council of Ministers of the European Community the point that when Britain went into the Community it should be outward looking and consequently that it should ensure the greatest <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of multilateral! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be known that it is a cardinal principle of the Liberal and the Country Parties that we believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of worship and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of belief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Navy and the Air Force are concerned with the preservation of the security of our general maritime environment and with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of navigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That motive was to give the people of South Vietnam a chance to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those countries were all fighting desperately to maintain their own individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and to have their own national aspirations, but every one of them without exception was infiltrated by communist aggression within, and somebody had to do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We gave an opportunity to South Vietnam to establish its own <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has all happened because we contributed our small part to allow this small nation to preserve its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In effect what he said was that if the honourable member for Sturt is to accuse people in this place of not standing for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech or of exercising coercion he should look at his own house first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Prime Minister assure the House that it is the intention of this Government to maintain in Australia a society where individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is not submerged beneath the impersonal weight of socialisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In theory we should be able to rely on the United Nations to ensure this stability and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from external attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said on so many occasions, we need the support of our great friends and allies and I believe that the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, along with the other Commonwealth countries, will always believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720411_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-33-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, so if people in Washington, New York, London or Manchester want to travel direct to Melbourne, who are we to say that they should not do so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am raising the point that I do not know whether the inclusion or exclusion of such a provision makes any difference one way or the other, because it is in fact the majority of the House that makes the decision, and we have all accepted it as a tradition that when a Minister says yea or nay all of the loyal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters on his side of the House will stand up and be counted according to his yea or nay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth remembering that no country which has ever been firmly under communist rule has emerged from that communist rate into <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and the 800,000 refugees from North Vietnam who fled to South Vietnam rather than suffer under communist rule are a clear indication of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, South Korea had the right of independence and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from Communism and we were right to go to her assistance and help her to remain free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I am asking honourable members to strike a blow for their own personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, show their common sense and exercise their free vote in this instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are not actions which can be viewed with complacency by anyone who values peace and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could see that each and every one of these nations had realised that here was another small nation which was likely to be knocked off, to lose its <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, by the might of aggression about which the honourable member for Wills talks on the one hand but on the other can give no solution as to how it is to be prevented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although some honourable members might not agree with what I am saying, I believe that on that day we should pay tribute to the men and women of our fighting forces to whom we owe our <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 wish to raise during the debate on the motion that the House do now adjourn the problem of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is, for example, a United States <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act which should, I suggest, be adopted in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With whom do Kevin Cairns’ loyalties lie - Peace with <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> or the Government; the DLP or the Liberal Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for parliamentary approval of the guarantee agreement, ft makes consequential provision to ensure the effectiveness of undertakings in the loan and guarantee agreements regarding <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of payments from Australian taxation or restrictions imposed by Australian law and includes an appropriation of moneys required for the Commonwealth to make any payments under the guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assuming that we accept the Minister’s avowal of innocence in any plot to weaken the Government and strengthen the DLP, surely he must reconsider his association with the Peace with <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> group in the light of  Mr Samuel’s  remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fairness to the honourable member for La Trobe, I want to make it clear that he is not really opposed to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, although one would not get that impression from listening to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is just opposed to one’s right to use that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720427_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, this Government’s philosophy rates very highly the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals to decide for themselves, within the broad framework of our democratic society, matters concerning their own wellbeing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly it is .not recognised as a role of this Government to impose prohibitions on people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice except for the most compelling national reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister reaffirm the Australian Government’s belief in the value of the ANZUS Treaty to the defence of Australia and will he reassure the Australian people that the Government will give all moral support to President Nixon in his efforts to bring a peace to Vietnam which will ensure the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the South Vietnamese people to choose their own form of government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a country is attacked, as Cambodia has been, we can endeavour to assist it to maintain its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and its own form of government at its invitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But one has to bear in mind when one looks at these slogans, these expressions introduced by this kind of government, such as ‘increased democracy and ‘more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to appeal’, a very real social purpose is being chased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, in the early part of the nineteenth century, prevalent social doctrine favoured a minimum of government interference in economic relations and a maximum of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to contract and no Government controls will be imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, the private sector can have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of contract, complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of negotiation, complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of fixation of either prices or profits and, in fact, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from any restrictions, inhibitions and constrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So are we all concerned with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, but <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the consumer, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the man who is to buy a packet of cigarettes if he wants to, or the man who buys a motor car, a loaf of bread, a bar of chocolate, a Shirt or a suit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, which proclaims time and again that it believes in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and that it believes in free speech, is at the moment, in my view, treading a very dangerous path if it pursues its present course, mapped out for it by the Minister for the Navy  (Dr Mackay)  in his now famous guideline statement in this House some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should make this point clear: The Commonwealth Government’s attitude is that States should be able to have so much <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action as they can exercise which is consistent with their taking action to raise revenues for the purposes of expenditures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, in this respect that section of the ordinance represents a curtailment of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation does not restrict the traditional rights, such as the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and assembly; nor should it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that the series of governments we have had under  Sir Robert  Menzies,  Mr Gorton  and  Mr McMahon  - I leave out one Prime Minister - have favoured making some aspects of political <span class="highlight">freedom</span> into crimes and, on the contrary, have proved sympathetic to certain criminal conduct provided that those who carry it out are anticommunist and are supported or believed they will be supported by Democratic Labor Party type and National Civic Council type leaders and supporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Put in another way, it can be said that Australia needs a bill of rights so that we can enlarge and extend existing areas of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, the primary civil liberties in the American constitutional context are <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of petition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other civil liberties in the United States of America which are guaranteed by other constitutional amendments - for example, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from unreasonable searches and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from seizures that are protected by the American Fourth Amendment, and the right not to testify against oneself that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to do everything else must take cognisance of the rights of the innocent people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We did not create them but we inherited them, and these are the things that protect the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we attempt to reduce an idea as subtle and as complex as the idea of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech into a few lines in a statute, we in practice find that we are subjected to the interpretation placed on that by a court and a judge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, under the American guarantee of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech the person who relies on that constitutional guarantee might not be the one whom it was intended to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that broadly speaking, arguments as to whether people should be able to defy a particular piece of legislation should be covered by the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, especially as the person concerned did not give any leaflets to a person who was covered by that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the way through the Minister’s speech, there is some vague suggestion that what the Government upholds by its flat rate grants is a principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that the honourable member for Fremantle and his colleagues would deny them that incentive, initiative and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action does not at all impress us on this side of the House, although I would agree that there remains a part of the argument which deserves attention; that is to say that other people should not be disadvantaged, should not be unable to have access to education of some reasonable kind through lack of income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the basic freedoms which we in the Liberal and Country Parties have always believed in is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to have the education of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is at stake when one considers the approach of the Australian Labor Party to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that in all these areas concerned with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals to choose in the basic traditions of the Australian way of life and in a contemporary philosophy of education, the Australian Labor Party is sadly old fashioned and out of phase with today’s thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They range from what used to be, at least until tonight, the approach of the honourable member for Fremantle which we have all admired, which was a deep concern with and belief in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in education, to the approach of those honourable members opposite who would nationalise, centralise and secularise all Australian education if the Australian people would only let them do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And the patients too; that the sort of socialistic approach which the Labor Party proposes on health and which is inherent in its scheme would be absolutely disastrous and would lead in particular to a shortage of the provision cf health services in Australia and, above all and most importantly, would lead to a substantial decline in the quality of health services provided, in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The existing scheme offers to the individual a high standard of medical and hospital service, together with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor, hospital and benefits fund, at a moderate residual cost to the patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative Labor Party compulsory scheme - a giant stride towards fully nationalised medicine - eliminates <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of benefits fund, provides only for public ward coverage, aims to destroy private nursing homes and private and independent hospitals, and, as the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury)  just implied, it will cost the majority of people substantially more for a less effective service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The flow of such people will be most beneficial, as their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from prior contracts will allow us a much wider field of selection particularly of skilled tradesmen and workers of types which are needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Labor Party say that if an Australian company wants to build something that is for the ultimate benefit of the nation and the Australian consumer; if it can buy a better product overseas and pay the duty on it; if it can buy overseas a product that is safer than the Australian product; if it can buy the product overseas more cheaply even after paying the duty levied by this Parliament; and if it can get it in half the time or a quarter of the time, the company cannot have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and buy the product overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most far-reaching may well be the growing public interest in environmental quality, which may lead to the rejection of the motor car as the universal symbol of individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the adoption of less time-wasting relationships between home and work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720928_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The scheme of the legislation goes on to provide the machinery for examining these agreements with a view to achieving the result that is sought, which is that sought by the whole operation of the Restrictive Trades Practices Act, namely, an increasing competition and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in trade and commerce and, generally, a healthier climate for business activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721024_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The way in which the Australian* Labor Party attacks doctors is vicious, unfortunate and in extremely poor taste, but not as callous and unfortunate as the Labor Party’s disregard for the freedoms and rights of patients in its obsession with controls and commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721025_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essential, therefore, that the benefit-cost study has sufficient <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to produce ultimately a selection of the best site having regard, on the one hand, to the community’s need for efficient air transport services, and on the other, to its desire to avoid unnecessary economic or environmental penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, it is interesting to look at the brief on this subject and to find that the cost of home brewed beer is 7c a bottle and that the Opposition’s sturdy <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters for the workers seem to be defending the right of the worker not to have home brew at 7c but to buy commercial beer for 42c a bottle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This truth was well enunciated in the Vatican 2 Declaration of Religious <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> where it was stated that truth cannot impose itself except by virtue of its own truth; that is, one can seek to impose truth, not by the force of the law and the power of the state, but rather by the force of its own influence on the mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are quite rightly directed towards such things as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, safety, hours of work, conditions of work and things of this character because the members of that Organisation desire, one against the other, to be protected against the consequences of sweated labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is true to say that for very many years it was believed that it was the responsibility of the Government to reduce or to eliminate <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from fear and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from want and that consequently the pensioner should be entitled to have confidence in the fact that he would in moments of anguish and trial be assured of a base pension that would cover, first of all, the basic necessities and later on the conventional necessities such as housing, food and clothing, health and welfare services and similar types of necessities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, making improvements consistent with both our increased wealth and the changes in productivity - we should ensure that pensioners and superannuation recipients are able to share in the improved economic conditions and are able to feel that the Government wants to abolish <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from need, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from fear and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should also be clear now to most people who have studied the detail of the new technical developments in wool marketing that we are on the threshold of selling wool by description alone, which will give us more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in regard to the handling and transport of wool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the occasion of that meeting, I, together with other Ministers, particularly the Minister from South Australia, argued strongly for a relaxation of the quota system which operates in its present form against the production of a very valuable food which is in demand by Australians who want to buy it and who want to exercise their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In security matters our closest relationship is with the United States of America, but that does not rule out participating in the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations, honouring our obligations to our partners in the Five-Power Arrangements, including Malaysia and Singapore, encouraging the development of Association of South East Asian nations and the concept of a zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality in South East Asia and engaging in defence co-operation with other countries in our region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any responsible government concerned to prevent inflation must make a real and genuine attempt to limit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of entrepreneurs to fix prices as they please, to prevent land prices being forced up by land speculators and to take positive steps to stop the spiralling cost of housing - and that is exactly what this Government intends to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These kinds of unpleasant curbs may be necessary in the climate which the Government, through its mismanagement, has created; but we do not want to keep them on for longer than is necessary because they inhibit sound growth, they inhibit the progress of the economy and they represent an incursion into people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and the quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I feel that the element of deceit is where the honourable member interpreted the statement giving the Committee complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as an instruction that it was to reduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will maintain an atmosphere of confidence, but what of the attitude of parents who want the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to send their children to independent schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is a strange committee - the Karmel Committee - that says that it believes that there should be maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, that the price of choice should be reduced ..nd then, in its recommendations, adds to the price of choice to a degree that many parents must realistically consider whether they can justifiably exercise that choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister talked about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice but he does not say <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of what. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of a doctor; it is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to whether a man will send his child or wife to a public or private hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was an intolerable intrusion into and denial of that person’s personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the guise of concern for individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in general, the honourable member is in fact supporting the few - those few who have exploited the ordinary Australian whose only wish is to own his own block of land and to build his own house on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government not only supports, but wishes to promote, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals to choose and to be able to purchase their own home on their own block of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government and the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  in this vital area, continue to attempt to force on Australians a scheme which will result in a poorer medical service and at the same time restrict  -  I use the word restrict deliberately - the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor and hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> or the right to work has never come cheaply in any area but these matters are the same as in an industrial situation where the processes of conciliation and arbitration operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government takes higher and higher proportions of personal incomes so people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose how they will spend their money is progressively reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Scullin, an adjoining suburb, a similar community health centre is operating on a different basis, using doctors on a fee for service type system to give an alternative and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to the people of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister talks falsely about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He does not go on to say <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of what. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should talk about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice not of one’s own doctor but of whether one has hospitalisation in a public hospital or a private hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It enables these people to live their lives as a part of the community with the maximum of independence, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and comfort possible in old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the mandatory provision does not restrict the Government’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make changes of policy such as the recent 25 per cent reduction in tariffs, to negotiate changes in levels of assistance of the purpose of international trade agreements, or to extend preferential treatment to developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to improve the chances of success of migrant children - and native Australians - we must compensate for the backgrounds that are deficient - in books, magazines and communications media on the one hand and, on the other hand, lack of proper study facilities, such as warmth, privacy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from noise and interruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister to outline the attitude of the Government to the granting of entry into Australia to people who are or are not considered to be terrorists, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters or whatever other expression one likes to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere fact that a person happens to be - in the Government’s view anyway - a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighter does not necessarily mean that he is undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are certain basic rules of democracy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which state that there should be equality under the law but it is often overlooked that to obtain equality under the law we also need equality of access to h law if we are to protect those freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to our policies for open government and to open up the processes of government so that citizens may know what is going on and criticise the actions of government - it is not always easy and pleasant to be criticised; we all know that - there is a proposal for a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill which, I understand, the Attorney-General hopes to introduce in the course of this session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the worst features of the new policy is that it eliminates the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice  by  the lessee of a builder, as he must negotiate with the builder who has been allocated the site in which he is interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal features of the new system are not really the ones that the honourable member for Gwydir described - the paper work and the lack of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this new system people have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and they recognise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody likes queues, least of all me; but they queued up because the new system was too good to miss, because there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the statement made on Tuesday that the Government will recognise the new Government of Chile today, and with the understanding that governments may be recognised notwithstanding the manner in which they take government, how does the Minister reconcile this particular decision with the views stated in a telegram to the Chilean Ambassador in Australia on 13 September by eight of his Ministers and 36 other Labor members of Parliament and senators that the new government was illegal and that they would undertake efforts ‘to help the Chilean people regain their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not preserve, as I have indicated, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all we know, the people appointed to the Commission under this Minister could well be people who are committed o one form of education - government education - alone, whilst the Opposition is committed to a high standard of government education and, in addition, to the continued maintenance and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 26 calls upon member governments to preserve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in education and reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides no guarantees and no formal structures of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the educational processes of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They seek guarantees of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, effectiveness and decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point I want to make concerns the vital matter about which the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  spoke - the preservation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for parents and school children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point that I want to make is this: In our attempts in the amendments to ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and effectiveness and decentralisation we are aiming at the guaranteed participation of those deeply involved in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned already in this debate the basic adherence by the Liberal Party to the concepts of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no mention of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said I believe that we should do what we can to maintain an independent school system so that this very necessary aspect of the individual rights of people in Australia - that is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in the education of their children - should be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to be set out in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must support the amendments proposed by the Opposition which aim to protect the future <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of parents and students and to ensure that our education system continues with as great a degree of diversity, with a wide base, and taking in every area of this nation’s requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of individuals and students is a basic right in our democratic society, as is the basic right of all children to equal opportunity and equality of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way we of the Opposition believe that under this legislation a Commission can be established which will far more effectively carry out the philosophy enunciated by the Karmel Committee and at the same time raise the standard of education of every Australian child whilst preserving a right which Australians hold dear - the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, the right to select the schools to which they send their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the States’ obligation to compel a monopolistic situation where <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is taken away, either directly by prohibition or indirectly by so raising the price of choice that there is no choice at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt they are waiting for Pat Hills to become Premier before saying that the State legislation does not give <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice at the secondary level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, for us, it is fortunate that we live in a community which cherishes its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action, a country peopled by men and women who want to do their own thing in their own way and in their own time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants a degree of certainty and predictability in political life within which the greatest personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> can be freely exercised and a society in which they can make their own economic, financial and social decisions freed from the smothering concept that ‘mother knows best’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stands for free enterprise, but where is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> if we do not have the power to invest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schools were not visited by the Committee, and the way in which many schools were categorised caused confusion, resentment and uncertainty, and cut across the basic principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to the education of all children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental point at issue here ls not whether we can or cannot stomach the thought of this or that type of sexual behaviour; it is whether or not we believe that true morality and the best way of culivating personal responsibility is to be found through <span class="highlight">freedom</span>  ot  through compulsion, and whether or not we believe that the present law on this subject does more harm than good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the early 1940s, proposals were submitted to the Australian Agricultural Council which, as honourable members know, is a ministerial body, for the establishment of an institute of agricultural economics, with wider functions and powers than the present Bureau of Agricultural Economics, and wim complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> independently to carry out and publish the results of research into a whole range of matters affecting primary industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the mandatory provision does not restrict the Government’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make changes of policy such as the recent 25 per cent reduction in tariffs, to negotiate changes in levels of assistance for the purpose of international trade agreements, or to extend preferential treatment to developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we had the most extraordinary situation of eight of the Prime Minister’s Cabinet Ministers and 36 other members of the Labor Caucus sending a telegram to the Chilean Ambassador in Australia referring to the new Chilean Government as illegal and indicating that they would undertake to help the Chilean people to regain their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States already are tied to maintaining a specific proportion of their expenditures on education and if, at the same time, their general purpose allocations are to be reduced in this manner they will finish up in a position where they will have practically no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement at all in meeting their other expenditure responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do so because this system is most conducive to the progress and well-being of Australia and most conducive to the democratic protection of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to any erosion of an individual’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of a doctor or hospital, our scheme has always been based on the concept of complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, essentially on the private practice of medicine in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It takes away the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and in spite of the Minister’s constant reiteration of his support for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice let me stress to the House that the Minister does not believe in the form of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice that those words usually connote in the minds of the average Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the vital question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, which relates primarily to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to establish relationships in this policy area - relationships between patient and doctor, patient and the hospital - the Minister for Social Security, though he mouths the phrase <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice’, nevertheless has in his mind a totally different concept from that held by the majority of his listeners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If on seeing a private doctor it is found that the patient has a disease which requires admission to the public hospital, that person has no more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, other than if that person’s personal doctor is on the staff of that hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The platform of the Australian Labor Party, on the basis of which this Government attained office, made clear that Labor’s industrial policy places human rights and values first and provides for the development of full human dignity in the industrial sphere, lt emphasises the right of full employment; real economic justice; <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and security; the right to work in just and favourable conditions; <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from unemployment and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that this unduly hampers the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the State educational authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It therefore increases rather than diminishes inequalities and increases rather than diminishes <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that the previous Government’s policy, and the previous Government’s attitude of co-operation with the industry, stimulated by a real concern for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the security of the people of Australia, did much to achieve this self reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition wishes not only to ensure that this money goes to education but also to see retained the principle that every Australian child is entitled to go and his parents have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to send him to whatever school is selected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the principle of facilitating the settlement of migrants in Australia as expres sed in the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill, but we must remain conscious of the fact that people must retain their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to live wherever they want and to have the mobility to move from one place to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is important that in all of these policies we should ensure that the maximum amount of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is left in the hands of the individual citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation the Government is now proposing represents a sincere endeavour to build a new health benefits system in a way which will meet the expectations of the public for high quality health services to be readily accessible to all, which will expand rather than inhibit the opportunities for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, which will promote efficiency in the delivery of health services and which will assist in the upgrading of hospital and community based health facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This determination, however, has not been characterised by doctrinaire or rigid viewpoints which might exclude <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within the health insurance program, there will be complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of patients to choose their own doctors in private practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ninthly, price control entails a substantial interference with individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and its long-term effects would radically alter the structure of Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It carried with it obvious losses in efficiency, loss of individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and substantial direct costs, as well as delaying action to deal with the cause of the inflationary problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We challenge the Government, in this debate, to demonstrate its overall program to deal with inflation; how powers over prices and incomes would be incorporated into that program; that prices and incomes powers would have only a temporary role within that program; that discrimination against particular groups in the community and action against individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice are not its intention; and to state that it will take a responsible lead by reducing the extravagant growth in public sector spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The things which they consider political crimes are things which we in Australia would consider to be the very merest and proper expression of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has legislation been drafted to give effect to the Government’s pre-election pledge to introduce a <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-54-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to (4) The Interdepartmental Committee on <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Legislation which the Government established last January (Hansard, 24 October 1973, page 2665), is continuing its work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-54-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to deny the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of consumer choice by saying that if consumer choice is developed through promotion and marketing of a particular type of product - say for orange juice as distinct from milk - the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  has the power to prevent this natural consumer choice from having effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, Australia’s noisiest boast has always been our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My amendment continues:  and that therefore this Bill and associated Bills should be withdrawn, because the Government’s alternative proposals to the existing health scheme will (a) lower the quality of medical care for Australian families, (b) increase total costs for the Government and thus for taxpayers, (c) increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers, because they could only maintain the present quality of their health care by additional heavy commitments for private insurance, (d) reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, (e) jeopardize the future of religious, private and country hospitals and (f) by design and intent be the first stage of nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the fourth point that I made earlier, that is, reduced <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned that the Government, in its Bill, reduces <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of a doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme reduces or eliminates <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in the choice of an insurance fund up to standard ward level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point made related to the apparent loss of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, and we were assured that under our scheme patients will not have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of their doctor if they are admitted to the standard ward of a hospital, such as the Mercy Hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Br CASS  -  The honourable member can say ‘Oh’ but the reality once again is that when a person goes to the casualty department of a large public hospital today - where I concede there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice - he is treated by the doctor on duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have the same limitations on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the present scheme as you will have under our proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there is no such thing as complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice anywhere in Australia now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the availability of doctors, particularly in the hospital area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the White Paper lip service is paid to the ideal of continuing patient care or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in paragraphs 4.19 and 4.22 by the implication that patients will be able to have continuity of attendance by their own doctor, that is, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the last sentence of paragraph 4.22 shows that patients will have no guarantee whatsoever of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice because the final decision on which doctor can practice in a hospital and what he does in that hospital rests with the hospital authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will talk now of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in more detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to choose the type of hospital care they want and their right to the ready availability of medical services are fundamental principles of Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From reading this and other sections of the White Paper it would seem that the only <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice with respect to hospital treatment is a choice between treatment as a public ward patient or as a private ward patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not worth destroying and replacing it with a theoretical scheme which will be of far greater cost to us all, reduce our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and put us all under the medical control of a socialist government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The services so maintained should ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, social equity and cost efficiency, whilst primarily retaining and enhancing the quality of health care so provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, it will reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s scheme would, in fact, remove the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the 92 per cent of Australians who are insured, of their own volition, and compel them by the tax mechanism to insure with the Government fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties believe in the concept of maximum cover, but we cannot support a scheme which destroys the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of 92 per cent of Australians to achieve an additional coverage of less than 4 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence available simply demonstrates that it is impossible for a government department to provide a cheaper and more efficient service than a private insurance firm, lt must be remembered that with a unitary system such as is proposed by the Government there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as now exists between funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worst of all, of course, health insurance would be largely socialised, and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice would be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard much talk in this debate about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice do we have now? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme, as modified in the White Paper, does guarantee <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of private practice to the medical profession (though it seeks to devise in co-operation with the Australian medical profession a formula that would guarantee observance of scheduled fees by doctors) and it leaves the patient full <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to be treated by the doctor of his choice even in the public wards of hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us put aside the fanciful claims made by the Australian Medical Association and the General Practitioners Association about the so-called <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to select a doctor that supposedly exists today and let us look at the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, when the Australian Labor Government seeks to introduce a health care system which is based on the capacity of the income earner to pay and which will bring complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of fear from illness and improved quality of . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time every Queenslander has the right to exercise <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to doctor, hospital and voluntary health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To summarise, it will cost the individual in Queensland more, he will not have his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, and he can look forward to long watts for consultations, surgery and hospitalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Labor proposals people will be denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor in a public hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medical care should be based on complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the patient in all matters pertaining to and at all levels of medical, hospital, and paramedical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is trying to hoodwink the Australian people into a policy of help that completely denies <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to choose the type of hospital care they want and their right to the ready availability of medical services are fundamental principles of Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This role is especially important because such hospitals provide an opportunity for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice by patients and for the expression of high vocational motivations by those who work in and for them- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the Government trying to throw out a health scheme which the overwhelming majority of them have found perfectly satisfactory, which has given them good quality health care at reasonable cost, with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor, hospital and health insurance fund, and with speed and compassion, and in which they have genuine confidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always been concerned with the defence of individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> but the right to choose between the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia and the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia is the most insignificant <span class="highlight">freedom</span> I have ever heard of and the honourable member’s preparedness to fight for it must be the most ludicrous campaign since Don Quixote tilted at windmills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It claims to be lighting for such principles as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and quality of care, but both these principles are incorporated, and indeed extended, in the Government’s program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very first passage in this advertisement about which the honourable member for Darling Downs is apparently so happy states: ‘Would you trust either of these or any other politician to control your private life, to control your <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, to decide what you want to do, or to be, or to be paid?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was never any suggestion by the Prime Minister of this country that the Government would want to control the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people or to make decisions about what people want to do or be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some of the private beds in private hospitals are converted to public beds, as they will have to be to meet the increased demand, fewer private beds will be available, thus reducing the patient’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor because there is no choice of doctor in public wards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present people have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of funds and if they are dissatisfied with one fund they have the right to transfer to another without loss of privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member raises the hoary argument about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, and also asks why the Government does not cover the remaining members of the population by subsidising their membership of private insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, what sensible person would value the choice of being able to join the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia or the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia, paying the same rates of contribution and receiving the same benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support his concept that a high-quality health service should be readily available to all and that Australia’s health scheme should expand, rather than inhibit, the opportunities for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Minister told me that there would be the same <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor, even in hospitals, as there is now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice we hear so much about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot support proposals for a scheme which would reduce the quality of health care, and which would - despite the Minister’s denials - take away the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which we believe the Australian people are entitled to enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reduces professional standards, individual initiative and personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to the lowest common denominator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In place of the characteristic Australian philosophy which encourages innovation, initiative and personal choice, the Government by this scheme, seeks to impose a lumbering, bureaucratic monopoly that will stifle all those freedoms that Australians value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of what I wish to say tonight comes from a publication called ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> at Issue’ which is published by <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> House in New York. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of my remarks I shall give honourable members some details justifying this statement and explaining how a decision was made as to what was the status of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and what the political and civil rights were like in a particular country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> House is a non-party political organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked the honourable member for Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  for permission to include in Hansard a table titled ‘The Comparative Survey of <span class="highlight">Freedom</span>: Table of Nations’ and I now ask for leave of the House to incorporate this table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to point out to people who may criticise this organisation as being a right wing  organisaton,  because it certainly puts many of the countries under communist control very low in the scores, that this table which I have just incorporated in Hansard was drawn up in August 1973 at a time when Chile was still controlled by the Allende Government, yet Chile received an almost perfect score in relation to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Civil rights are the rights of the individual against the state, rights to free expression, to a fair trial; they are what most of us mean by <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each nation or dependency in the world, these are: (1) comparison of civil liberties, (2) comparison of political liberties, X3) the balancing of these to establish the relative status of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and (4) establishing current trends in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, whether there has been no recent change or whether a change is positive or negative as it relates to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to civil rights, we are interested first of all in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also seems reasonable to consider <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from harsh and unusual punishments and torture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also means that there is a variety of news media and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression is both possible and evident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, criticism is often allowed to appear in limited ways, and a few favoured individuals are allowed considerable <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to encourage those who are interested in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> all over the world to have a look at the table which has been incorporated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quite depressing to me when I was attending the United Nations to find that so many of the resolutions coming forward criticising other countries for an alleged lack of democracy and of political freedoms were often sponsored by countries which almost never exceeded the six or seven ranking, which represents the bottom of the possibilities for both political and civil rights, and that countries where the people obviously have no political or civil rights were continuously ranting about alleged interference with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in other countries that admittedly also had relatively poor rankings but which certainly were no worse off than the people who were criticising them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will tell the people that whilst we are nationalistic we preciously guard our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of government, our federal system of government, with State governments exercising specific areas of responsibility and acting, if necessary, as a check against the intrusion and the excesses of central government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people do genuinely appear to have been deceived into thinking that they will lose their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of operation of private insurance, in areas where it was suggested in the Green Paper it should be restricted, was to be allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not attempted to deal constructively with the health care problems facing this nation but it is trying to force the people of Australia into a corner so that private hospitals, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the things that we have come to expect as being essential to a democratic society will end in domination by Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once this centralism is achieved we will find that the grants of money will have a whole series of conditions attached to them which will deprive local government of its own <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and some bureaucrat in Canberra will decide the way in which local government ought to conduct its affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arising out of the Attorney-General’s inquiries into the closure of the ‘Independent Sun’, Perth, will the Attorney-General examine the controls and restrictions on news services within Australia, particularly those concerning membership of Australian Associated Press and the availability of the Associations’ service, with a view to ensuring that these conditions in no way restrict <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will use whatever means we can to redress any errors that we believe you have made in the interests of maintaining the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action of the members on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740709_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it would lower the quality of medical care for Australian families; it would increase total costs for the Government and thus for all taxpayers; it would increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers, because they could only maintain the present quality of their health care by additional heavy commitments for private insurance after having paid the 1.35 per cent super tax; it would reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and it would jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Part of that annual report covers the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> Fund which was set up to defend private medical practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> Fund financial statement for the period ended 31 December 1973  -  that is for one year - shows an expenditure of $431,211 to fight the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What a wonderful result for all the disruption, reduction in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and decline in standards of health care that will occur under Labor’s health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has given them good quality health care at reasonable cost, with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, of doctor, of hospital and health insurance fund, with speed and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills will destroy the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor by the individual patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have instead a universal health insurance scheme which covers everyone in the community, a scheme which gives some meaning to the loose talk of freedoms, we hear from honourable members on the other side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this scheme there will be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for all, including those among that minority of 13 per cent of the community who do not have health insurance cover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why the contract should not be of detriment is hard to understand because if the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to contract is to be retained subject to the public interest then if there is no detriment to the public surely the contract should remain on foot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition point of view in this debate has been adequately expressed by the previous speakers who have detailed the reasons why we should not have nationalised medicine and who have promoted the cause for a continuation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in all types of medical and hospital benefits and for the best possible quality of health care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have risen in this debate to expose the treachery of the Labor Government’s action and to let the people of Queensland know that under this proposal every one of them will have to pay more for exactly the same type of service that they have at the present time, with the added restriction of not having the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This scheme does not interfere with one’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of a doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, this presents a challenge for us to search around and to discover new and more efficient ways to provide health services while, at the same time, maintaining rights of choice, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of quality of care and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not need a cradle-to-the-grave society in which the Government will dictate all aspects of our daily lives, and expect those of us who still want to work to pay dearly for the ultimate welfare state in which the individual will lose all <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the capacity to plan his destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is to continue as an institution of free speech, able and willing to face the challenges it is meeting from elsewhere to its capacity, its authority and even to its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of debate it will need the support of all our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on equity; it is based on a sense of justice; it will ensure that every person in this community is covered for health insurance purposes; and, most certainly, it is based on a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose the private medical practitioner that one cares to use and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose the type of hospital treatment that one cares to draw upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the benefits that the community stands to gain: For individual citizens our health insurance program will mean an automatic health insurance cover that is based on a more equitable system of payment and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the doctor and the type of hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government says: ‘We will grab the lot of you and take away your <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have said, as  Mr Chipp  continued to say today, that we were going to nationalise medicine; we were going to prevent <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice; we were going to destroy the doctor- patient relationship; we were going to wreck the hospital system; we were going to give much less service at far greater cost; we were going to socialise, centralise and bureaucratise; and we were going to reduce proud, vigorous and individualistic Australians to mere ciphers on some remote computer roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example I refer to the allegation that we are out to destroy the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which exists in the present scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be repeated too often that the charge about destruction of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is simply untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In act, far from restricting <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice the new scheme will expand it in many important respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot, on the one hand, say that the public desperately wants to preserve its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor but then say on the other hand that for the sake of an after-tax contribution of less than $1 a week they will desert their private doctors, desert that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in a great stampede for the standard wards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points we made were, firstly, that it would lower the quality of medical care to Australian families; second, that it would increase the total cost to the Government and thus to the taxpayer; third, that it would increase the cost to an individual because, in addition to increased taxation, expensive additional private insurance would be required to maintain health care standards; fourth, that it would reduce the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctors and hospitals; fifth, that it would jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and, sixth, that it would be the first stage of nationalisation of health care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point concerns <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and religious hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much for the Government’s claim that it will not restrict <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>“What is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice if a person does not have the right to go to a private or religious hospital if he so chooses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Acting Chairman,  the Government should stop its senseless, socialist stampede for a costly, unworkable scheme that will reduce health care standards, reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and put many of our hospitals at peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that the right to good health is a basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and that medical treatment should not rest on ability to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To pretend that this is a system which will give <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is to overlook so many facets which have to be explored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more one looks into the matter the more it seems that the important <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to the Opposition is that of the consultant to get his fee for service from the patient who is forced, because of the application of the means test, into the private or intermediate ward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will preserve the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the doctor and the patient, and it will allow people to insure against the cost of private hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of all this there are people from one end of Australia to the other asking themselves why the Government is trying to throw out a health scheme which the overwhelming majority of them have found perfectly satisfactory, which has given them good quality health care at reasonable cost with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor and hospital and health insurance fund, and with speed and compassion, and in which they have genuine confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over and over, in written and spoken words, the Government has said that there will be complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measure of the government in a democracy surely must be its capacity and performance in preventing exploitation, whether it be exploitation of individuals, groups of individuals, of resources or indeed of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government had allowed the Australian mining industry such an enormous amount of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> over its operations, including the writing of long term contracts and the unilateral determination of export prices, that in some cases policies were being followed that were harmful instead of helpful to our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It violates a very basic principle that I regard as being of paramount importance, the basic principle of human rights, of personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, the right of the individual to privacy in personal matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a situation in which there is the obvious collaboration of outside interests who wish to create something similar to what happened in Chile and in other nations where <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has been suppressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, it provides an opportunity for producer <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and market orientated farm policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They can satisfy <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and they can be a very salutory instrument for containing the excessive pressures towards inflation that occur in Australia and also come from outside Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the universal health insurance program which will come into operation on 1 July next year is essentially based on the private practice of medicine, on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of one’s medical practitioner and on the payment of that medical practitioner by fee for service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It meant <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from pollution of the often high water table in the region, particularly in the Canning area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do so because the Australian Labor Party, through its activities and through its efforts to stifle <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and democracy, is setting out to reduce to nothing more than a farce and a laugh the talk back programs in which people ring radio stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As always the Opposition will co-operate in putting through a measure such as this, which is both reasonable and progressive and which in a specific way is designed to uphold the dignity and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel very keenly about the denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and opportunity which is part of this Government’s education policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As my colleague the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  said the morning after the Budget was introduced, it is quite clear that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for parents is under blunt attack, and indeed it is under blunt attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will make a lot of people feel that real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is under very, very direct attack, because there are many hundreds of thousands of people in this community who are prepared to make additional sacrifices to exercise a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are not privileged people, but they are people who feel they ought to have the right to exercise this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is under very, very severe attack and limitation by this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the benefits of a high capacity line and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from interruptions to the service by floods provided for the Northern Territory by this line, further advantage will come from the construction of the standard gauge link from Adelaide to Crystal Brook which is the subject of separate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great objective of the Labor movement was social justice based on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole philosophy of the Prime Minister and his storm troopers is to wipe out the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and to bring every phase of his life under control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the indivdual was mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as that decision became public there was a great deal of disquiet and I certainly took the first opportunity to condemn the decision that by according de jure recognition to the incorporation the Australian Government was giving the force of law to a de facto act of military domination, invasion and suppression of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the peoples of those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When 90 per cent of the wage and salary earners earn much less than $10,000 per year it is nonsense to talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individual choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to reduce the income tax deduction for education expenses strikes not only at the non-government schools, which was its intention, motivated by the desire to restrict <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, but also at the young mothers and the single parent families who depend on pre-schools and kindergartens, which are often costly, while they make a living to support their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This decision of the Government is illustrative of the fact that deep down it is not a government which shares a permanent commit-, ment to the maintenance of a real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We deplore this decision not only because of the monetary deprivation of many families throughout Australia that will result from its implementation but also and above all because it represents a basic rejection of the principle of maintaining a real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one of the chief bastions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that the people have and yet, like <span class="highlight">freedom</span> itself, it is not sufficiently appreciated or valued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a great and growing concern in the community that child care should, firstly, be made available to those people who have a real need but ought to be available also to any woman and to any family wishing to have facilities for minding their children if those people wish to be employed or wish to exercise some <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in regard to working or undertaking other activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The outcome of this review will depend upon the final form of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-55-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However in view of the current military situation, and in particular the lack of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement for UNFICYP in the Turkish controlled sector, contributing countries have been asked not to act on earlier requests for additional civilian police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to this, if we look to the immediate future, every flow statistic that there is available, including the flow statistics that are available from the Hancock Committee report which he commissioned, new vacancies notified, placements confirmed and forward financial data, indicate that with a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose, without effective direction of labour, full employment will not be with us for quite a number of months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the next few days we are going to be privileged as a parliament to receive a Bill which will seek to extend to the whole of the people of Australia, whether they are ex-servicemen or migrants, no matter who they are, the right to one of the basic freedoms for which every parliament and every government should strive, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other speakers for the Government have pointed out the length of time since the tabling of the report and the wide opportunities that the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation,  Senator Wheeldon,  has offered to everyone in the community to comment, apart from their initial <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make submissions to the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How many families with an income of $4,000, $5,000 or even $6,000 a year can afford the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to send their children to independent schools which have school fees of $300, $400 or $500 a year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also said on that occasion and on a previous occasion when I issued a statement last Friday that the Opposition rejects and abhors South Africa’s inhumane policy of apartheid, and in particular it deplores the South African Government’s recent extension of repressive laws and the further suppression of racial equality and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be recalled that during his speech he referred, among other things, to the ‘inalienable rights of all people to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last 2 weeks it has been brought to the attention of this chamber that an Eastern European diplomat had the courage of his convictions to go to an Australian embassy and ask for political asylum and that this Government which is prepared to stand up in the United Nations and talk about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and the need for political asylum, refused that man his individual rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Portuguese Timor itelf, despite the small size of the politically conscious minority, which probably amounts to less than 3,000 at the outside, there has been a surprising amount of political activity since the new Government disbanded the political police and allowed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of political activity, shortly after coming to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having cleared the dust away from planning policies established years and years ago it has revealed the availability of frequencies for broadcasting that will allow the development of a genuine <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of communication in this country- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of communication for the many rather than the few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it were to be conducted on a political base all that was likely to happen was that attitudes may get frozen in and there would not be the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would be tantamount, in a commercial context, to preventing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of a person wishing to commission a film organisation to make a film, expressing his opinion on how the film should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Similarly the Bill provides for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and flexibility in financial operations which Film Australia has not had in the past and will enable the Commission to co-ordinate and operate in the closest of harmony with the demands of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Delegates to the convention of the Federation of Australian Broadcasters, which includes some Labor Party controlled stations, unanimously affirmed their determination to support the principles that the public is best served by the continuance of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the commercial broadcasting industry to program their stations in accordance with the demonstrable interests of the communities which they serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as it is within the power of an Opposition to ensure that there is a desirable <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, we are trying to ensure that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Transmitted to the area we are now discussing, no government or no authority ought to take it upon itself the right to traffic in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and I believe that that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable gentlemen who spoke out this morning in praise and in defence of human <span class="highlight">freedom</span> not only have lived with this situation of the monopolisation of communication in Australia ever since they came to power in 1949; they have actively abetted the process by which consolidation increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would expect, and indeed it is the policy of this Government, that adults should have the uttermost <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in what they see, hear or read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, and I cannot stress this point too strongly, an elector will retain the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express a preference for as many additional candidates as he pleases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do so because this system is most conducive to the progress and the well-being of Australia, and most conducive to the democratic protection of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, the policies of the Australian Government in respect of Aboriginal people might be described as seeking: to encourage and strengthen the capacity of Aboriginals to manage their own affairs and to increase their economic independence; to enable Aboriginals to have a real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice about their life style and the extent to which, particularly in the more remote communities, they maintain their traditional customs and culture- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which can be exercised to the extent that communities have local authority, in particular through land ownership; to make equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians by working to overcome those handicaps which generally face them in fields such as housing, health, education, employment and civil liberties; in doing this, to help Aboriginals themselves to provide services designed to overcome handicapsfor instance through Aboriginal housing societies, medical services and legal services; and to act in the closest consultation with Aboriginal communities and individuals at both the national and the local levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All this adds up to a most alarming situation for those people who believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this moment in Australia’s history governments should be seeking constructive ways of extending <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to parents instead of taking it away from those who presently exert it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should seek imaginative and novel approaches to the funding of education, perhaps through tax credits, perhaps through voucher schemes and perhaps through other techniques to see that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is extended right throughout the community instead of shrunk to a smaller and smaller segment of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should seek constructive ways of extending <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice instead of narrowing it just when people are crying out to have a say in their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the communists overran Hungary in 1949 he was imprisoned by them because he stood up for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the church. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That matter was put on the agenda of the Assembly, not because those individual cases would normally be of international concern, but because it was felt strongly that, in the guise of administering criminal law, actually what was being attemped in those States was interference with fundamental freedoms- in this instance <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religious worship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 April 1973, I wrote to all Ministers suggesting that they exercise their discretion on items of current interest and in cases of doubt should await the criteria for release of documents in the proposed <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> ‘of Information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proposed <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Legislation- tabled in Parliament on 5 December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-81-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously, that goes to the very basis of the human <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the people in Darwin who are anxious to re-establish themselves in their normal way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 25th anniversary of which was celebrated on 10 December 1973, proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Moreover, the amendments do not deal in any way with the matters of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of an Aboriginal on to a reserve, legal representations before, and appeal from, Aboriginal courts, compulsory labour and the other unsatisfactory features of the Queensland laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the Labor scheme and the action proposed by the Minister which, as I say, he has been good enough to forget today in this one respect in the face of the reality of the Senate amendment, would reduce the personal responsibility and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the individual regarding doctor, fund, ward or hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question that has to be decided is really this: Is it preferable for matters to be resolved by agreement of responsible and knowledgeable parties to an industrial relationship with full <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to determine for themselves the most appropriate ways and means, or should free consideration of the matter be circumscribed by the forced intervention of, and procedures prescribed by, a stranger to that relationship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contemporary crisis in family relationships results from a large variety of factors including changes in the social philosophy which are emphasising increasingly the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to develop his own philosophy of life and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to acquire the tools for an analysis of problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This new found <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of women- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which allows them to develop their God-given intellect and talents in a way they have never been able to develop them beforemeans that we have to look very seriously at the whole structural relationships of our society, particularly the family structural relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It must be very careful that it does not bring down laws that will ultimately work against the principles upon which this society of ours is based- the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the rights of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a weak moment, Australia could find itself, in the euphoria of a conference, involved in some international agreement that could well limit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the rights of an individual within a community or society, for the sole purpose of trying to preserve the environment as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Government does not plan initially to regionalise operations- at least I have not heard of those plans- and to place people in areas so that basically they will get on to a particular doctor’s list and be able to go only to that doctor, there is no question but that ultimately the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of family doctor will be affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Medibank will not interfere with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the patient-doctor, doctor-doctor, patient-patient and patient-nurse etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There will be complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor by the patient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is said that we will not have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of our doctor, we will go onto a list and we will become a number on a card in a pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, there is no reason why there should be an increase in the area in which there will not be a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of the measures which we would introduce would be part of the continuing reform of the health insurance system, which will ensure comprehensive coverage of the entire community while maintaining <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and a private system, not a socialised, nationalised scheme which financially is airy-fairy and could cost this country millions of dollars more than the present Government has estimated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we want to see is the unionists throughout this country given real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its creation as a separate statutory authority had been mooted for some time in order to enhance its creative <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, remove bureaucratic inhibitions, mainly audit and Treasury, and prevent its use as a mere propaganda medium for the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government remains insistent that it control the Commission for purposes of departmental industrial promotion activities, it could well consider separation of (b) (i) from (b) (ii) and (b) (hi) in clause 5( 1 ), to allow the general production of Australian films to proceed in maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> without the threat of ministerial interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a danger and it has to be faced, as have others, but I think that if the Government is going to put responsible people on these boards they must be given not necessarily the ultimate decision but certainly a very wide range of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement because it is the people on the ground, the consumers, the artists, who really know ultimately where their problems he. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must therefore balance the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of those in the monopoly position to continue their monopoly against the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of those who would otherwise wish to exercise their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of enterprise, but are prevented from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe, in accordance with the Liberal philosophy, that much the better way in which to organise society is to allow the greatest economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to individuals by seeing that the total income and the total wealth of the community are distributed on as wide a base as is possible down to the individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that financial power through income and wealth is diverted from individuals and placed into the hands of the state through Crown corporations such as this, individuals are denied economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is a fundamental of personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why I take the opportunity now to endeavour to point out the differences between the philosophy of the Liberal and Country Parties who believe in individual economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and private enterprise and the philosophy of public enterprise and nationalisation of the socialists who occupy the Government benches today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that regard I would have expected that the Minister, if he were pursuing a program of greater economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for individuals to acquire their own homes and to be able to afford to pay for those homes during their lifetime, would have looked to providing mechanisms or facilities through the private financial institutions of Australia for giving to the people the financial capacity to acquire their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This whole affair does raise serious questions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice; questions of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this the kind of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice  Mr Kerry  Packer is so concerned to protect, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Packer dynasty to mould public opinion to its own purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need an inquiry to determine how we can ensure the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the media, free from the arbitrary control of the few to distort and slant information to their own purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do strongly and deeply believe that every person has the right to live in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, with dignity and with opportunities to pursue his or her own objectives and to achieve personal happiness and true realisation; and that the State has the duty not to obstruct those activities within the law but to remove impediments to their realisation and to protect individual privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are talking about in respect to marriage is, in one sense, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is always a prima facie case for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>; because men must not be used merely as tools, the onus of proof always rests on whoever wants to limit it not on those enjoying it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also a special case for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association over and above the formal prima facie case for not interfering, analagous in some respects to the special case for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the only just and humane course is to allow citizens maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to work out these complexities in as dignified and humane a way as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Labor Government that stands before the world mouthing new standards of intellectual platitudes fails to appreciate the fact that when the Ho Chi Minn Government took over in North Vietnam, with the failure of the French and their withdrawal, over 1 million North Vietnamese were taken from their villages, hamlets and towns and most of them never returned because members of the Communist regime of the North appreciated the fundamental dictum that their power would remain only while they were able to crush, utterly expunge from their society any possibility whatsoever that there would still remain a flicker of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the minds of men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am raising the great democratic principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision represents an intrusion on the personal liberty and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech of every migrant in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But further than that, people who believe in the liberty and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of these people whom we are inviting to Australia to make their home ought to resent this action just as deeply as my colleague the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  resents it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its fundamental tenet supposedly is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, but it is highly noticeable that in its application it would not only preserve but also would greatly extend the welfare and influence of the most privileged sections of our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably the principal theme of his philosophy is what he chose to describe as the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend one’s own income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which must be expanded is control by individuals of the income they earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> to spend one’s own income is just as important as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, of religion, and of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taken to their logical conclusions they seem to be a prescription for the complete abolition of income tax since this would clearly maximise the so-called <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend one’s own income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the  23  years that they governed from  1949  till  1972  this supposed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> was steadily eroded by continual increases in the tax burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend one ‘s income was considerably reduced by successive Liberal-County Party governments, presumably because they considered there were community needs that should be fulfilled and would be best fulfilled by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Highly paid persons who pay a larger proportion of their income in income tax than low paid persons accordingly have their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend their incomes restricted much more than low income earners and so will have more to gain from the application of a philosophy that seeks to redress that supposed inhibition on <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most of them the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend one’s own income is rather more curtailed than it is in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, if we are now to embark on a policy, as the Opposition would have us do, of maximising the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals to spend their own income, we would be wildly out of step with the rest of the developed world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably he regards this as enforced equality and an interference with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of single taxpayers to spend their own income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Opposition bases its elitist program on the supposed extention of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual illustrates dramatically what a jaundiced concept it has of human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here we have the real substance of the man who dresses up his opposition to public expenditure by saying that he is in favour of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and that the provision of services by a government is in some way inimical to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader dresses up his opposition to public expenditure by saying that in some way it impinges on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice those people have or which the Leader of the Opposition would preserve for them is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to starve and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to remain poor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the Prime Minister’s studied insult of the Returned Services League, its saying that the price of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is eternal vigilance could never be more relevant and nothing could be further from Labor’s policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing that we would be providing to the people, to the working man and woman of Australia an economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which equates with personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more government takes from people’s earnings the more it lessens their economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the more it lessens their personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus the Budget reduces the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition attaches a very special meaning to the idea of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It went on to emphasise full employment and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in that employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The residents of Hobart ‘s eastern shore have been denied their cars and feel they have been stripped of their autonomy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the colleagues of these members and their friends paid the supreme sacrifice in defence of their country and of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should the RSL be happy at the state of our shrinking deomoralised defence forces or should it remind the public of its motto: ‘The price of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is eternal vigilance’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a system which guarantees political <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the rights of the individual by decentralised power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In the few minutes available to me this evening I want to say something about the concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as advanced by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  or rather, as I prefer to term it, more Fraser foolishness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberals believe that maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from dictation and regulation is essential to self respect and self fulfilment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without <span class="highlight">freedom</span> there is no self respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to strive and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to achieve and to seek excellencefreedom to be different and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to conform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the control to which he most objects is that of taxation, because this restricts the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to spend the income he or she earns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, he says, is a basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> without which other freedoms, such as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, association and so on, are meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If individuals do not have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to control thenown lives they do not have self-respect and they do not have dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concepts of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, human dignity and self-respect are apparently new-found ones for the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On analysis it would seem that the only <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in which the Leader of the Opposition is really interested is that of retaining control over one’s own income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person on an inadequate income may have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to send his children to the best schools or to choose the best doctor, but he will find those freedoms meaningless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet efforts to ensure that all Australians are in a position to enjoy the freedoms we value are described by the Leader of the Opposition as ‘enforced equality’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The young Australians of this nation might well remember the bitter experience of the 1960s, when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Defence and his concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> was the right to be conscripted and sent off to fight in a tragic, useless political war to salve the political consciences of supporters abroad and supporters who profited from that political war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of enormous importance to us that we be able to maintain our position as a great trading nation, for without the maintenance of our great trading position we will find that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action that we want to take in economic management will be foreclosed from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it was some obscure Frenchman who once said that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is the luxury of the disciplined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one removes the discipline, axiomatically one destroys <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not all of it, but there were many whom the Government you supported allowed into this country who claimed they were <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters from Hungary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know people in these countries have not got <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We got a lot of the so-called <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When members of the Opposition say they want less government so that there will be more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> they really mean that they want to cut back on these sorts of initiatives, cut back on education and cut back on urban improvement so that there will be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the wealthy- those who have had a happy and wealthy inheritance- to hang on to what they have and to mimimise their liability to support the rest of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is very good for a minority, but it is not too good for the great majority of people whose only <span class="highlight">freedom</span> without the support of an adequate functioning government role is never to succeed or to succeed in a very uneven sort of way, to have few satisfactions in life and to achieve very little compared with what they would like to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These were socialist reports designed to destroy <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and free enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have suggested that this is a clear indication of a government intention to control the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In socialist regimes the world over the prime requisite for controlling a populace is to control <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of drought, speech, action and religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether people believe the worst of Labor’s intentions concerning control of the Press, whether any allegations or criticisms which I make are 100 per cent right or whether the people within the news industry are convinced that there is real risk, no government so accused can be given the benefit of any doubt in the matter of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we err at all in this matter of Press <span class="highlight">freedom</span> it must be on the side of over-caution and over-suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am seeking to sound a solemn warning to the people of Australia and to the people within the media industry, which they will ignore at their own and their country’s peril, that one of the fundamental principles of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has been breached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could claim yet another first- a new formula for nationalising the mass media and how to take away a people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> without their knowing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people do not have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of access to information on the events which are occurring in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One talks about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press, yet in America and in England when articles like this are printed the publishers can be taken before a council and dealt with accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways of achieving <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression is to have a lot of people who have power to publish without restriction on their opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press that we hear so much about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The owners of the mass media’ reacted so violently to this suggestion, even likening the Minister for the Media to the Nazi propaganda Minister  Dr Goebbels,  that their very reaction was a clear indication within itself that as things are now we have little <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press but rather a jealously guarded privilege of a few people to influence public opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet even the suggestion that a similar Press council might be a subject for discussion in Australia was greeted with outraged cries of limitations on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press in Australia boils down to a monopoly of a few people having the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to disseminate news- I make a clear distinction between news and information- the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to print only the news that they want to print and, where necessary, to ignore or to suppress other relevant information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is inclined to feel this has more to do with the interests those policies challenge than with any genuine concern over centralised control and alleged loss of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by the general public <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It clearly indicates the desirability in proceedings where a person’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is involved of having the assistance of legal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To be held in prison without trial and without recourse to justice is probably one of the greatest infringements of the basic human rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and liberty, particularly when the Indonesian officials admit that such prisoners were not involved with the coup in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will probably not fully recognise the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of political activity which they enjoy in Australia, and I wish to impress upon them by comparison the names of 17 former members of the Indonesian Parliament who were detained during 1965 and 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we ignore infringements of liberty, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the rights of men and women throughout the world we cheapen the respect we hold for our own freedoms and we move closer to the total enslavement of all mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish merely to make it quite clear that no State can maintain its sovereignty unless it has a system of internal surveillance such as ASIO to defend the state against those persons, both within and without, who want to see the Australian people lose their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an essential part of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence for a person to have the ability, whatever level of industry or commerce he might find himself in, to choose meaningful employment, and having chosen that form of employment, he must then thave the capacity to influence his work environment and gain satisfaction from what he is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are embarking on a program based on the principles I have just enunciated- a program that respects <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion and expression, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to work and to enjoy the fruits of that work, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from the totalitarian control of all-pervading power of the allpowerful state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  His Excellency  outlined in his speech, the Government is implementing a foreign affairs and defence policy aimed at securing our continued enjoyment of our hard-earned <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, in its defence policy and indeed in the major steps which it has already taken to upgrade Australia’s defence capability, has shown a clear recognition of the vital need for strong preparedness in the face of aggression by the Marxist anti-<span class="highlight">freedom</span> forces in so many parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely no one can doubt that the basic cause of disruption in the world at this time is the clash of ideologies between the forces of international communism and those which respect <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and the attempt of the forces of world socialism to inflict by force their ideology on the entire world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a choice between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and of expression, and control by the state which directs our thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a simple choice- <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The problems facing my constituents are common throughout Australia: The care and attention of the aged; the handicapped and the under privileged; a reduction and review of crippling taxes; a reduction of inflation; a return to full employment; a transfer of emphasis from the public to the private sector; the opportunity to own a home; a return to a society based upon <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in all respects, not a socialist welfare state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a path of security and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for all, one that will lead to greater opportunity for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed so that our people, today’s and future generations, can live in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> where the individual works and progresses on merit and not by handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most significant limitation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in this society would be poverty and inadequate opportunities for reasonable education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view the government policy could be seen as nothing more than cutting back on what we as a Labor government tried to establish to improve the quality of life, to protect the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the community from exploitation by ruthless business practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It proves that the Government does not believe in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> it carries on about when it attacks the Opposition because it knows there is no such thing as complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone would think from the way the Government protests about ‘the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Australians to choose’- these words are contained in the Governor-General’s Speech- that this country was governed initially by some communist monstrosity which laid down all sorts of restrictions and that since then the job of government, the course of human progress, has been to break it all down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  for whom most of us on this side of the House have considerable respect, will see fit to use his good offices with the other countries of the Commonwealth in an endeavour to remove or eliminate the persecution of Jehovah ‘s Witnesses in accordance with the principles of the United Nations in respect of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The objection I raise is that there will be a loss of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What comes out over and over again in that proposition as it was to be applied to the United Kingdom and as it has been subsequently applied to Australia, is that it is impossible to have full employment with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in a society unless there is a confidently expanding private enterprise sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those two propositions come face to face- the requirement of full employment and the requirement of private enterprise to enable <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to be exercised in the attainment of full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at households and the way by which governments have impressed in a quite remarkable way their own impression upon the activity of households, we see that the power of the purse has been used to deprive those basic units of our society of their own <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What I suggest is that thinking in terms of a competitive economy, in terms of laissez-faire, in terms of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>- <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of enterprise, competition and so on- we are missing the whole significance of the trend that is going on before our eyes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The references to the environment and other matters to which Labor has subscribed and in which we share with it in aspiration but differ from it in technique, is clear evidence of the fact that we want growth and want to assist the underprivileged and disadvantaged with maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for them, maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and maximum human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir John  Kerr will be remembered long after the ghosts of the Labor Party because he was a lover of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, a defender and upholder of democracy, a man who not only believed in democracy but who knew that once you limit it you virtually lose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a longer term aim, the ASEAN nations have adopted the concept of South-East Asia as a zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality- ZOPFAN as it is often referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My purpose in standing at the election was to ensure that not only the people of Wilmot but also the people of Australia could look forward with assurance to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this great country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen a period of 3 years of government in which people were not sure that they, their children or their grandchildren could look forward with confidence to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe very firmly that the election of 13 December was fought on the basis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was fought on the basis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and people throughout Australia were genuinely concerned that their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> was being impinged upon and undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also welcome His Excellency’s statement that the Government’s aim is to encourage the development of an Australia in which the people have maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence to achieve their goals in life in ways in which they decide and the recognition that the disadvantaged must be helped in ways which leave them the maximum independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other important factors include a new emphasis on equality of education opportunities, continuing research into the quality and direction of education and greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and community involvement in the educational enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To stifle criticism of the political actions of the Governor-General would be to stifle <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such action were to be taken it would be a major step towards the destruction of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere contemplation of using the Crimes Act to silence the Opposition is colossal hypocrisy from a government that gained power by making outlandish accusations of dictatorship against the Labor Government in general, and Prime Minister Whitlam in particular and is even now pontificating about how it stands basically for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that must be expanded is control by individuals of the income they earn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> to spend one’s own income is just as important as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, of religion and of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then this curious concept of fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has been further developed, and its fullest expression is to be found in the speech of the Prime Minister in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The message now is that true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is to be found only in a society with a small public or government sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An increasing public sector is seen as reducing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals and as an attempt to ‘determine people’s lives for them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This pseudophilosophy is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to provide principle where none exists, to disguise blind and selfish reaction to the redistribution of income and resources as the defence of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the United States figure, at 29.6 per cent was well above that for Australia, while below us were such countries as Spain, Portugal and Greece, countries which have not been exactly noted for zealously safeguarding the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Labor was guilty of inhibiting <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by raising the proportion of government expenditure in this country, how much more guilty are the governments of the other capitalist countries in the world, many of which are anything but socialist? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, it is grossly hypocritical for the coalition parties to accuse a government that increases the size of the public sector and increases the burden of taxation of destroying <span class="highlight">freedom</span>., When the Liberal and Country Parties were in office, they did precisely that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no doubt that if increasing the size of the public sector and so increasing taxation inhibits <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, then the Liberal and National Country Parties have much to answer for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving that aside and leaving aside the Prime Minister’s more inane accusations, such as the one that Labor was trying to determine the fate of every person in this country, what case is there for arguing that increasing the public sector reduces the level of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that one can argue that way only if one ignores the expansion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that comes from government expenditure and concentrates on the reduced <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals to spend their income as a result of paying more tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to ignore the expansion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that comes from increased government expenditure is to ignore the point of the whole exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can anyone deny that those increased welfare benefits did other than increase the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the recipients to live a normal life rather than the poverty stricken existence that was their lot under previous coalition governments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By greatly increasing government expenditure on education we enhanced the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of students to gain knowledge and understanding and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to have a more equal opportunity in life than would otherwise have been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly absurd to argue that increasing the size of the public sector necessarily involves a diminution in the total sum of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, particularly when it was already at a level well below the average for comparable countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So surely it cannot be said that there is any lack of enterprise, and allied with that there is a lack of repressive legislation on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual in such areas as censorship, for instance, which puts Australia and especially Queensland to shame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I believe the theme of the GovernorGeneral’s address and the Government’s overall philosophical concept was summed up in the statement that the Government’s long term objective was to encourage a development of an Australia in which people have maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence to achieve their own goals in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my recollection is correct, an interdepartmental committee was established to furnish a report which was designed to be a framework for legislation on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of access to information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we exercise what the Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay)  described as a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice- that is, for the employee to choose to work in the centre of the city where the Government tells him he has to work, which is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice he has at the moment- we also compel that person to spend half of his working day getting to and from his place of employment in the most frustrating and demoralising circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that that will allow the Committee to act with the same flexibility and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as did the previous Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister responsible for the creation of the original Committee in 1973, and having a feeling about the way in which this Parliament ought to work and about its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to operate without duress or restrictions imposed by the Executive and the ministry, I wrote that particular clause into the motion myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the basic flaw of such a philosophy is that in reality only the privileged few can exploit the opportunities, enjoy the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and make the choices they cherish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party platform sets out quite clearly that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in the Press, radio and television and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from governmental and political interference are fundamental to Liberal beliefs and essential to democratic government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that these statements demonstrate quite clearly that the Commission will not be prejudiced in its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression which it currently enjoys or the active role it now plays in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Act is a potential danger to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, and the offence of sedition should be amended to require an intent to incite riotous or disorderly conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the Government’s long term objective is ‘to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government; it is the underlying philosophy which the Government made clear in its expressed intention to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence to achieve their own goals in life in the way they decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Democratic government and democratic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as we know them would have been history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, complete censorship would have been imposed on all the broadcasting media so that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Presstwo of the basic tenets of democracy- would have been denied to every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet, to my amazement, certain prominent journalists in Canberra and elsewhere continue their support for Labor even though Labor proposes to destroy the basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which all journalists constantly say they support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Journalists say that they support freedoms, but the sincerity of their statements must be questioned because of the obvious sympathy of many of them with communist regimes around the world, regimes which practise all the complete antitheses of democracymurder, deceit and class hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great Party that the honourable member purports to represent says that it stands on the basis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, and promptly proceeds to assail those who exercise that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and choose to rent a house rather than buy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I finish my remarks, I want to point out that as well as any possible or potential external threat to this nation, there is the ever serious encroachment upon the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is exactly the reverse of the Labor Party’s attitude over the last 3 years it has attempted to strip the citizen of his will to defend the state against any external threat and at the same time so encroached upon his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as to deprive him of his ability to defend himself from the state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s policy is directed towards gradual restructuring of local manufacturing to achieve increased competitiveness, and more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From that time forward the presence of Soviet soldiers on Polish soil made it quite certain that there would be no <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that 10 February 1976 will be remembered by all Australians who believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as a day of shame for international democracy, a day of the deprivation of the rights and liberties of the people of Poland, and a day of sadness for all who love <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and all who believe that one day we will see a free Poland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That  so  encouraged people in Poland to believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that Professor Edward Lipinski and a number of Polish intellectuals came out into the open and wrote a letter to the  Speaker  of the Polish Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet another trio of nails was hammered into the coffin of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, in Poland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that by our actions other Parliaments will be encouraged to express similar views and that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will be told that what it has done has not met with the approval of the people of Australia and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> loving people throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons why <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is in fact under threat not only in Poland but also in many other countries is exhibited by what is happening in this House this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the matter under discussion is an important issue and there ought to be discussions on questions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> because if Parliament means anything in Australia surely it means the existence of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and we ought to do as much as possible to encourage the existence of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the honourable member for Mackellar would agree with me, when he is not in one of his hypocritical moods, that there has been no practical <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Poland for many years now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, Poland has had very little <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in its whole history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  pointed out, there are some ISO countries in the United Nations and I think about twenty three of them would get a clearance on any significant basis of having <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said a minute ago, the state of this House exhibits why <span class="highlight">freedom</span> disappears in many countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a country is living next to a giant such as the Soviet Union it is even easier for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to disappear, as happened in the case of Poland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s programs will continue to improve and to provide for the people of this nation, particularly the people of New South Wales, a better way of life, a way of life that they themselves can control, a way of life that will not be directed from Canberra, a way of life that will allow them to exercise their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the democratic right that all thinking people value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Removal at the end of 1976 of the existing control over reversions will give the vehicle builders <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to determine which components they will source locally to make up their 85 per cent local content and which they will import to make up the remainder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-48-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real debate on Medibank is actually on the degree or the percentage of the private and the public shares of the medical and hospital sector, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice available to patients, the level of the levy, the cost containment procedures, the correction of anomalies evident in the original scheme and the updating of cost and other procedures due to the passage of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760818_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He also demonstrated by the way in which he commented on employment and on business activity the essential relationship between successful business, successful <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of enterprise in Australia and an improvement in the disastrous levels of unemployment that we have and which were brought about by honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760825_reps_30_hor100/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reasons our particular system arrives at a situation such as this difficult one of stagflation can be explained by describing the trade cycle and demonstrating how <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is given to many different institutions, whether they are different companies, whether they are called Gove, Hamersley, Mount Newman or whatever in the various countries, to make these decisions separately and independently of each other without any economic planning and arriving at an overstocking situation in so many areas and then, of course, stocks- this happens in country that operates under a similar sort of system- are bound to run down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In theory the new federalism policy is supposed to place the States in a better financial position because it will give them access to a growth tax, namely personal income tax, and because it will give them greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in making decisions because there will be an increase in the untied grants at the expense of tied grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With an exhibition of the sleight of hand with which this Government has become quite expert, the Federal Government gives the States more revenue and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with one hand and takes them away with the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to give the States more financial assistance grants money and to urge them to spend it as they see fit, but what <span class="highlight">freedom</span> do the States have if it is virtually preordained that they have to use this money to make up for real decreases in the other grants which were given to them previously? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the States will have to reduce the services they offer, or if they happen to want <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to follow policies different from Federal Government policies they will have to impose additional taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He invited or encouraged voluntary health funds to set up- in other words, he enlarged the number of organisations which were already doing this sort of thing- by setting a restraint on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with which members of the community could get their tax contributions back in the form of medical or hospital rebates, because an integral part of the system was that the patient had to contribute to a voluntary fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of complaints by many concerned citizens alleging that teenagers and persons in their early twenties have been induced to join certain religious sects and have, under the guise of exercising <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of worship actually had their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> severely restricted and in some cases have actually suffered serious physical and psychological harm? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously we are all concerned about the need to preserve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the other hand there may be a point- this is the matter I have been concerned with- that under the guise of religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the exercise of religious rights young people are subjected to all sorts of things that brainwash and indoctrinate them in a way that is an intrusion into human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is of great concern to the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations and is principally the reason why they support a zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality in relation to their own area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was fortunate early in the year to be able to speak and express my concern at the recent constitutional amendments in Poland and to applaud the efforts of Cardinal Mindszenty and the people of Poland who showed great courage in standing up in public and expressing their concern at the continuing decline of their freedoms in Poland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has already been mentioned, almost 20 years ago to the day hundreds of thousands of Hungarians protested about the lack of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in their country and demanded the release of the late Cardinal Mindszenty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take this opportunity to express my concern in the records of the Parliament and to express my sorrow and to extend my condolences to the Hungarians of Perth who tragically lost their country in 1956 and who came to our country where <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fortunately is still our most cherished possession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is on that basis that I say that our courts always stand for the best thing that I think the British have ever given us, that is, their system of justice where all people are equal and no man is denied a fair trial and no man is denied his <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although it appears that the extent of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> offered to the States under the theory and the practice of Fraser federalism are vastly different, it is obvious that in the theory little thought has been put into the implications of State income taxes for economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761103_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  subscribes to the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, why is he bringing forward a Bill designed to exclude certain sections and interest groups in the community from their democratic right to have access to one particular form of media outlet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The nub of the matter is that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press implies that anyone can publish his views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the concentration of present ownership in a few hands necessarily limits the range of views publishedthe antithesis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We in this Parliament ought to be more concerned about the debilitating effect of that on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of communication within this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The distribution of power in any society is an important element of preserving <span class="highlight">freedom</span> within that society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all power is located in one place, in one government or in a small group of people, there is a danger that the freedoms that a country enjoys can be taken away by abuse of that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761104_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the one hand there is the clear right to religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that is embedded to some extent in section 1 16 of our Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we need to ask whether the problem has ceased to be one of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion or rather is one of the protection of the young from skilfully organised people who are attempting to brainwash, indoctrinate and deprive people of property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues behind him that the Liberal Party platform sets out quite clearly that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in the Press, radio and television and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from governmental and political interference are fundamental to Liberal beliefs and essential to democratic government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They stand in this House day after day and year after year defending what they call the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press yet <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press turns out to be Press that can be stood over by the Liberal Party- Press that will only reflect the views and attitudes of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The thousands of people who assembled throughout Australia yesterday and today realised exactly what the Government is up to because they have seen demonstrated to them in this letter between the  President  of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Prime Minister of Australia what the Liberal Party really interpret as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I always find it remarkable that the conservative coalition parties can always declaim that they are opposed to compulsion and that they want <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in the community; yet they resort so frequently to the imposition of compulsion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These diverse, controversial views are intermit.tently aired over the ABC during those short spells when it frees itself from self-censorship until another burst of criticism of the ABC from so-called champions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expressionchampions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression as long as the expression is completely in accord with their views, of course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I come back to the concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice that this system offers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister, who believes in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, in free comment and in the independence of the ABC had this to say about a program that embarrassed the Fraser Government: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have already indicated that a delicate question is involved as to the religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that to some extent is enshrined in our Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, any government would have to be very careful, when introducing legislation in this area, to ensure that religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span> was not tampered with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact that is the claim that is often made; that we should give the commercials complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and then we shall get what we want because a lot of people look at these programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My bet is that if we give the commercials complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that will be the end of quality Australian production, in the sense of expensive production, because that, sadly, is usually what it means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee’s recommendations include: The Torres Strait Islands should remain part of Australia; that the Government should, as soon as feasible, make a statement in Parliament setting out its position on the Torres Strait boundary; if a protected zone is established in the area <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of passage for Australians and Papua New Guineans should be guaranteed, mining and drilling in the seabed should be prohibited until agreement is reached between all interested parties and new commercial ventures should not be permitted in the area unless they are compatible with the environment; and competent counsel should be provided to the Torres Strait Islanders if required by the people of Torres Strait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) With reference to the undertaking to enact <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information legislation, which has been given on 2 occasions in 1976, has the Government received the report of the interdepartmental committee to which the matter has been referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-94-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Down that road lies totalitarianism and the progressive restriction of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, the basic right of the individual to exercise the maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, compatible with the rights of his fellow citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the voters elected a Government which is dedicated to increasing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and the respect of his basic rights as an individual, while at the same time exercising its responsibility as a Government to protect and to assist those in our community who cannot care adequately for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They result inevitably from situations in which people are denied the exercise of basic human rights and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These control mechanisms can undoubtedly lead to all sorts of difficulties for industry and the more so in this sophisticated day and age when there is not the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement on the economic front that there might have been a few years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The important factor beyond any doubt is the belief that the Government espouses as the cardinal principle behind its philosophy, that is, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770222_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you are going to give <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in that sense to the people in an organised society- and the Australian community is an organised society, whether the Liberal Party likes it or not- all you are doing is saying to the people who cannot fight back, such as the people traditionally beaten down by the Liberal and Country parties, those who are incapable of fighting because they are young, because they are old, because they were not born here, because they have a language problem, because they were born poor, because they were born with a disability or because they incurred a disability, that everybody will have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to live his own life in the way that he chooses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In August 1968, when the Dubcek Government in Prague appeared to be engaged in policies inconsistent with the policies of Moscow, the result was that Warsaw Pact forces, including those of the U.S.S.R., by invasion of Czechoslovakia, caused a change in personnel in the government in Prague and caused a change in the minds of those who felt that they might indulge in policies more consistent with democratic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A reference to reform defamation laws, so vital for striking the right balance between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, on the one hand, and the maintenance of honour and reputation on the other hand was also given to the Law Reform Commission last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the form of the proposed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation is settled, it may be necessary to reconsider the provisions in the present Bill in the light of that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is important not only in this context of current economic policy, but for the pursuit of our basic Liberal objectives of enlarging the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals and of increasing the incentives to them, and their very capacity, to build a fuller life for themselves and a greater Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There must be an increasing commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, opportunity and equality so that people can make their own choices and live their lives in the way that they think is best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that it is wrong to interfere with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individual Australians, that perhaps we should not prevent them from engaging in activities overseas, that it would be contrary to their individual rights, but if we consider the question we realise that we are talking about the right to engage in hostile activities of the nature described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same thing of course would apply if people supported the illegal regime of Smith in Rhodesia or supported those who sought <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That cannot be tolerated in this country because there must be some effect or some potential effect upon the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and safety of our own citizens if any person in the community is to take up arms, explosives or the like and carry out training or similar activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British Committee of Privy Councillors looked into this matter in considerable detail and concluded that there were a number of reasons which might commend themselves to a government in order that it ban this activity, but that there was only one real reason to prevent it and that was that the restrictions on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of an individual to go and fight in another country were warranted because under international agreements the relations of the 2 countries could be seriously impaired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That this House further takes note of the implications of the Antarctic Treaty freezing existing territorial claims, providing that the Antarctic is to be used for peaceful purposes only (including a total ban on nuclear testing); guaranteed complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of access of scientific expeditions; facilitating international scientific co-operation and preserving Antarctic flora and fauna and the further provision that no new claim or enlargement of any existing claim shall be negotiated whilst the Treaty is in force; and the discussion paper prepared by the previous Administration entitled Towards new perspectives for Australian Scientific Research in Antarctica’ (March 1975- Parliamentary Paper No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member is trying to draw too strong a line in respect of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that the people who are resident in Australia have in taking an interest in the affairs of overseas countries, particularly when the country concerned is the one from which they have come and with which they have very close and very pertinent, sensitive family connections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All democrats in this House- I think there are one or two on the other side as well- should be prepared to stand up for the basic democratic principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association which is under attack by this left wing group of academics and their associates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kindness, loyalty and friendship have been shown to us wherever we have been, and, if on occasions, there has been a note of dissent, that is what <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression is all about- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> sadly no longer enjoyed in many other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the front page of this special issue under the heading ‘Human Rights and Socialism’ the statement is made that in the Soviet Union there is ‘the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion’, which of course stands most peculiarly alongside the correspondence I have just mentioned from the Soviet Embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> the Labor Party is referring to is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to be governed by big government, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to have government take decisions for him, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to have his initiative and his enterprise sapped and usurped by the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only thing that I think is important about the Indian election result as far as we in this Parliament are concerned is that for some reason or other many people claim that the citizens in the poorer countries- in the undeveloped nationsare interested only in food and not in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Indian elections have quite clearly shown that people who are given the choice are interested in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable members were to look at the particular electorate represented by the Minister of Justice in the previous Government, who introduced the legislation which restricted <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the previous Government, although admittedly only temporarily, they would find that he was defeated by a lawyer in exile, who was unable to campaign, who had to leave the country but yet received an overwhelming majority in the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The outlook for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is based on the problems the country is facing, the way the government and people are reacting to these problems, and the longer run political traditions of the society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What our society and this Parliament face at the present time is an exercise in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action which in the long run will lead to the destruction of the system upon which that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, in the more spectacular cases involving civil rights or the individual’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, the courts were to do anything other than scrutinise in the absolutely closest and most minute detail the entire position, there could be miscarriages of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is most important that where the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual is concerned both sides of the case be presented in detail, that all evidence be taken at length, that all the documents that are available be looked at and that the rules of law which apply be analysed carefully and applied by the judge or the higher tribunal on appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770505_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the Attorney-General who introduced the human rights Commission Bill which is presently before the House for consideration and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which will shortly be before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far from deterring opposition to apartheid, the denial of basic human rights and Press <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, which such measures represent, they are likely to have the opposite effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This can and may lead to intolerable political pressures in the broadcasting system which the Annan Committee in Great Britain criticised for its lack of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and news. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This country needs leadership that is strong, direct and purposeful, yet fair and compassionate; leadership that is morally and politically incorrupt and incorruptible; leadership that recognises and holds up high, above all else, the personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individual men and women; that puts people first, rejecting any notion of subservience to the State; leadership that recognises personal choice, initiative, enterprise and energy; leadership that withdraws from the nuts and bolts of everyday life decisionmaking and instead provides leadership- just that, leadership- which points the way by example and by deed and action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government promised in the Speech of the Governor-General that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation would be introduced to give members of the public right of access to Government documents where these can be made public without any harm to overriding public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded that the editorial in the  Age  on 22 February 1978 stated that a draft of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation had been sighted, that it left the curtain of bureaucratic secrecy pulled as tightly as ever and that it gave Ministers almost unlimited discretion to withold Government documents from public scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the proposed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation will in fact be simply a legal validation for the suppression of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the Soviet Union is too restricted for that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear that this Government does not believe that political equality is one of those matters which unite all Australians or, more importantly, that political equality is basic to giving Australians a greater measure of choice, power and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister knows that the greatest <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to experiment and innovate is present in the larger scale sectors in Australia where competition is reduced to the absolute minimum, but where capital is available on a scale which permits research, experimentation, evaluation and a rational approach to the development of company and corporate policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister is committed to the Governor-General’s word- I do not believe he is- about ‘giving the men and women of Australia a greater measure of choice, power and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’ it is to this corporate sector that he must turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General’s Speech included pious statements about ‘choice’ and ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span>’; about ‘expanding job opportunities’; about the ‘independence and self-respect’ of the growing body of people now dependent on social security because the economic masters- both in government and in the corporate sector- cannot and will not operate the economy in a way that will provide jobs and preserve the living standards of the work force of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While claiming to be interested in ‘choice ‘ and ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span>’, this Government is deliberately going about creating greater and greater inequality between labour and capital and between strong and weak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and marshal vigour we arise again and take our stand for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as in the olden times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the war in Timor is now a religious war, and it appalls me that Australia- a so-called Christian nation will stand by while thousands of our fellow Christians are systematically and ruthlessly massacred, raped and deprived of their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to challenge you at this stage,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  but surely one of the issues in the Parliament is that there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that a better society can only be realised by giving the men and women of Australia a greater measure of choice, power and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately for the blacks in South Africa there is a direct relationship between increased repressive measures and cries for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to talk of government policy and action, of facts not fiction, of the choice or lack of choice between suppression, prejudice, bigotry and imprisonment and that of the right of the individual to live in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the rule of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The saying of our time- ‘one man’s terrorist is another man’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighter’- is altogether pernicious so far as a constitutional democracy is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prohibit this generally would be an infringement of individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I frankly take the view that it would be disturbing in terms of people who respect the traditions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All this is done while the Government espouses, as the Governor-General stated in his Speech, its fundamental belief that a better society can be realised only by giving the men and women of Australia a greater measure of ‘choice, power and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement of empty rhetoric is accompanied by repressive action through the operation of an economic policy which diminishes, not increases, for most Australians their choice, their power and their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the banner of choice, power and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, the so-called fundamental belief of the Government, more Australians are denied economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the right to work and are rendered unproductive and powerless as unemployment is deliberately increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia, as I understand it, have always believed in fair play and in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to make decisions on these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make tonight concerns not so much the cost to the consumer but the cost to the principals involved in this country of so-called <span class="highlight">freedom</span> play. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been achieved whilst retaining those desirable principles of universal coverage, protection of pensioners and low income earners, and restoring <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that answer I pointed out that the Commonwealth is concerned to ensure that policies of self-management are pursued throughout Australia because through those policies Aboriginals, wherever they are, are enabled to live in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and to have independence in a way in which they can manage and control their own affairs like any other citizen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pass system will be instituted so that all persons legitimately in the building will have the same <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement as they have hitherto had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister would be aware of the widespread concern in rural areas about loss of income and violation of the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to export as a result of the ban imposed by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union on live sheep exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This derives from a number of factors: Firstly, its importance to public information, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and expression is crucial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therein lies our basic approach as regards broadcasting planning and policy implementation, expressed in these philosophic terms: That government involvement in Australian broadcasting must be directed to ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise in all forms of communication available to Australian society, particularly radio and television, and that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is best served by diversity of structures and outlets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we also believe that facilitation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise in broadcasting must be consistent with the onus upon government to make the necessary planning and administrative provisions, to obviate the risk of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise for one sector, or group, being indulged at the expense of others, or of the system as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is mindful of the inherent relationship between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and a free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns them is their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and equality as human beings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they stressed that those freedoms and equalities were not apparent to them under State administration in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could not see any possibility of a State takeover helping them to achieve these freedoms and equalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill does not prevent them from providing those services, so what sort of extra <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and what sort of extra access to self-management do the local communities have as a result of this legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Air superiority is to be given priority in the acquisition of a new fighter because of the fundamental importance of this capability, both for defence against air attack, in ensuring the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of our own operations, and to enable our surface attack aircraft to operate effectively against an enemy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the policies- policies of assimilation, policies of restriction and policies designed to prevent the Aboriginal people from establishing a clearer sense of cultural identity and the achievement of land rights, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence; those things which importantly go with acquisition of land and land rights, but more importantly for Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Staley)  mentioned in his statement that government involvement in Australian broadcasting must be directed to ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise in all forms of communication available to Australian society, particularly radio and television, and that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is best served by diversity of structures and outlets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One cannot assume that giving licences to the commercial stations, as was the case until the Labor Party came to power, was enough to guarantee that there would be the diversity or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression which is inherent in the whole concept of broadcasting and the needs of the community and the fact that broadcasting has to be controlled in some way, because otherwise we get mayhem on the air waves and no one hears anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister acknowledged that if one is to be mindful of the inherent relationship between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and a free society’ one has to acknowledge that the best way this can be nurtured is by encouraging wherever possible public consultation in the actual planning process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Also the Minister reminds us of the critical importance of broadcasting, of the control of broadcasting and of the general development of broadcasting policy to a nation such as ours where we value <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, and protect that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the first worries is that the notion of free enterprise is smuggled into the Minister’s key statement on his basic approach, even though I believe it can be argued that in many cases a commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of enterprise is a commitment to two principles which may prove incompatible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is necessary to have an industrial inspector, a health inspector or any other kind of authority to monitor and restrain the activities of a corporate body, surely the least we can do is to give that authority the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that is extended to industrial inspectors and other authorities who have a responsibility, by virtue of their public position, not to disclose information irresponsibly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The outlook for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is based on the problems the country is facing, the way the government and people are reacting to these problems, and the longer run political traditions of the society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means they would effectively prevent those people in our community who do not believe in the payment of medical benefits for the termination of pregnancy from being given the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to opt out of it or to gain membership of a scheme that gives them that option, which I believe they have every right to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would be interested to know whether such people as  Mr Stewart, Mr Keating, Mr Martin  or even  Mr Les  McMahon would be completely in favour of a scheme which prevented a significant percentage of the Australian population from having the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the right to opt out through private health insurance of the payment for a medical benefit or rebate for the termination of pregnancy when they on moral grounds do not believe in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I only hope that the Australian population at large will become aware of the attitude taken by the Labor Party in denying that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to a very significant percentage of the population which is very upset by the fact that at present it is forced to pay through the private health insurance funds for the termination of pregnancies which it on moral grounds cannot support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that for 30 years that nation struggled for its independence and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, that it fought first against the French, then the Japanese and then the Americans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Vietnam is a country which is striving to maintain its independence and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from all sides whether it be China or the Soviet Union on the one hand or the United States on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to his AttorneyGeneral’s statement in relation to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation in which he said that reports of committees and bodies outside the departmental structure would be available for public access when those committees make recommendations to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780927_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s statement does raise some serious and, we would say, possibly contentious questions which we can enumerate as follows: Firstly, public accountability of government in all of” its areas; secondly, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information; thirdly, the rights of public servants; fourthly, Crown privilege; and fifthly, parliamentary privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the range of matters which are considered to fall within the concept of privilege- they are enumerated in guideline 19- are very wide indeed, particularly in relation to the proposed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of our commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, it is our view that Crown privilege should be either abolished or at least seriously redefined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the Government has introduced the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, which has been severely and properly criticised by people outside this Parliament, as well as by the Opposition within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the Government will reconsider the whole subject of Crown privilege in terms of what may happen to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill, which has now been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We note that it will be some two or three months before the Government finalises its deliberations in this matter and we are very concerned to note that at that stage, perhaps, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation still will not have been released by the Senate Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to raise a specific matter but the method by which staffing is arrived at, the manner in which staff is allocated and the effect that the ability of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  or the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to place ceilings on that staff has on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Parliament to carry out its function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistently with the spirit of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which is currently before the Senate and the Government’s policy on access to official information, the Bill repeals the official secrecy provision contained in section 3 1 of the principal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has noted that the Shah has promised that the military administration will be an interim measure and that he has reaffirmed his commitment to the holding of free and fair elections, social justice and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from repression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These could imply a need for government interference in media activities and thereby diminish the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the media to operate in a way which we consider absolutely essential to the very basis of a free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we have to look at the social cost of that kind of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, at the whole problem of competitive advertising and at the whole problem of reading the fine print. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781108_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the Government’s policy in relation to the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly and the right to dissent from an official ruling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister examine all relevant Commonwealth laws to determine whether any rights and freedoms conferred on any citizen by those laws will prevail over any attempted subtraction from the citizen’s right to personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly by the laws of the State of Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking, the Commonwealth does not have constitutional power in the area of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly over any such laws that are passed by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is for each State to pass its own laws either to preserve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly or to detract from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Treasury, through its taxation system; the Department of Social Security, through its income support system; the Department of Education, through its responsibility to maintain <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in education; the Department of Health; the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; the Attorney-General’s Department; the Department of Veteran’s Affairs; and the department responsible for housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in keeping with the notion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information to which this Government has given attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I am perturbed that a responsible industrial organisation- an organisation which ardently believes in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and the rights of the media to report without fear or favour- should take action aimed not at the Government but at the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voluntary efforts like the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> From Hunger Campaign are of the utmost importance in getting people involved in the issue in a personal way, but only governments and large scale commercial activity can come up with the resources on the necessary scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781115_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, of course, it is true that in Tasmania, where there is complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from brucellosis and tuberculosis, that State should have an advantage of trading internationally, which advantage perhaps is not enjoyed to the same degree by other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781117_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Remembrance Day 1978 a small section of the Australian community but an influential section of the Australian community not only chose to forget those who are fighting for basic human rights in the Soviet Union, but they callously turned their backs on those <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters in the Soviet Union, the modernday martyrs of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781123_reps_31_hor112/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we accept the right to life of the unborn and the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the mother, we have a real dilemma if we accept, as I do, the concept of foetal life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790321_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Equally it is occurring at a time when Australia’s economic development is increasingly being dominated by the operation of transnational companies whose size, economic strength, ownership of technology and resources give them more naked economic power than that of many nation states, with a capacity not merely to dominate the market place but also to destroy the myth of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the market place- a myth much beloved by this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is no doubt due to the lack of comprehension that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and thus <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of productive action are part of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and is an absence rather than a presence- an absence of governmental constraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since taking office in 1975, this Government has been very active in passing a series of measures which restrict or reduce the economic and political <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, restrict the legitimate action of trade unions, suppress information or access to information and limit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of travel to and from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Well, for too long the FBI went down the line of its own improvised rules, as we can horribly see, once the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act made it possible for you and me, the ordinary citizen, to go to government files, including the files of the FBI, and read anything and everything which had been kept under wraps as confidential government information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Home Affairs  (Mr Ellicott)  what safeguards are contained within the provisions of this Bill, what mechanisms are provided for in the Bill, and what criteria are laid down that will obviate the possibility of something like the Seberg case happening in Australia in the absence of a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ask: If such substantial funds are to be transferred for that purpose, what then becomes of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action of the ABC commissioners to determine what they think is the best programming for Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if money is to be taken away from the ABC it cannot be said at the same time that the ABC has the same degree of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as it has had before to produce programs and determine its own priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An essential condition for this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is the possession of the material and social requisites for self fulfilment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The apparent intention of the Federal Government, however, to deny unemployment benefits in the future to workers stood down as a result of a strike if the union to which they belong does not condemn the strike is a threat to the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opinion, a denial of justice to taxpayers, and a perversion of the conventional definition of what constitutes unemployment <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other amendments that we will move will provide for all hearings of the Commission to be in public unless there is justification for a private hearing under the principles contained in the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791023_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that we believe in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to bring down decisions, and that all concerned should abide by the decisions of that tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that in Canberra that night he had met with the Council of the Yarrabah reserve and had had further discussions on their request that he negotiate with the Queensland Government for secure land tenure over the Yarrabah reserve and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to manage the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that privilege, as we understand it in its strict sense, is vital to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Such inquiries in almost all cases would bring to the attention of the Australian people, at least temporarily, the extent to which civil liberties and the rights of people to act freely and to practise <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as they believe in it exists throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The participating states will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms including the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within this framework the participating states will recognise and respect the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to profess and practise, alone or in community with others, religion or belief acting in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This report should be read by all people interested in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and by those who seek to understand how society operates in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia but we were biased in favour of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, in favour of a pluralist type society and in favour of a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is important to have democratic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people had democratic freedoms, the nationality questions would be resolved in a democratic manner inside the United Soviet Socialist Republics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those of us who have been interested in the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the question of human rights in the Soviet Union and in other countries know- the report emphasises it in its first conclusions- that there have been positive changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is obvious to honourable members on both sides of the Parliament, having come from the kind of society in which we live, that there are other freedoms which often transcend that, including the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also organisations such as <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> House in the United States- I am not sure about its objectivity but it produces a lot of information about publicising these matters- the International Commission of Jurists, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The collateral obligation to this privilege of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in the Parliament and the essential complementary privileges of the House will be challenged unless all members exercise the most stringent responsibility in relation to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That looks as though we are getting a little <span class="highlight">freedom</span> at last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that we may find that the Parliament says: ‘We give away our chance to ventilate important matters that involve policy matters, not just the liberty and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals who may or may not be charged’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a need to assist schools in exercising responsibility; to maximise the educational effectiveness of the broader <span class="highlight">freedom</span> they now have to make significant educational decisions; and to evolve a new pattern of relationships between school and system consistent with that greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and with the political responsibility of system authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should never lose sight of it because if we lose sight of it we inject some degree of peril to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of our society and we tend to shore up a more authoritarian quality in the way in which certain services are provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we could ever be fierce enough in the defence of our freedoms and of the standards which we require to ensure that the systems of authority within our community are answerable; even at times of crisis, they can be made accountable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we do not have a <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act we have to rely on leaks to the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that home owners will lose the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose to be insured by a successful government-owned insurance corporation which is required to charge the lowest possible premium rates, having regard to the need to secure sufficient revenue to meet expenditure to pay the Commonwealth a reasonable return on capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a natural person or corporation wishes to acquire control of a company by making a general offer to acquire all the shares, or a proportion sufficient to enable him to exercise voting control, limitations should be placed on his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action so far as is necessary to ensure: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although varying views have been expressed as to the extent to which the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of bidders should be controlled, the new code seeks to close loopholes in the present legislation and to improve the effectiveness of the existing controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue involves <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, free elections and equal suffrage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case, it is difficult to see how he can extricate himself from Salisbury, or how Rhodesia can proceed through elections to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and legitimacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The worst way, the method adopted in this Bill, is to destroy the AUS, to make it less representative by interfering with the tradition of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and to prohibit the councils of tertiary institutions from enabling fees to be paid except for very narrow- one might say, almost selfishpurposes confined to ‘student welfare’, narrowly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation seeks to safeguard the very important principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and, equally important, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of non-association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, we have a legislative package which I believe takes a very small step along the important road of providing for the introduction of the principles of voluntary association and academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the principles of voluntary association; simply that means the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to join or not to join. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to pay money to an organisation one supports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Union of Students or any other organisation, but this legislation goes one step further in that it provides for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> not to join and not to pay that money, and importantly, not to be penalised for that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I find it absolutely incredible, when we are talking about such basic freedoms, that we are encountering the opposition that we have had this afternoon and that we had in the chamber only last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>In any case these measures were not intended to apply to independent resellers, so that they would continue to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to negotiate with suppliers for supply on the best terms available from time to time and thereby preserve the beneficial effects on competition provided by independent resellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-45">[More…]</a></li>
