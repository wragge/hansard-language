<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ls it a fact that academic freedom has, in some instances, become academic licence in our universities, with some members of the university staffs overstepping their basic function of teaching by taking part in political activity and, in the process, inciting students to disregard <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government regard these incidents as a form of intimidation and threat to effective <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 can fully appreciate the argument advanced by  Senator Wright  as to clause 4 being within die <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ambit of the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, I suspect there are some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters involved hut I think it is a fair question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter, is that we now have a new Prime Minister who was elected strictly in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions of the Parliament and of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will not oppose this motion because it is obvious that certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes will need time to take effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710310_senate_27_s47/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party I would like to say that, being conscious of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> neces sities and processes, we believe that the adjournment of the Senate until next Monday is imperative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710310_senate_27_s47/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A statement by the Minister for External Territories dated 27th April 1971 relating to Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do  1  understand that the Minister is now suggesting that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis is the taxation power rather than the interstate trade and commerce power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth is adopting a policy of forcing certain sections of industry to raise  a  levy on a dubious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis in order to pay for the research work that is conducted in that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis for this Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of regional electorates is dealt with in paragraphs 27 to 30 of the final report of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they become requests to the House of Representatives they come into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> area where the Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government in such a way as to increase the proposed burden or charge on the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of a judgment given yesterday in the Northern Territory by  Mr Justice  Forster relating to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of parliamentary committees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree that this in no way relates to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of Commonwealth parliamentary committees, as suggested in Press reports published today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees, appointed by the Senate on11th June 1970, be fully established: The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the Commonwealth Government has no head of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in regard to which it may legislate on matters of air pollution or water pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which is directed to the Attorney-General refers to reported statements yesterday oy the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth probably has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate on pollution, although he doubted whether anyone would challenge the appropriation of funds for antipollution measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Committee’s emphasis on the urgency of a national approach, will the Attorney-General examine those sections of the Committee’s report which refer to its views on both the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Commonwealth and the Federal concept of the Constitution and let the Senate have his advice in due course? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present the report from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the Death Penalty Abolition Bill i970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that this clause is thrown into considerable doubt from a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The practice has been that Attorneys-General have not been prepared to answer questions on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law following court decisions, but this is a matter for the AttorneyGeneral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, its application has been limited to the prevention and settlement of disputes in an industry in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> meaning of that word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, in light of its consideration of the decision in the firefighters’ case and the particular result that has flowed from that decision in the Australian Capital Territory, the Government sees no reason why the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be restricted in the Territories to dealing with industrial disputes involving only persons who are engaged in an industry in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense of that word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is normal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedure and does not conflict with the philosophy of the Statute of Westminster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has consistently maintained that the initiative for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development should lie with the House of Assembly to which it looks to represent the wishes of the majority of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to impose production quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article IV of the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty provides, inter alia, that ‘Each Party recognises that aggression by means of armed attack in the Treaty Area against any of the Parties or against any State or territory which the Parties by unanimous agreement may hereafter designate, would endanger its own peace and safety, and agrees that it will in that event act to meet the common danger in accordance with its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, does the Government intend inviting local government bodies to take part in future discussions related to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Orders Committee at this stage recommends to the Senate, without prejudice to any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights, that Senate committees be directed to refrain from meeting and transacting business after the forthcoming dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Commonwealth Government continue to use all <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means to persuade the New South Wales Government to close the Centre? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this work was agreed to by the sovereign State of Tasmania in 1967 and is its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility and because the work has been practically completed - to the extent that the resultant enlargement is approximately three-quarters full - is it not ludicrous, purposeless and asinine to conduct an inquiry now into the proposition, which actually is of little concern to the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware that on 22nd February 1973 the then Acting Prime Minister stated that the Commonwealth Government had decided not to seek leave to intervene in the High Court case involving the question of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Tasmanian tobacco tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for consideration and report and that the Committee report to the Senate on or before 1st May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to the order of the Senate, I present the report from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked myself under what particular <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of power this was being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is scheduled to meet in Sydney in the week commencing 3 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that matters of that character are going to be discussed in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the honourable senator is expecting to receive in an answer to an oral question is an interpretation of a proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment which he knows is a foolish thing to seek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether the Government, by seeking the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to deal with prices, thereby intends by the use of the single word ‘prices’ also to secure a power over interest, rents and wages? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator MURPHY (New South WalesAttorneyGeneral) I ask for leave to give contingent notice for tomorrow as follows: That contingent on the receipt of a further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration bill I shall move that standing order 242 be suspended to enable the third reading to be passed without a call of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  give notice that contingent on messages being received from the House of Representatives transmitting the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1973, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill 1973 and the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill 1973 for concurrence,  I  shall move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that, as happened in 1969, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal difficulties are being raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alteration to the Constitution is necessary before the Government can implement its plan, and the people are being asked at a referendum whether they believe that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter is involved and I should order a division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will oppose this motion and it will oppose it for the reasons which have been advanced on earlier occasions when these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills have come before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes it so awkward because I was going to mention the fact that this matter was supposed to go before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that whenever Bills for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations have been before the Senate on earlier occasions that practice has been adopted instead of the practice of seeking to remove altogether the obligation for a call of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Government will still have an opportunity, if a second reading should be given to this or any of the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills, to move either that standing order 242 be suspended or, if he feels that the attitude of the Senate on that is quite clear, that standing order 283 be amended in some way so that the obligation of a 3-week delay is reduced to, say, 24 hours or less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is not in the same position as the other 4 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It received very intense consideration by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee from 1956 to 1959 when I endeavoured to have established what I think would be the system advocated by  Mr Justice  Dixon- that is to say, the unitary system, ignoring the division between State and Federal jurisdictions, and having one system of judges to administer the law whether it be State or Federal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, that can be achieved only by a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, and until that amendment is made it is vastly preferable to retain the system operating to date whereby Federal jurisdiction in important fields has been vested in the State supreme courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders, the legislative and general purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs be empowered to consider the clauses of the Family Law Bill 1974 during its consideration of the matter previously referred to it, namely, the law and administration of divorce, custody and family matters; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That whereas our National Anthem ‘God Save The Queen’ is a perpetual reminder of the Monarchy as a major feature of our <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> heritage: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr President, I bring up the report of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory reporting that the Committee has been unable to complete its inquiry into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Northern Territory, and move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no wish to become involved in an argument on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation, except to say that it has been my experience that mostly when an amendment is to be rejected the excuse that is usually used as a last resort is that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem that cannot be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is also the point that specific reference to anything, including housing, in the objectives of the legislation could be used as grounds for challenging its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received a message from the House of Representatives relating to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, accordingly, an occasion of great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance in the history of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It concerns the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review elected democratically by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights, but is the States’ House by which all Australians in their own sovereign states formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources for their mutual benefit and advancement, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that it is within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> competence of the Australian Parliament to take action in respect of some of the matters dealt with in that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that Pensioners transport be made free within the Federation where the Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, to make all Government and Private transport free within the Federation to Pensioners and all other underpriviledged members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we are discussing the proposition that the Australian Labor Party ought to be given 5 representatives at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and the Liberal-Country Party Opposition ought to be given four, therby giving the Labor party the traditional majority which a government usually has on committees of this type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Liberal Movement has already a representative at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to say little in support of my own inclusion in this list of delegates to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another member of the Liberal Movement in that State has been appointed by the State Government as a member of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the amendment to the bill recommended by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights of women who play the traditional role in society will be protected, as will the interests of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the task of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to probe this difference of opinion and to determine where the balance of judgment lies so far as the insurance industry is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my understanding, it was accepted in the House of Representatives by the Opposition as a proper basis upon which representation should go from this Parliament to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is suggesting, for example, that the Government should have nominated as the Opposition’s representatives at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention himself, the other Independent and perhaps a member of the Australian Country Party and that that would have been reasonable and something which ought to have been acceptable to the Opposition, his thought processes are quite extraordinary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lacks the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power to raise loans on behalf of local government and, earlier this year, a referendum to establish that power was unsuccessful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the inclusion in Sub-section 54 (2) of the Family Law Bill of the Clause recommended in paragraph 67 (f) (2) of the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which will allow “any fact or circumstance” to be taken into account when considering maintenance, completely alters the whole concept of specific guidelines as now set out in Section 54, and we oppose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is criticism if one brings in a Bill and does not accept any changes to it; but there is even more criticism if one listens to some of the suggestions that are made and, as in the case of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which examined the clauses of this Bill, if one endeavours to have drafts made incorporating views which seem to be sensible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They relate not only to certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems but also to whether or not a Family Court can provide the service and the facilities for persons who are involved in matrimonial causes with adaptations that the existing State system can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My hope was that the Attorney-General would be prepared to explain why, in contradistinction to the initial attitude he adopted when the first version of this Bill was before the Senate, he has now responded to the suggestion of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and desires to have a Family Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer also to the Treasurer’s assertion at the weekend that the Government would have lawful authority, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sanction and parliamentary approval for everything it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that time will demonstrate that alternative methods which are legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> will be formulated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I lay on the table the minutes of proceedings of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in Sydney from 3 September 1973 to 7 September 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was designed to evade the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, when he says that the means which he will follow to govern without the Appropriation Bills will not be illegal and will not be unconstitutional, what credence or trust can be placed on his words? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the Government states the means by which it proposes to raise the thousands of millions of dollars with which to carry on government, how can one say whether the means will be legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I lay on the table a document entitled  ‘Resolutions Adopted at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, Wrest Point, Hobart-27-29 October 1976’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this question was raised in discussion at the Hobart session of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Attorney-General’s view that if there is to be a proposal for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment it would be desirable for the matter to be taken up formally at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which is scheduled to meet again in Perth later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister indicate whether this can be done by legislative action or is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment required? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that it was a unanimous decision of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak upon this motion to place on record my complete sense of shame at the way the Government is conducting itself in the introduction of legislation of great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> import. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers)  is at the table seeking precedence for Government business so that at 11.10 o’clock on Thursday night after the conclusion of ordinary hours of sitting he can bring in 4 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposal is in accord with a unanimous recommendation that was made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in its 1958 and 1959 reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-I regret that both in the House of Representatives and in this place the Ministers, when introducing the Bill seeking a referendum to alter the Constitution in respect of simultaneous elections, should have said that the proposal was in accordance with the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I report to the Senate that I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt)  nominating senators to be members of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees as follows: <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee-  Senator Button, Senator Devitt  and  Senator James  McClelland; Education and the Arts Committee-  Senator Button, Senator Robertson  and  Senator Ryan;  Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee-  Senator Mcintosh, Senator Primmer  and  Senator Sibraa;  National Resources Committee-  Senator McAuliffe, Senator McLaren  and  Senator Robertson;  Science and the Environment CommitteeSenator Colston,  Senator Melzer  and  Senator Mulvihill;  Social Welfare CommitteeSenator Brown,  Senator Grimes  and  Senator Melzer;  Trade and Commerce CommitteeSenator Cameron,  Senator Coleman  and  Senator Walsh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the South Australian Government, which has a very direct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility regarding all aspects of education, specifically colleges of advanced education, some time ago set up the Anderson Committee of Inquiry into aspects of higher education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and that the Committee report to the Senate as soon as possible but no later than 30 September 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt)  requesting that  Senator James  McClelland be discharged from service on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and nominating  Senator Wheeldon  to be a member in his place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That  Senator James  McClelland be discharged from service on the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and that  Senator Wheeldon,  having been duly nominated in accordance with Standing Order 36aa, be appointed to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add only that this was a matter which was the subject of some discussion by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when it was dealing with the Family Law Bill a couple of years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I present the report on the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972 by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, together with a copy of evidence taken at an in camera meeting of the Committee in relation to the reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Education, by saying that whilst I appreciate that the Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power or formal responsibility regarding educational standards in the state school systems, does the Minister consider that he has any duty, as the Minister responsible for education in the whole country, to see that modern courses such as Man- A course of Study- MACOS- and the Social Education Materials Projects- SEMP- which are professionally designed for and relevant to all Australian schools are used in those schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to do so, we would invite <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge and it would appear that we were endeavouring to acquire land without using the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act and without making provision for just terms being set down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of the threat of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge to a provision of that kind in Commonwealth legislation which would be dealing with Queensland Crown land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the briefest comment: Our objective is to get a law, within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers we have, to enable selfmanagement of these Queensland reserves to take effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to proceed with a Bill about which we had doubts as to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity, I think we would be further away from our objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I want to comment briefly about certain matters raised by  Senator Haines  when she said that the only person who foresaw the problems that can arise in relation to the Senate casual vacancies amendment which was made to the Constitution last year was the South Australian representative of her Party who attended the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst that may be true of those people who were at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, I would draw attention to the fact that members of this chamber very clearly expressed their concern and their reservations in the No case which was published at the time of the referendum last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to make it quite clear that whilst  Senator Haines  was talking about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, there were others in this chamber who were not at the Convention who had reservations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe in and support the view that the representatives who are sent to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention ought to be representatives of the Parliament who are duly elected by both sides of the Parliament to represent our interests in what I believe could become a quite significant quorum and not representatives of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people of the Northern Territory and the Government of the Northern Territory will welcome the expression of goodwill in this motion in the Senate today, lt is fitting that this momentous milestone in political and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in the history of the Northern Territory should be marked with a most acceptable gift from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Federal Government use its power under the 1967 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to take over the administration and funding of the Aurukun and Mornington Island Aboriginal Communities, in view of: (a) the government’s previous undertaking that the two communities should become self-managing, and that no solution to the management dispute would be imposed if unacceptable to the communities; and (b) the communities’ clearly expressed rejection of the present arrangements, and the Queensland government’s failure to provide genuine self-management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received a letter from the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Carrick,  requesting that  Senator Chaney  be discharged from further attendance on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and nominating  Senator Hamer  to be a member of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That  Senator Chaney  be discharged from further attendance on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and that  Senator Hamer,  having been duly nominated in accordance with Standing Order 36AA, be appointed a member of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which looked into this matter, found it to be of considerable importance and a subject in which there was a lot of public interest despite the fact, as  Senator Button  said on a previous occasion, that it appeared to be a very dull subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been said already on this report by the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs,  Senator Missen,  admirably dealt with the contents of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been advised subsequently that because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations on amendments to financial Bills- I wondered previously whether this was the case- it is probable that an amendment to delete clause 4 would not be in order because it would entail the expenditure of more money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was trying to say that a member of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs can have no view of his own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, a reasonable analysis of what he said to the Senate is that although he is a member of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to which this Bill is being referred his mind has been made up already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has recommended the circumstances in which this should happen and I mentioned that in my speech tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee recommendations would have been entirely against the course that  Senator Georges  suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received a letter from the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Carrick,  nominating  Senator Rae  to be a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Delegation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nine amending bills are necessary because sales tax is imposed by nine separate acts in order to meet the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that an act imposing taxation shall deal with only one subject of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not mind whether it is referred to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, so long as it is referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I lay on the table a document entitled ‘ Resolutions Adopted at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, Parliament House, Perth, 26 to 28 July 1 978 ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Attorney-General consulted with the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Advancement regarding the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and legal propriety of the arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the Standing Orders bc suspended as would prevent  Senator Button  moving an amendment to the motion for the third reading of the Bills to refer the Bills to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present a report from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on reforming the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That’, insert the following: ‘the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill 1979 be referred to the Senate Standing Commitee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As Chairman of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- the Committee to which it is suggested that such a reference should be sent- I think that I should say, in the shortest possible way, that no suggestion has been put to the Committee that it should accept such a reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill 1979 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that I was making on petroleum products under the estimates for the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs is that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to exercise price control at the Commonwealth level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- I understand that  Senator Tate  was concerned to find out the present position with respect to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the priority of Crown debts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee does recommend, however, that the matter of statutory provisions imposing the burden of proof upon defendants in criminal cases be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is a Committee of this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would mention the point that this Senate ought to consider forwarding the request from the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and await its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then mentioned that it was his advice, and the advice of his advisers that the Bill was <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was addressing my remarks to the constitutionality situation in the first instance before I come to the second point, namely, the date on which this Bill will be presented to the GovernorGeneral for his royal assent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Justice  Kirby said that the legislation was setting out to destroy the independence of the Commission and that as far as he was concerned it was probably unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unquestionably, because on one side of the fence the Attorney-General and his advisers are telling the Parliament that their advice is that the Bill is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s view is that it ought to remain in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to make a statement concerning the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: The provision of legal aid services in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of  Senator Durack,  I seek leave to make a statement concerning the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on scrutiny of Bills and delegation of parliamentary authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arguments against conclusive certificates in fields such as this were set out very persuasively in the report of the Senate’s <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee on freedom of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the Parliamentary recess there were Ministerial discussions in Canberra with the Territory Select Committee for <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development which were helpful to both sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the recommendations of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development set up by the first House of Assembly the Papua and New Guinea Act was amended in May 1968 to provide for further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes to be put into effect later this year are now under examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Important or major changes in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements for Papua and New Guinea of the sort that might be expected to require substantial amendment to the Act should in the Government’s view await consideration by the Territory House of Assembly of the report of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development so that such substantial amendment of the Act would be decided upon in the light of the views of the Territory people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I think the Parliament had every right to expect that it would be comprehensive because Parliament has not sat, apart from one day which was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> necessity, for approximately 5 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to go further and state in the most categorical terms that I believe the present Minister for Primary Industry and his counterparts in the States must share equally a large amount of blame for the problems and the difficulties in which the industry presently finds itself because the Ministers, both Federal and State, although holding the authority - the legislative power, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power - to take effective action to deal with this problem, did not exercise that power but preferred to say to the industrial organisation: ‘You have a look at this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator has raised a nice point of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> argument that we might dispute forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provided some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sanction for the Commonwealth Government to enter the field and to aid the States in the problems presented by the Aboriginal people in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Wentworth)  in another place the other day made the amazing statement that he would do everything he could within the limited <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power that he had to see that the interests of Aboriginals were properly preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why we want to give the Commonwealth this temporary authority, but we want it written irrevocably into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the Commonwealth that we can take action when an emergency such as this arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would take a long time for competent legal men to argue whether the Commonwealth Government had any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power over Australian coastal waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> requirements’ meant that it had to be carried by a majority of growers in each of the mainland States before it could be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the desirability and feasibility of establishing a securities and exchange commission by the Commonwealth either alone or in co-operation with the States and the powers and functions necessary for such a commission to enable it to act speedily and efficiently against manipulation of prices, insider trading and such other improper or injurious practices as the Committee finds have occurred or may occur in relation to shares and other securities of public companies, and to recommend generally in regard to the foregoing such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of legislative power in Australia, enable the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, even with the present limited scope of the companies legislation, there should be established 1 body either under Commonwealth law if this is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or by co-operation of Commonwealth and States, which is certainly <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not trouble the Senate with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> methods which will no doubt be considered by the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee will consider the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legislative powers of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those will be very material matters for any committee to consider as to the appropriateness now of establishing a federal securities and exchange commission, firstly having regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power that derives from our Constitution; secondly, having regard to the opportunities of State authorities who have hitherto administered the company law and under whose general jurisdiction slock exchanges have operated; and thirdly, whether their displacement by a federal commission would have advantages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proliferation of hire purchase companies outside the banking system and the absence of any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> control to any major degree - companies able to offer high rates of interest which have attracted the investing public with consequences which in some cases have been disastrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Realising that the contemplated investigation by the committee will be only into the desirability and feasibility of doing certain things relating to the control of share dealings and that the words ‘feasibility’ and desirability’ no doubt bear a connotation which contemplates <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ability, political opportunity and desirability in the sense of co-ordination of authorities, the Democratic Labor Party is of the opinion that at this stage such a committee is appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has heard the question raised of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion also provides that the committee should recommend generally in regard to these matters such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of legislative power in Australia, enable the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever course <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in the Territory may take, the Government proposes to ensure that those expatriate public servants who are working in the Territory under arrangements made by the Government for providing help to the Territory will not have their remuneration or conditions of service changed unless such changes are decided upon or accepted by the Australian Government, the only exception being any changes resulting from proceedings before the Public Service Arbitrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States of America there is not a total exclusion of the conduct of foreign affairs between the  President  and the Congress because there are inside the Congress, and particularly in the Senate of the United States of America, certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprieties which the Senate particularly is charged with observing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Senate in Washington moves into the area of presidential powers by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety which it has to observe with its power over the appointments of ambassadors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the United States Senate has a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> entry into the area of foreign affairs and defence through its own placita, if I may use an Australian word in the context of the American Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes now proposed are the direct result of your Committee’s Canberra talks and reflect the importance that the Commonwealth Government places on the work of your Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is now reviewing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position that has been reached and will probably propose further talks with the Commonwealth Government later in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform to ensure that this Council is completely representative of the people of the Territory; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we sometimes hear from honourable senators opposite that we should go all the way with LBJ and how we ought to imitate the American alliance, one of the things I do wish they would try to imitate from the United States is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees to people’s freedom of action and the refusal to smear people which is engaged in by people like  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Rae. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience in Australia and overseas has shown that drafting abilities are not likely to be developed unless the person concerned has a first-class knowledge of the law; in the Commonwealth field, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law is especially important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the great credit of the devoted members of this service that over the years the task has been performed with such considerable success and that the Commonwealth statutes in their drafting are eminent among similar statutes and drafting in all countries which follow the British parliamentary and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700423_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (3) The Governments of Pakistan, the Republic of Indonesia, the Republic of Viet-Nam and Cambodia were established in accordance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was raised by him - if not, 1 apologise to him - and subsequently by somebody else about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue and asking whether a subsidy could or could not be granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> expert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Committee of both Houses should be appointed to investigate the raising and distribution of revenue, to ensure that the Commonwealth and States be able to discharge properly their <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we suggest that a joint select committee of both Houses should be appointed to investigate the raising and distribution of revenue, to ensure that the Commonwealth and States may be able to discharge properly their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions, and naturally we suggest that this resolution should be communicated by message to another place with a request that that House agree to the Senate’s proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I believe that the idea of having a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> inquiry with a notion of changing our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights will never, or not in our time, be successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate is of opinion that a Joint Select Committee of both Houses should be appointed to investigate the raising and distribution of revenue, to ensure that the Commonwealth and States be able to discharge properly their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the division of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities the assessment, development and control of water resources in the States is primarily a matter for the State Governments, and the programmes of water conservation being undertaken by the States bear ample testimony to their recognition of the need to develop and make available as much water as possible for use in rural areas as well as in towns and cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, a standing committee on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal affairs has been proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would suggest that if  Senator Murphy’s  proposal for a wide ranging standing committee on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal affairs were to be accepted- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another exemplar of the unsatisfactory condition which can emerge from day to day, month to month and year to year as the States set about their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> task and responsibility of developing the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700609_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority has also received attention and evidence submitted to the Committee tended to establish that the Commonwealth has, through a coalescence of powers in the fields of taxation, defence, external affairs and other areas, sufficient legislative competence to establish a national approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put that forthrightly and without qualification would be to take a stand which ignored what are the plain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Geoffrey Sawer, an acknowledged <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority, said the problem could easily be overcome by the Commonwealth’s making a grant for this purpose, it being the chief moneyraising agent in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Accordingly, when the High Court decision in the Hamersley case cast doubts on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the receipts duty legislation of the States in its application to certain types of receipts, the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  indicated last September that the Commonwealth would see that the States did not lose revenue in 1969-70 in the event that this doubt was confirmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700612_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, to long as I am a member of the Government I am bound by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle that the Ministry acts as one unit for the purpose of strong government in putting before the Parliament its final decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we turn to  Senator Keeffe’s  proposed amendment we should direct ourselves briefly to the point that is made in the second reading speech to the effect that in the division of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility the assessment, development and control of water resources in the States is primarily a matter for State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the success of the Authority is not doubted, but it is doubtful whether, when it delved into further work, that work has been done under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole trouble seems to be that the Labor Party d’oes not understand that the Slates have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us look at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis on which this situation has arisen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was well recognised by the High Court in 1907 that the Governor of a State carrying out functions such as those which are conferred upon him by section 15 of the Constitution, acts as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of the State and can act on the advice of his Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The duty therefore is one of the duties which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of the State owes to the State, and in the case of the Governor but in a slightly different sense to the sovereign, its performance must be enforced in the manner appropriate to the case of such duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sense that unless the State of New South Wales is prepared to exercise a power which it could exercise in 1 of 2 ways it should be a matter for consideration by this Senate as to what course it ought to take to ensure that these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions are observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative view is to ensure that the purposes of the Constitution are observed by proroguing a Parliament which is simply achieved by proclamation and a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation, if this be the interpretation which is relied upon, will then operate, lt should be noted that by a curious coincidence of events the current session of the New South Wales Parliament is a session which apparently began in August of last year ami is still continuing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another action might be - and I think again we could do this without any long debate - to refer the matter to one of the proposed new standing committees, perhaps the one that will be dealing with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Senate’s point of view would be strengthened if it were to point out to the sovereign States that the Senate is a States’ House and part of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> function is to look after the interests of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700617_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that there are different <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions, and there may be some different problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills are a device to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> stipulation that the States ought not to impose duties of excise, and the Commonwealth should not be lending itself to the imposition of such duties on behalf of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that the States requested the Commonwealth to levy this receipts tax because, following the Western Australian case that went to the High Court, it was found that the States did not have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to levy the tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding of that proposition was that it was found that the States did not have sufficient <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to levy a petrol tax, so the Commonwealth took it over and levied it for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third fact was that under the High Court’s judgment it was quite clear that the Commonwealth had the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to impose this taxation whereas the States had not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If possible and if we are asked, we would be prepared to pass validating legislation to enable the States to continue to do what they have been doing in the way of taxation, if they wish to do it, though we do not know whether that validating legislation itself would in fact be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and would stand up to a challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without exaggeration or embellishment it shows on one hand the States faced with the heavy financial obligation to caro’ out their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities, carrying the whole burden of the national debt, and going further and further into debt while the Commonwealth not only gets out of the debt, but builds up vast interest earning investments, paying  all  the cost of Government monetary policy of rising interest rates . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-64-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I am quite correct when  1  say that the Government has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority so to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would be aiming to do something for which there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that with the present committees, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> committees we have, and the involvement of senators now in the estimates committees and standing committees, senators who are not involved in official work of the Senate - such as Ministers, leaders of the Opposition Parties and the Whips - will not be moving to take part in the committee work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#debate-132">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It comes to the Committee which then passes it on to a legal adviser who is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer of very high repute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue would be involved in the gathering of the revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to the second part of the honourable senator’s question, 1 point out that what the States do in relation to price control is a matter within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this process there was one significant parliamentary and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point that was advanced, maintained and sustained, and that was that the House should refer to its appropriate committee a full examination of the problem that apparently arose and caused the Standing Orders Committee of the House to sit and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much as we might like to speak of the independence of the Senate, and it is an independent body in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense, the actual work flow comes from the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partly because the validity of the Trade Practices Tribunal was under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge - a challenge that proved to bc unsucessfu - for three-quarters of the year under review in the Commissioner’s third report, there have been no cases argued before the Trade Practices Tribunal so far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember occasions when the Australian Labor Party in my home State has taken the firmest of stands on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue of whether the lower House has not the power to control money matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the voice of tradition, he strongly attacked the Labor Party’s decision to oppose in the Senate legislation which will give the States their $125m in revenue from the receipt duties tax; it was against <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and ALP tradition,  Mr Calwell  told Caucus last week, for an upper house to interfere with a money Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some time ago the States of Victoria and Western Australia essayed to secure additional revenue by the imposition of a tax which was subsequently held by the High Court to be beyond their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons this tax had to be imposed uniformly in all States, even in those States which had not imposed the tax in that form or at that level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this deceptive, negative document the Government has announced that it is to spend S3 12m on a part of administration which it has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement to finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have developing in Australia in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework a situation which 1 think bodes ill for the nation unless action is taken to consider the stage that we have reached and the remedial action that should be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that arising from this Budget there will be some further consideration of the position of the States in the light of the Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation, and that sooner rather than later we can have some convention or, if not a convention, some investigation, some inquiry in depth, into whether the existing situation is satisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Lighthouses Act was first enacted, it relied in the main on the Commonwealth’s .<span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in relation to lighthouses, lightships, beacons and buoys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee at all times was conscious of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role of the States in regard to this question and that any attempt to solve the problem in the absence of total co-operation and participation by the States could be doomed to failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we closely examined what legislative and administrative steps the States were taking in order to handle, within the limits of their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and financial ability, the problem within the perimeter of the States concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In those other areas where complementary Commonwealth and State action may be required the Committee has visualised that type of approach rather than probing the limits of the constitution to call upon the Commonwealth to exact legal disciplines, perhaps against the will of the States, which may be subject to challenge under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This whole programme could be doomed to failure if it were to resolve into a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> battle between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For  Senator Keeffe’s  benefit, since these questions were asked I sent for  Dr Lane’s  book ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Law’ from the Parliamentary Library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation is consistent with the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the knowledge that it has received a considerable volume of evidence relating to the legal, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and practical problems raised by the issue of where legislative authority lies in the Australian federation in respect of the off-shore waters and sea-bed adjacent to Australia, the Committee considers that a report on its first term of reference would assist parliamentary and public appreciation of that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee therefore has prepared and now presents an interim report on whether the consitutional conception underlying the petroleum submerged lands legislation is consistent wilh the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States have decided, in the national interest, that, ‘ without raising questions concerning, and without derogating ‘ from, their respective <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, they should cooperate for the purpose of ensuring the legal effectiveness of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of those submerged lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be said in the terms of the legal advice which was open to both the States and the Commonwealth in 1962 to 1964 that there was any derogation of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth and the States in the course they followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee does not accept that on the opinions and arguments available and canvassed from 1962 to 1964 the case for the Commonwealth being able to assert <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority over the continental shelf was unquestionable; nor was the Commonwealth’s case for control over the territorial sea-bed one which it was entitled to assume would be judicially upheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee accepts that there was reasonable basis for the Commonwealth and the States to regard the legal uncertainty of their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position as justifying their decision to leave the legal position unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation is inconsistent with what should be the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship between the Parliament and the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the context of broad <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities there is a challenge to the exercise of the functions of Parliament in the conception of uniform legislation drafted by the executive arms of seven Australian Governments being presented to the Parliaments as a fait accompli requiring formal legislative approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This cannot be regarded as strictly inconsistent with the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities’ of the Commonwealth and the Slates as the power always lies with the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the Slates to reject or amend the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee does not regard the legisla tion as being inconsistent with the ‘proper responsibilities’ of the Commonwealth and the States because, as a result of the decision to avoid litigation which would have resolved the matter, it cannot say what is the measure of those proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be apparent to honourable senators from my second reading speech that the Government is drawing to its side additional <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701014_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we speak of international charges we know that companies are involved, but as 1 understand the situation when the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision speaks of people, although the provision does not specify companies as such, it nevertheless would apply to ail persons who might be engaged in that business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Murphy)  raised an interesting <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulty that may lie in the way of this amendment, I thought of this before proposing the amendment and took some advice upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have agreed to refer a consideration of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal position to the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government sits behind the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect of that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The High Court of Australia has held that, as a matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, laws for the government of a territory can operate wherever territorially the authority of the Commonwealth runs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The principal Act touches on some extremely important aspects of the industry, matters of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development as between the Commonwealth and the States and some other very important considerations of the application of the laws of this Commonwealth to citizens in such a way as to have differing applications in different States or territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations on any party seeking to engage in nationalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crux of the matter really is that the High Court of Australia has held that, as a matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, the laws for the government of the Territory can operate wherever territorially the authority of the Commonwealth runs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government bad the Bill, but it said at the time that because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubts about the measure it was necessary for the State parliaments to pass complementary legislation; that is, it was necessary to have similar legislation by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would know even better than I that because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties there is a need for complementary legislation to be passed by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classic or ideal time to impose price control was during the war years when the country was in a state of national emergency and the Commonwealth Government had far greater powers without legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> barriers to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to impose price control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a power has never been envisaged for the Commission and, in any event, the Commonwealth Government could not, for <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> reasons, confer it on the Commission without the approval of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers would have a harvest on this but I invite honourable senators to look at 1 reference in the second reading speech of the Minister for Supply  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reason why the matter has to be presented in that form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the clause is to put right at the forefront of the statute a statement of the objects of this Parliament so as to make the general Act and its objectives conform to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of clause 4 is to confine the objects of the Act to our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite important that we should express our statutes so as to conform with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 4, therefore, is an expression introduced by the Draftsman as to the objects of the Act so as to ensure that the courts will not interpret the Act as an attempt to go beyond the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers that this Parliament has, those powers not enabling us in any way to regulate, prohibit or promote the manufacture of wool within Australia, but being limited to trade and commerce in wool among the Slates and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we limit the objects of the Act to that particular <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> purpose but, of course, indicate under paragraph (g) that it is a function of the Commission, if it thinks it is advantageous to the trade and commerce of wool overseas, to process it in any form that makes it more advantageous to market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to meetthe <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position disclosed by the decision of the High Court of Australia given last June in Worthing v. Rowell and Muston Pty Ltd and Others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some exceptions must be made for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons to the application of State provisions as they stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second was with a number of Australian and Territory lawyers during the recent <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Seminar in Port Moresby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole pattern of what has been happening in the area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Territory this year has been to give to the House of Assembly and to the Administrator’s Executive Council an effective self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The service required of national servicemen is as provided  for in the relevant provisions of the Defence Act and the National Service Act; there are no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions which require action to be taken by the Government of New South Wales to replace a senator in the case of a casual vacancy occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, will he assure the Senate that the case concerning the validity of the Trade Practices Act which is going on appeal to the High Court of Australia will be pursued with all expedition by the Government and not left, as have some other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases concerning important interests, to linger on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In each session the House of Assembly has appointed a Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development has been in operation since June 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House directs the Select Committee On <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development to tour the entire Territory again seeking the true consensus of opinion of people of the Territory on vital issues, especially that of self government, before it tables any further reports of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in this House, and further that this tour should be undertaken early in 1971, and further (hat any future transfers of power or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes, whether requiring amendments to the Papua and New Guinea Act or not, will be unacceptable to the House unless such changes have been agreed to by a majority of members of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On his last trip to the Territory  Mr Whitlam  had a conference with members of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

      <li>The Federal Opposition Leader  (Mr Whitlam)  told Papua-New Guinea’s select committee on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development last night that a Labor Government would not necessarily accept its findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a .second opportunity of expressing their’ will through the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development, which has been for many months visiting .every village and hamlet throughout the Territory of Papua and New Guinea to ascertain’ the wishes and will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  is recorded as having said that a Labor government would not necessarily accept the findings of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Paulus Arek, who is  Chairman  of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development, apparently has some fears, and very rightly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we hear the catch cry of old colonialism,imputing that we are not advancing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure and the economic well-being of this area to the great advan.tage of the local inhabitants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the  chairman  of the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development made a report to the Parliament of New Guinea a few months ago to the effect that in the opinion of the Committee the majority of the peoples of Papua and New Guinea did not wish them to accept independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stalin accepted no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal restraints, and had every instrument of despotism in his hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment there are some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems,, but the Prime Minister has stated clearly that if the Commonwealth is found not to have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power he is prepared to seek that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, on consideration of the President’s report, the Senate might well decide that the viability of that Committee should not receive thai type of priority but that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs or some other committee should be the next to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the cardinal importance to the community of a properly paid and efficient police force, will the Minister consult with the Victorian Government and perhaps consider action under section 96 or whatever may be the correct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision to enable the emergency to be met? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see strong reasons why - apart from the two that have been suggested, which are important, and I do not detract in any way from their importance - we could do with a committee on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it is a legal matter, let us send h to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is a great falling down by the Senate in the performance of its plain duties and in the carrying out of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role if, at this time when all the States are clamouring that they are suffering injustice, there is no action by the Senate to inquire into that subject matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is not much more I want to say, but I think I should refer  to  Senator Murphy’s  comment on the establishment of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, honourable senators will find that if we were to establish a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee those who most appropriately would bc appointed lo it and would gravitate towards it are already extremely heavily are also on other committees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  particularly developed an argument about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee and he spoke about the lawyers attending it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recognise the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> necessity for a rearrangement of Ministerial positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710310_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without canvassing whether it is because of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> argument or point of view which apparently does not apply in all of the States, 1 point out that 1 have heard that the 2 Houses of the Parliament of the State of New South Wales, meeting tomorrow at some time after 4 o’clock - at 4.40 p.m. or something of that order - will appoint a replacement senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adequate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers for such an effort are already available to the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#debate-89">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We even went so far as to refer to the matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority, because in our view this was a very important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the  7  committees in the system which we have proposed, the most appropriate might have been the Standing Committee on Social Environment or the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia continues to regard Britain as exercising legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities for the people of Southern Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, unlike Rhodesia, South Africa is an internationally recognised sovereign State which achieved independence by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Commonwealth’s view as well as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710401_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General of South Australia gave Crown law opinion that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligation for the States to carry out the punishment inflicted by a court for breaches of Federal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a Commonwealth obligation I suggest that the responsibility should be thrown on to the Commonwealth Government to take legal action through the High Court for a writ compelling the South Australian Government to honour its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should point out that the Australian Medical Association and the doctors who accept the advice of that Association have a legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right if they choose to exercise it to assert whatever their fees will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> considerations would be involved in any move by the Commonwealth for such control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of that great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority was that the State law in respect to compensation did not run on Commonwealth territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the Government sincerely held this view it would have directed its attention to one of the most glaring gaps in our legal structure - namely, the absence of any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee of the right of freedom of speech of peaceful assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is always assumed that we have these rights, but the fact is that there is no law and ho <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee that we have a right of freedom of speech and a peaceful assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the main theme of the speeches made by members of the Opposition has been the argument that there is a need for some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee of right of assembly and that in some way that right of assembly is being restricted or diminished by the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask, by way of rhetorical question: Why should there be any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee on the right of assembly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not take too much time considering whether there should be some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we proceed from that basis, again I ask: Why do we need a Bill of rights; why do we need some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee; what are the existing problems which have to be overcome? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the mere statement of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees is not necessarily successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that a vote of a certain amount for an item of work or service imposes upon the Executive an obligation to spend that amount of money is unique in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> experience that has come to my knowledge, and I challenge any honourable senator to provide a precedent for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, at the time  of  the next Budget, if the Government is to be castigated on political grounds, not on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal grounds, let us hear any arguments on whether there has been a default in duty on the part of the Government in not spending the whole $10m on the earthworks dam and reducing expenditure on it to $8m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that there is anything illegal or unconstitutional in underspending an appropriation is fantastic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a clear statement by the Commonwealth Parliament that it is a coastal state which has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights over the area of the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710430_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They draw their financial resources from their own capacity to strike a rate and equally, because of responsibility under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions, from State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the Minister’s attention to the fact that, if private legal practitioners are being consulted by this Department - I have no doubt that they are - the Depart* ment has been waiting for some considerable time for information from the crown law officers as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ability of the Department to carry out certain functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if an amount of $322,000- that will be $332,000 if this vote is passed - is to be expended on legal expenses, perhaps some outside people could be used to advise the Department on its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems and so have them settled, because some of the questions have been before the AttorneyGeneral’s Department for more than 2 years without an answer being supplied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Assistant Ministers - I use that term to describe all the persons I have just referred to - are not Ministers of State in the strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense: the Queen’s Ministers of State are, under section 64 of the Constitution, only those members of the Executive Council who are appointed to administer Departments of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because they are not Ministers of State in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense, section 44 of the Constitution precludes the payment of any salary to Assistant Ministers in respect of their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When those who  aTe  interested in the law look at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law in the great collection of United States law, the corpus juris secundum, it states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I repeat that the essential part of his judgment was the reference to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to freedom of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy President, has  Senator Wright  some special <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or other privilege which enables him to go on in this fashion, distracting me while I am addressing the chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As there is no provision in the States Grants Act 1970 to permit deductions to be made from the grants where a State, or its authorities, do not pay payroll tax, it is necessary to include such a provision in order to meet the possibility that the High Court will uphold the challenge by Victoria and South Australia to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of payroll tax in its application to State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part of our report went to the very complex question of the dual responsibility of the Commonwealth and the States in this area of environmental control, that is, the administrative difficulties and more particularly the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The head of a conservation authority - I think a voluntary body - pointed out that because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties the control of the waters of the Darling flowing from one Slate to another was beyond the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ability of either of the States involved and would require attention by some authority beyond the individual States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they wish to debate the parliamentary system in the House of Representatives they can do so, but it is a function and a responsibility of a senator standing in his place here, in the division of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities which clearly exists between the Senate and the House of Representatives, as  Senator Byrne  has mentioned, to ensure that at least some expression of opinion about these Ministers of State should be adduced here in the Senate, and I propose to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It is accepted in the United Kingdom because the Crown performs a positive role in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedures in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not the Crown which is involved in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in Australia today, as it is historically understood in the United Kingdom at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an untramelled uncontrolled power in the House of Representatives which is not subject to any control except by electoral devices and, with some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, it is able to control the electoral devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no objection to supporting this Bill because it is a Bill that originates in the House of Government and if this is the path upon which the House of Government, the House of Representatives, embarks and wishes to proceed, it is all the more important that the Senate which is, I believe, the repository of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in Australia, should make its views known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make my views known as a senator who understands that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprietories of this country can only be maintained by the Senate since the House of Representatives has abdicated its responsibilities because it has not clearly discerned the path upon which it has embarked and has lent itself to the process by which it can achieve this marriage between the central bureaucracy and the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I shall conclude on what I believe to be an elementary lesson in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety as to the function of government of Australia today, namely, that there is in reality no existence of the Crown as we have historically understood it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thank  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack for his tremendous knowledge of the history of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position which he has been outlining to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, as are distinguished members of the Government, but it is my belief, for what it is worth as a small suburban lawyer, that that clause is invalid because it is in breach of section 96 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I still have the doubts which I expressed this afternoon in regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects of clause 5, it is my intention to support this clause and the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also I think a statement in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ questioned whether this Committee is acting within its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and whether the Commonwealth Parliament does have a control over the stock exchanges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the problems which has beset it for 5 years has been the uncertainty as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, and we hope that a great deal of clarity will come into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> field when the High Court delivers its pending judgment - we hope in the very near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> impediment to the introduction of a Bill to make it compulsory that at least SO per cent to 90 per cent of every Ministry be elected by its parliamentary members? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aborigines and the Arts the matters which have been raised by the honourable senator; but I will do so stating now for the information of the honourable senator that the executive role of the Commonwealth in this area is limited very much by its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The developing practice of using industrial Trade Union organisations  to  effect purposes of a political character, not designed to or having the effect of improvingthe industrial conditions of the members of these organisations and not directly and immediately related to industrial issues but for the purpose of affecting political decisions, properly resting within the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth through its elected Parliament and its instrumentalities and thus usurping the functions of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, then, political stoppages and bans of the kind I mentioned amount to trade unions and their officials attempting to ursurp or impede the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Political disputes, disputes against the civil law, or disputes against international law are quite beyond the range of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of this Parliament or the arbitration court and quite beyond the range of any purpose for which industrial organisations were set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue of whether Assistant Ministers should be appointed raises some important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then  Speaker  of the House of Representatives took the view that it was not proper - meaning that it was not <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> - that Parliamentary UnderSecretaries be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can you inform the House,  Mr Speaker,  of the authorities, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or parliamentary, that you consulted to find support for the opinion stated by you in this House about the status  of  Under-Secretaries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apart altogether from the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question as to whether such a position would conflict with the Constitution in the sense that a person who becomes an Assistant Minister would vacate his office, the Opposition disapproves of the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the appropriate course would be to have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question decided separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not accept it because in the view upon which the” Government has acted it is unnecessary to refer this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question as posed by  Senator Murphy  for inquiry by any body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that where a senator’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to sit in this chamber is conferred by the Constitution, the High Court is the appropriate body charged by the Constitution with the duties of interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although he has posed the existence of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem, I feel that it is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem without any weight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been posed by  Senator Murphy  without, I would suggest, due regard to what his leader said in the House of Representatives and in the face of overwhelming opinion that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem with regard to the appointment of Assistant Ministers, parliamentary under-secretaries, parliamentary private secretaries - whatever they may be called - to whom no emoluments are paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, subsequently made a ministerial statement - on 27th August 1952 - in which he made it quite clear that there was no problem in terms of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety in regard to the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My’ colleague, the Treasurer  (Sir Arthur Fadden),  has already stated to the House the view of the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Spicer),  who has advised that in his clear opinion a parliamentary under-secretary does not in law hold an office at all, still less an office of profit under the Crown, and that his appointment is in all respects <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Attorney-General,  Senator Spicer,  and  Sir Robert  Menzies both expressed a clear view that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> impropriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, why should there be any question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> impropriety in the case of Assistant Ministers who receive no salary or emolument but simply receive only out-of-pocket expenses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 440 of Hansard of the House of Representatives for last Friday  Mr Hughes,  the honourable member for Berowra and former Attorney-General, is reported to have said:  there arises no doubt in my mind as to the perfect <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety of this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is years since I looked at this matter on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where then is this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> impropriety? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  gave a positive indication that as far as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprieties were concerned and the righteousness or otherwise of appointing Assistant Ministers, all that the members of the Labor Party were concerned to do was to get a little bit of assistance for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to enter in great detail into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am disturbed that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt and I would like to see it resolved, beyond any reasonable doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General does not seem to think that there is any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to debate the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee may be able to clear up beyond all possible doubt the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may satisfy the Senate that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt at all as to the validity of these appointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sum up by saying that I believe that what is proposed leaves room for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand we have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects of the appointment of Assistant Ministers, and on the other hand we have the practical needs for the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both this afternoon and on Tuesday evening  Senator Willesee  referred to what he described as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubts in respect of the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far back as 1952 one of the most eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers of the land,  Sir Robert  Menzies, the then Prime Minister, backed by his eminent advisers of those days, said that there was no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bar to the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  said here on Tuesday that the need for a reference to any body or authority as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety of establishing the office of Assistant Minister was non-existent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a wealth of eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers who say there is no doubt on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So from the point of view of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> correctness I have no doubt about the appointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has raised <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects about the appointment of Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>who has advised that in his clear opinion a Parliamentary Under-Secretary does not in law hold an office at all, still less an office of profit under the Crown, and that his appointment is in all respects <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>.. With this opinion I entirely agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt about the ability of the Prime Minister to appoint Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view - and I think in the view of certain members on the Government side - there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt as to whether he can appoint Assistant Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government appoints Ministers and Assistant Ministers whenever it feels like doing so, without <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority, it will be doing exactly what the editorial in today’s newspaper stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect of the amendment and as one who was here when Assistant Ministers were appointed quite some years ago - I rely on my memory - I feel that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect was adequately cleared up at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To fill these gaps, and as an interim or holding measure, the Government proposes to introduce legislation to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects that were found to exist in the present Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This holding legislation will be substantially the same as the existing Trade Practices Act save for the amendments required by a consideration of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects attributed to it by the High Court’s judgment and the availability of the corporations power contained in section 51 (xx) of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For far too long there has been this no-man’s land in the law, in relation to which it has been said that however important legislation of an economic and social character might be, or however desirable it is in the public interest, it was not possible for it to be enacted by this Commonwealth Parliament because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To a very great extent those <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties have now been clarified and it is apparent that there is a great sphere for action by the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment has opened up tremendous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> vistas which no doubt will be exploited - certainly explored - in the years that are to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an historic judgment - because it sets out the principle which is to be followed by courts in opening these new <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> horizons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation is the same as that with which we have been long familiar with the common law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is a very different thing from setting out to decide at one blow the full ambit of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How that will be used is now only a matter of speculation, but I do think that the Senate can come to the conclusion that the judgment opens a new era in Australian consti tutional history, perhaps-in Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relations - between the Commonwealth and the States, and as to the possibilities that now present themselves for the development of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as we move further from the time of the actual setting down of the Constitution, and as there is a consistent and persistent refusal to re-look at the Constitution by way of referenda or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment of some kind or another, more and more the area of power is moving from this Parliament into judicial tribunals, and it was left to the High Court to make this very big advance for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in my view this highlights the need for the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee to be reactivated and for the recommendations of that Committee to find at least discussion and perhaps acceptance in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is a good thing that such powers should be left to reside in the High Court due to the failure of the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes to operate and give viability to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Concrete Pipes case is a landmark in legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history,
          and I know that the lawyers will be fascinated to see how much more power the
          Commonwealth has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That
          Parliament, in the time I served in it, had not come to terms in any way with the
          reforms that obviously 8 September 1971 are required in a parliament in this day and age
          in order to make it a meaningful institution and to enable it to perform the
          <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and historic role it has evolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to some of the events which have occurred in the last few days and which are a clear indication of where the Government has fallen down and of the inability of senior Ministers to uphold the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for Civil Aviation inform the Parliament whether it is a fact that the 2 major Australian airlines persist with parallel timetables because neither the Department of Civil Aviation nor the Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal power to compel the airlines to alter their timetables? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that anybody seriously approaching the question of the recommendations made by the Senate Committee would be concerned to ascertain whether or not the Committee’s suggestions in relation to this matter* were valid under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls that an opinion of the Commonwealth’s legal advisers or is that an assumption based upon some consideration which has not extended to the same sort of consideration as was given, for instance, by the Senate Committee which had evidence before it from top <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers in Australia whose views were taken into account at the time those recommendations were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget has a total expenditure of just under $9,000m, of which just under $3,000m is allocated to the States for the performance by them of their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the concern of the States at this developing situation the High Court, on the occasion on which resort has been made to it, has clearly indicated the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Commonwealth’s superior position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue which was litigated before the Supreme Court did not relate to Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power but to the powers of the Northern Territory Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 received applications from a number of people; those applications were referred to the Governor-General, and the GovernorGeneral, acting in accordance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety, declined to order the release of the persons concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the honourable senator is aware of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in this country, namely, that the decisions made by the Governor-General are made on the advice of his Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, has the Minister read  Mr Dawson’s  opinion that this is, for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons, a problem which is probably more appropriately the responsibility of the Commonwealth than of the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That’, and insert: the Bill  be  referred  to  the Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible after the appointment of members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The significance of the transfer to the States is that they do have within their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority this growth tax which they may now levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the following legislative and general purpose standing committees appointed by the Senate on 11th June 1970, be fully establishedForeign Affairs and Defence; <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs; and Finance and Government Operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise to say a few words on this subject, not so much because I wish to support  Senator Cant  in his application to the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  to have this matter removed into the High Court for a determination of the legal problem that it presents - I agree entirely that it does raise in a very real way some of the grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems that are facing the Federal and State governments in relation to the control of the seabed and all that that entails - but because I believe that this matter raises another problem altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 take this opportunity, as the matter has been raised tonight, to draw the Commonwealth Government’s attention to this problem, not only from the legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point of view but also from the point of view of the need for adequate protection of these wrecks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties so bedevilled all those who worked in the field, and the mainland States showed insufficient interest to underpin an export scheme, that a little more than 3 or 4 years ago purposeful units of the Tasmanian industry waited upon the Department of Primary Industry and received great assistance from the then Secretary,  Mr Maiden,  whose contribution to the origin of this scheme I acknowledge tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge too the untiring work, over the years that have intervened, of the Tasmanian State Fruit Board; the members of the Australian Apple and Pear Board; the most earnest and skilful officers of the Department of Primary Industry and the untiring efforts of my colleagues, first,  Sir John  McEwen, then  Mr Anthony  and now  Mr Sinclair,  which have resulted in the stabilisation scheme now before us which has surmounted all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties that bedevilled us for 15 years - the uniformity required by the Constitution for bounties; the non-discrimination between trade benefits required by the Constitution, and the offsetting of section 92 which in this case docs not really offer any obstacle when the exporting States are Tasmania and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Death Penalty Abolition Bill 1970 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible after the appointment of the members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Towards the conclusion of the lime allotted for the discussion of the Bill I sought leave to have it referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which is one of the standing committees of the Senate, with a view to having that Committee inquire into the Bill and report to the Senate as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Death Penally Abolition Bill 1970 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible after the appointment of the members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it should also be indicated that in the intervening period the membership of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has been constituted and there is now a committee to which this measure could bc referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight we heard the AttorneyGeneral saying that the Bill should be sent to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time the remainder of these standing committees, including this one on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal affairs, have been set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that, as with other Bills, this Bill ought to pass the second reading stage and then go to the Committee stage, whether it be dealt with by the Committee of the Whole or by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Death Penalty Abolition Bill 1970 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  has moved an amendment to  Senator Greenwood’s  motion that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects that were found to exist in the Trade Practices Act in that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my statement of 7 th September I pointed out that the High Court had held that, due to the way in which the Trade Practices Act sought to use all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers believed to be available to sustain the legislation, it was open to legal objection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from minor drafting changes, and the inclusion of some transitional provisions, the provisions of the Bill differ from the existing Act only to the extent that is necessary to remedy the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill accordingly authorises the Commissioner to retain documents he has obtained from other persons so long as the documents can be related to a relevant head of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be appropriate for me to express a view on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711026_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position regarding votes taken in that body of countries failing to meet their membership obligations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, while membership was retained a member whose subscriptions were in default would not be disqualified from voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While an answer to a question without notice is not the occasion on which to express an opinion on legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues, it does appear to me that the honourable senator’s suggestion of a lower rate of duty on aviation fuel used on flights to and from Tasmania would constitute discrimination between the States on a law relating to taxation, lt would therefore be beyond the Commonwealth’s powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also conscious of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By passage of a motion to refer the Death Penalty Abolition Bill to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, the Government avoided an expression of opinion by the Senate on that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood said that this Bill is being introduced to meet the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements following the High Court judgment in the concrete pipes cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this matter,  Mr Connor,  my colleague in the other place, has  Observed  that the portion of the old Trade Practices Act of undoubted <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity - perhaps 1 should not say ‘of undoubted <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity’ in view of the remarks of one of the learned judges of the High Court; I might observe that they were of generally undoubted <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity - related to overseas shipping conferences and their agreements with Australian exporters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, as stated by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood)  and as has been adverted to by other honourable senators, is merely a holding measure made necessary by the application of the High Court to the previous Act in which the High Court discovered <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> informalities which make the passage of this Bill necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regret that its predecessor was found vulnerable to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be agreed among them that the decision of the High Court was expected by lawyers throughout the community who had had anything to do with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had, of course, 2 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenges, and while those challenges were proceeding the work of the Commissioner was inhibited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If what the Attorney-General says is so, my feeling is that we ought to delete the clause from the Bill because the High Court has said that the Australian Industries Preservation Act is a valid Act, that it is within the scope of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and that it is an Act that contained wise provisons that, in later times, seemed to have given some promise of protection to the public against various restrictive practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth and it is directed right on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is satisfactory that judges should be used for this task, irrespective of the strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a subject which has been raised as a matter of strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety before the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This immediately raises a question as to whether or not there might not be some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt as to its efficacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If as the Attorney-General has suggested, without touching the substance of dealing with monopolisation or predatory price fixing, some alteration of the verbiage would make him happier about conforming with any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements, I am sure that the committee could attend to this before the conclusion of the matter or it could be dealt with elsewhere, now that the principle has been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That process has not been available in other company cases because of the limitations of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the re-interpretation of the corporation power, as given by the High Court in the concrete pipes case decision, there is now possibly a vast <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> field available to the Commonwealth Government which has not been explored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the matter would not remain there because it would become a major matter in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This raises a very great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue - I use the word ‘<span class="highlight">constitutional</span>’ in the broad sense - of whether the law should be applicable to every one, whether it should be able to be set in motion by everyone or whether it could be instituted and set in motion only by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that this House of the Parliament cannot propose such an amendment because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, but it can make a request to the other House to amend the Bills accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is now needed is a new code of family law created by a combined effort of the States and Commonwealth so that within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the latter, a new divorce and marriage code may be created, drafted in the context of the new provisions on the subjects within the State sphere, which could be enacted as uniform legislation by the several States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been a sensitive field in the operation of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law in the conferring of power on other judicial bodies and it is one which has come under constant judicial scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is to observe the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister (for External Territories) noted the views of the group and it was agreed that this was a matter for a select committee on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the next House.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position regarding votes taken in that body of countries failing to meet their membership obligations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ANZUS Treaty, as honourable members will know, provides that in the event of an armed attack on any one of them or on their forces in the Pacific area, the United States, Australia and New Zealand would each act to meet the common danger in accordance with its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inherently the States themselves have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody in the Commonwealth field who suggested that the Slates should move away from their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities for local government would not last very long in national politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question has been raised in this community before and a lot of people have threatened to get legal advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If accepted, it would involve a complete alteration of the basis of Federal and State <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities, an important unit of which for the States is that they retain the predominant responsibility and therefore authority with regard to State universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then I need not argue the proposition any longer because it is only because of that grudging agreement to the now express policy of the Australian Labor Party to give some financial support to independent schools that it occurred to  Senator Wheeldon  to waft in this fantastic feathery notion that any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt is raised by reference to section 1 16 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Treasurer also read  Mr Dawson’s  opinion that this is, for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons, a problem which is probably more appropriately the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government than of State Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think one must appreciate that this is u new Department, that Commonwealth responsibility with regard to the environment is a recently accepted responsibility and that the extent of that responsibility is hogtied by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations :Ind ‘here is a very real .limit to the effective work which can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier statements by the Minister have indicated that there is a role of co-ordinating, cooperating and initiating wilh the States, and constitutionally it is very hard to see how any activity apart from that could be exercised by the Commonwealth in the light of the broad Government policy that it desires to co-operate with the Stales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But obviously the States must be circumscribed by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations of their power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It could have recommended the use of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to give ihe Commonwealth an overall disciplinary control of water pollution that would go, perhaps, to pollution of the environment generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I propose to have something to say in due course about the basis of the motion which has been proposed by  Senator Douglas  McClelland, but before doing so I would like to refer to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis upon which the Commonwealth must determine how it is to act with regard to the broad question of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In starting may I say that, in terms of the environment as a subject matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, the Commonwealth has no direct legislative powers whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then went on to acknowledge that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations must be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say, taking what  Senator Byrne  has said as the very basis on which to make worthy comment, that if there is divided authority in the States as to the various bodies which have responsibility in this area it is much more difficult in the Commonwealth area where, lacking the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, it is necessary to look at the incidental work of other bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this area the Commonwealth : is painstakingly building up from grass roots a new department and it is doing so in the face of all the problems of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations under which the Commonwealth labours in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there has been ample opportunity, notwithstanding anything which has been said by the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood),  as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson),  for this Government despite any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which may exist to have taken action and to have shown an awareness of the problem and a keenness to take steps to overcome the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second aspect in relation to which the Commonwealth could take action, notwithstanding any limitations that there may be in relation to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, is the techniques for abatement and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened this evening to the reference by the Attorney-General to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a study of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, legal, social and all the other environmental problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to page 142 of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution, which expressed its view on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has been presented with problems and possible solutions necessarily involving consideration of the distribution of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I suggest to them that they have given inadequate appreciation to the difficulties of a new department in’ a space of less than 6 months in taking the steps which have to be taken in a very difficult, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> area, where there is a multiplication of authorities which have to be resolved and accommodated in some way, it is noi to deny the fact that there is a need for a recognition of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart  from  that,  I  hope that the Senate and the  nation  generally  will  recognise that in areas  of  environmental control a very real problem  is  postulated  by  the Federal Constitution,  The  Government has twin policies,  the first of which is  that in these matters involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties it shall  seek  co-operation through the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators consider the matter they will appreciate that within the federal system, in most of the areas that have been talked about, the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility lies with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  in September last year the Committee presented an interim report on its first term of reference, namely, ‘Whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation is consistent with the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the Slates’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said to me by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and economists that it would be comparatively simple to introduce a Bill to provide for a super tax on incomes over a certain level and that it would be comparatively easy to amend the Income Tax Act to put a limitation on the enormous expense allowances which are enjoyed by those in private industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involves further analysis of legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and existing regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This body must have adequate power, in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this 3-tier system of government I think we accept that it is terribly essential that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities which rest upon the various levels of government - Commonwealth, State and local government - should be adequately and properly discharged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is part of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system in which we have 6 States which are independent bodies within the terms of the Commonwealth Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever action we take in this matter is taken with the greatest regret, but the Parliament would involve itself in an exhibition of contradiction and inconsistency if it did not similarly apply within the area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ability the administrative responsibility available to it and if it did not apply the principle espoused within the last 24 hours in another area of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and administrative responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development was set up way back in June 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its task was to draft a set of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposals as a guide for future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be too great a departure from the present structure of the constitution that we have established for New Guinea following the inquiry by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> committee in that country for us to alter the Bill in the way proposed by the Opposition, that is to say, effectuating the appointment of these 9 Ministers by making the appointment from the Council itself rather than by the Commonwealth Minister for External Territories making the appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power to legislate for such an authority resides in the Stales, it is imperative that States be prepared to bring downthe appropriate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority under its foreign affairs powers to control the movement of materials which are the basis of international agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now Customs officials want a right in an area where the Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development, provide to the people of Papua New Guinea information concerning the nature of government and the systems prevailing throughout the world.It is aimed at helping them to come to their own conclusions as to the form of government they wish to choose for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment and management of national parks and reserves in the States is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of the State Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in answering the honourable senator’s question I should preface the general answer I give by indicating that the question of the area of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in regard to matters of water pollution and air pollution is hedged with much doubt and many problems as to its extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What may have been done under wartime conditions has a different <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> application, I say without developing the matter very much, from what we are confronted with now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of such co-operation, it would be a matter beyond the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of any one authority to get co-ordination and co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there bc referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs the following matter - The Report of the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee, dated August 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for the reference to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs of the report of the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore to some extent, unless honourable senators wish at this stage to expatiate at length on the contents of this very valuable report, 1 do not see any reason why this motion should be laid aside, I suggest that the Senate should allow this report, by resolution, to go forward to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the discussion of this matter might be unexpected and might have taken the Senate by surprise and although very few honourable senators may feel themselves equipped to discuss the matter - more particularly the substantive report - with any particularity, I believe that the Senate could well resolve tonight, not in a casual way but in a brief manner, to refer this report to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, and let the Senate look forward to discussing the report when the Standing Committee’s report comes forward in due course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I do not think that is a justification for simply moving that the particular report be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs without looking at the substance of the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers is the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were following the procedure adopted in the United States, Canada and in other countries we would say to the committee dealing with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal affairs: ‘You will consider all matters of law and justice, bankruptcy, copyright, the Judiciary Act, administrative review matters and so on’, and then leave the committee to deal with the various aspects which were important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs the following matter - The Report of the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee, dated August 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate of what the Leader of the Government  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  said, that this <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee already has 2 quite substantial issues before it to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say that the pressure of work under which the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Legal <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government rejected our proposition on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds and the States turned us down for various reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls the AttorneyGeneral aware of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance of a decision handed down this day in the High Court of Australia while sitting in Melbourne? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This decision opens up for the Commonwealth Parliament new vistas of control of these fringe banking institutions, and a future Labor government will not hesitate to use to the full all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers at its disposal to bring these fringe banking institutions under the supervision which is necessary in the interests of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that where there has been a vacuum of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in the past, such vacuum might now be filled by the decision in the concrete pipes case where the High Court suggested that perhaps the Commonwealth’s corporations power under the Constitution has never been fully explored, much less exploited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ am a member of that Committee and I do not want to anticipate its investigations, but as part of its deliberations there could well be an examination of the possibility of legislative power and the exercise of that power within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power given under the head of corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator James  McClelland mentioned that the concrete pipes case was a notable landmark in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt in due course the matter will be examined, but I am assured by my advisers from the Treasury that it is by no means clear to what extent the recent judgment of the High Court in the concrete pipes case has clarified Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to control financial corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest for the consideration of honourable senators, and of the Minister, that perhaps this might be an appropriate matter for consideration by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Outside the strict law, what we call the legal law, the social law, the municipal law, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law and the criminal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ALP leaders should understand that it is absurd for  a  party which is askingto be elected to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to involve itself in actions and statements which negate the whole basis of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Towards the end of last year, when the debate on that Bill was almost concluded, a motion was moved by the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  to refer this Bill, even before it had passed the second reading stage, to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to which this matter was referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important for the Government Parlies to have the opportunity to consider the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which has been submitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said, firstly, that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has said that the Bil! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unprecedented step was taken of interrupting the second reading debate when it had  Deen  almost concluded and sending the Bill eff to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For good measure  Senator Greenwood  gave notice that he would move for the bill to be referred to the Senate’s standing committee on  legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> affairs - a tactic which can achieve nothing but renewed delay,. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was followed by ‘The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Scope for Indirect State Taxes’, introduced by Professor Geoffrey Sawer of the Australian National University and Professor Castles of Adelaide whom, I must say, I thought was extremely good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not impressed by the proposition - although I am prepared to admit that I could be totally wrong in due course - that this is likely to change very much in the short run of time by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attempts could well be made and, if they are, they might lead to a better understanding but the history of Australian referenda to which I shall refer later is not encouraging to those who seek to find a remedy by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one has to look for other methods of change in this matter and not take rigid positions or do nothing because one postulates that at some time in the future there will be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We discussed the matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, political and economic constraints affecting the evolution of an effective system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I argued, just for myself, that one of the ways in which this problem could be handled would be to give the Commonwealth Grants Commission a higher status, to revive the Federal Co-ordinator of Public Works, to pick up the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Inter-State Commission and to look at managing the situation better, in the resource allocation sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having been intimately involved in CommonwealthState financial relations - as honourable senators will understand, I have been part of it - I want to tell the Senate that the situation will be something like this: The centre will be concerned with expenditure (unctions, intergovernmental co-operation, taxation, grants and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues affecting financial relationships, lt will be detached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was introduced by him against a background of a great deal of topical troubles with Federal-State relationships which related particularly to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arguments about the validity of turnover taxes, problems arising out of the Australian Loan Council and the massive interest and capital indebtedness of States and other matters which were then highly topical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Health been drawn to a statement by the Secretary of the General Practitioners Society,  Dr Arnold,  that his Society has received legal advice that arbitration on general practitioner home visits and surgery consultations is not <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that there are ample <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> powers which might be drawn upon and from which the Government under appropriate legislation could arm itself to deal with the adverse effects of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should be looking to see whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers enable us to set up proper machinery in order to deal wilh a real social problem which affects every person as a consumer, which affects every person as a ratepayer or taxpayer and which affects every person who has an interest in the efficiency and the prosperity of all industry and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether  Senator Lillico  directed his remarks to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety of the reference of the matter to the committee, but, despite what may have been said about the power conferred on Parliament by the decision of the High Court in the concrete pipes case, I refer him to what was said by  Mr Hughes,  a distinguished lawyer and a man who was considered by the Government to be sufficiently equipped to hold the position of Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One always speaks tentatively in the field  of  <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, knowing that decisions in the High Court go sometimes &lt;me way or another way on a very fine balance  of  numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they believe so it is about time that we heard from them.I suggest that these men are sufficiently versed in the law to know that this alibi has disappeared for them, that they can no longer shelter behind the plea of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> inadequacy and that there is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to refer the matter to the committee and for it to recommend, if it thought fit, legislation which would be within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we should let this Parliament, and especially the Senate, indicate to the people, that it is not merely wringing its hands about inflation but, within its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, is examining the problem seriously in an attempt to find an answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be matter that could be referred in detail to the Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Committee, where perhaps the lawyers of the Senate, sitting in the appropriate atmosphere, might examine it in conjunction with a consideration of State codes of evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that if the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs were able to bestir itself a lot of these matters could readily be referred to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another important tribunal of a voluntary nature is meeting in Adelaide, the festival city of this country, next week to deal with matters of major national importance - some of a legal nature and some of what might be described as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The information available to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when it considered this matter was that 2 Bills of opposite intention have been introduced in regard to the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had thought that we might have had an examination of this matter by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs following the vogue of Senate committees inquiring into all sorts of matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That accusation is that the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  was deliberately scheming to keep this Bill from coming before this chamber to reach finality when he recommended and moved that it be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 simply wish to make it abundantly clear to this chamber and to anybody else, who is interested in this matter that it was not at the instigation of the Attorney-General that the matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the substance of the amendment, it may be that what has been put before us by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has been examined by others in full. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The absence of facts and material to enable us to debate this aspect of the matter wilh greater particularity is a disappointing result of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720309_senate_27_s51/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, it needs to be recognised that there  are  <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations  on the  extent to which the Commonwealth is empowered to adopt policies which could be construed as discriminating in favour  of  particular States or parts of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While recognising the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> considerations implicit in the provisions of Standing Order 253, the Committee considers that the procedure could be improved, particularly having inmind the situation which arises when the closure is applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-58-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps part of the strength of the British <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system has lain in the vagueness of the constitution and the indefinite and unspecified rights which, in a crisis, in some way can be discovered and implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720322_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that only 5 per cent preferred gaol was, I am sure, in the light of the other alternatives which were posed and the imposition of which in many respects is not within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate in Committee on that Bill has raised many issues of considerably complexity, and I think it is generally accepted by those senators who have interested themselves in the Bill that there would be benefit if those issues could be considered by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to refer the matter to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs would suggest, as the Minister has stated, that further consideration of the provisions is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They welcomed the proposal which the Attorney has now placed before this chamber that the Bill should be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how long this exclusive body, the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, will take to consider the question, but with the greatest respect I ask whether it is necessary to extend the operation of the Act for 12 months to enable this consideration to be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to fix a date some time in the Budget session, which might be reasonable, in the expectation that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs could work on this Bill in the future remaining weeks of this session plus the interval when the House and the Senate are not sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the policy of the Australian Labor Party is as was suggested in the minority report - its representatives on that committee not only opposed anything being given to the independent schools; they went further and advocated a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge to the right of the Commonwealth to assist independent schools - I think one is justified in coming to the conclusion that its attitude on this matter is entirely opportunistic and is designed entirely for electoral purposes and that if it ever got power over the independent schools it would use that power to drain off their lifeblood and eventually eliminate them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my second reading speech on the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill prior to the Easter recess I indicated that I had in mind moving a motion to the effect that that Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thank  Senator Murphy  for his indication on behalf of the Opposition that it concurs in the Government’s proposal that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for consideration and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be that after the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has examined the matter there will be a different approach when the matter next comes back to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill takes up that theme and reflects the general idea set out in the report and the general idea contained in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> references. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the question should be asked to ensure that the Committee has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority, or to strengthen the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis of the Committee, and it would be advisable for the Committee to be asked to make such recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see that as the only basis of difference between us, and that is very far removed from the problem we are faced with, namely, what I regard as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of responsibilities between this chamber and the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem it is well to remember that in this field the Commonwealth has no power in areas other than the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These events raise very important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions as to the  proper  relations between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Surely this position must suggest to any thinking person who is concerned for the welfare of the 3 levels of government in Australia that the time has arrived, if it has not passed, for a get-together of the 3 elements of government in Australia to attempt to arrive at a proper basis of judgment of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations of those 3 levels and the means which may be found to enable them adequately to discharge their functions in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a number of occasions in the intervening years since  1945  when that decision was made and implemented questions have been raised as to the constitutionality of that decision because of section  99  of the Constitution which concerns itself with the relative position of States and with not giving an advantage to one State over another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I was most interested and intrigued to receive an assurance from people who are concerned with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law that where an Act speaks about States or part of States - I think that is the terminology used - in a serious judgment on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds, this has been held not to refer to States or parts of States within the meaning of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it is inconsistent with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship between Parliament and the Executive Government that the need or justification for the provision of any staff or other facilities for members of Parliament, necessary for the discharge of their parliamentary duties, should be determined by any agency of the Executive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw particular attention to the words ‘in the national interest’ -  that, without raising questions concerning, and without derogating from, their respective <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, they should co-operate for the purpose of ensuring the legal effectiveness of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of those submerged lands: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the Government resolves this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question the position is uncertain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that the new amendment will cure all the ills because the Commonwealth cannot legislate beyond its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I submit that this situation arises out of the dilemma in which the draftsman found himself when the parties to the agreement decided to set aside the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he make representations to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to expedite its consideration of this matter as in many cases justice delayed is justice denied? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to the other part of the honourable senator’s question, I am not sure that I am the best person to approach the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which has, as one of the many matters charged to it, the review of the whole question of divorce, family law and custody in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bills to amend these 2 Acts will make possible the extension of the Commission’s jurisdiction in these 2 Territories to disputes involving persons in employment, whether or not they are in an industry, in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense of that word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s recommendation gave rise to considerable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and practical difficulties in the light of which the Standing Committee decided not to establish a commission of the kind proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its predecessor, the Australian Industries Preservation Act had proved ineffective partly because of difficulties of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, but also because the generality of the terms in which it was expressed had led to great uncertainty as to its application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was intended as legislation to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects disclosed in the concrete pipes case, and to hold the position until the strengthening legislation now proposed could be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s consideration of the provisions to be included in this strengthening legislation has, of course, taken account of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers as disclosed in the concrete pipes decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, provisions relating to mergers, which in 1965 would have been regarded as being of doubtful <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity, are now possible and have been included. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may well be some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties involved in incorporating in legislation some of the proposals that the Minister foreshadowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we see the position, the Bill can be divided into 4 fields: Firstly, matters related to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of unions concerning questions which could, in the case of a number of unions, go to their very existence; secondly, the rights of rank and file unionists within the unions; thirdly, amendments to the structure and procedure of the conciliation and arbitration system; fourthly, the question of sanctions and the responsibility of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to the extent that the Bill does promote measures to assist in preserving unions from the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenges of the Moore v. Doyle case, and to the extent that the Bill gives effect to a number of our views in preserving and promoting the rights of union members within their institutions, we consider that it should not be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government seeks to use legal, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and intimidatory means to prevent the trade union movement carrying out its proper responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that all Australians would recognise that the health plan of the Labor Party would subordinate the doctors to a regimentation which may or may not have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis in a way that the Government’s plan does not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that those who are  in  the legal profession will start to do something to put their house in order before those complaints grow to a torrent Already we have had unanimously passed in mis Senate a motion referring to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs matters of divorce dealing with oppressive costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  work as a member of the High Court over a period of some 35 years, for 12 of which he was Chief Justice, has left an indelible impact on the development of Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the occasion when he was sworn in as Chief Justice he said that the function of the High Court in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters was to interpret a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> description of power or restraint upon power and to determine whether a given measure falls on one side of a line or on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I venture to say,  Mr President,  in the presence of my fellow senators that it was in application of these principles to our own specially important Constitution that the late Chief Justice made his most substantial mark and contributed to the building of a body of doctrine which, in my assessment, will stamp his as an era of exposition superior in importance to the great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> decisions of the Stuart period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last of the four great pillars, as 1 think of his decisions was in the boilermakers’ case in which he insisted that no other arm of government should encumber the judiciary by adding to it non-judicial power, and no other arm of government should detract from the judiciary by weakening or undermining its proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is he in a position to say, in relation to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement for equality of opportunity and treatment for each of the 6 States, that when the level of freight costs reaches a point at which the trade and commerce of one of those States are involved and the economic progress and development of that State are threatened, this would amount to a contravention in 2 respects of the Commonwealth Constitution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Democratic Labor Party feels that the Commonwealth should lay down as a matter of principle, so far as it lies within its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do so, that the use of land for pine plantations should wherever possible be in areas of this kind rather than in areas which would involve the displacement of the natural flora. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of motion add ‘and that the medical, social environmental, and legal aspects of the report and recommendations of the Committee be referred to the Standing Committees on Health and Welfare, Social Environment and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, respectively, and that these 3 Committees be authorised to undertake the continuing oversight of those aspects and to recommend from time to time what further measures might be taken to implement the recommendations or to overcome the problems revealed in the report’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs might say of any Bill which was in any way concerned with the matter, ‘If you are to implement the Committee’s recommendations, the appropriate course is to make various amendments to the legislation before the Senate.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720817_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has consistently maintained that the initiative for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> develop ment should lie with the House of Assembly to which it looks to represent the wishes of the majority of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adequate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers for such an effort are already available to the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also raised in the course of this dissent the suggestion that under section 116 of the Constitution it is highly questionable whether it is within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth Government to give financial assistance to the training of teachers who are specifically concerned not only with imparting neutral nonreligious knowledge to students but also with training them in being specifically Catholic, or Presbyterian, or Jewish teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect, I think that the Commonwealth would probably be going beyond its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power if it did attempt to allocate moneys to specifically religious training or to training which included the religious training of the teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise, however, that there is a substantial difference between the situation in which the Attorney-General is asked to grant his fiat to ensure that public duties are performed and, thereby, to overcome a deficiency when a private citizen has no locus standi because the duty is owed to the public, and the situation where the Attorney-General is, in effect, asked to lend his name to proceedings for the purpose of challenging the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not appropriate, in my view, in the public interest, for the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth an grant his fiat in proceedings directed to establishing that Commonwealth Statutes are unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent case before the High Court of Australia made it clear that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions leave it in the hands of this Parliament to provide, for the 18-year- olds, if they are to be provided for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court held that even if the States gave their 18-year-old citizens the right to vote this did not automatically allow them to have a vote in Federal elections, because the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee of Federal voting  Tights  for those who bad State voting rights applied only  to  those whom the Constitution described as adult persons who, in the understanding of 1901, were persons of 21 years or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  it must be remembered that we are dealing with probably one of the greatest issues in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense that has come before a parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there is under the Australian Constitution no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> restriction on the power of the Federal Parliament to enact such a law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Parliament deliberately and intentionally does that there is a very clear breach of some fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, the overriding <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem that the Commonwealth has no general criminal jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power it is clear that the Commonwealth has power over the interstate trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one is dealing with the prospective energy requirements of a nation, of which natural gas will be a important part, I do not think it is useful to divert this argument into what the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers may be because this is a subject which is fundamental to this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that, because of our strange <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation, the protection of the environment is not a matter that can be handled without the closest co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee then goes on to recommend the use of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> machinery of an Interstate Commission which, it says, it might be desirable to set up with powers in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that under the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements the States are very jealous of the powers they have in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the suggestions that have been made about the matter, will the Minister, rather than leaving it at that stage, put before the Senate at the earliest opportunity some opinion from the appropriate Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal authorities, explaining precisely to the Senate whether any approval was given and, if so, what kind of approval and for what purposes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator McManus  asked me a question I was remembering my halcyon days on the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources when we directed a lot of our time to this problem of interstate trade and the consequential legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal position as understood by the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does it not seem, therefore, that Western Australia is entitled to have 10 members elected, as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right, at the forthcoming election? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it has that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right it may well be that the provisions of the Electoral Act, which do not conform with that view, will not prevail against the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest that one thing which emerges out of this as a matter of extreme urgency and importance is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position should be put to rest as quickly as possible Certainly consideration ought to be given by this chamber, if not by the other place, to what should be done in the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Subsequently, the Standing Committee was reported as having formed the opinion that legislation to effect a uniform reduction in the voting age would present no legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems, but that the question of a reduction in the voting age is ultimately a matter of government policy and not to be decided by committees of A Attorneys-General . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Senate is entitled to know what is, in the opinion of the legal advisers of the Commonwealth, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in relation to the representation of Western Australia and whether, in fact, one more representative should be elected at large from that State or whether some other method needs to be adopted in order that the requirements of the Constitution can be met in relation to this election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  spoke apparently about some incident which was aired about 6 weeks or 2 months ago on which there was a good deal of discussion and in relation to which finally I went on a national television programme and explained - I think to the entire satisfaction of all - that if the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights which are guaranteed to citizens were to be vindicated a certain course of action ought to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral: What is the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position regarding zone allowances under the taxation system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it not been quite definitely established that zone allowances introduced in 1945 have withstood a High Court test as to validity and has the constitutionality of such allowances been put beyond question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Commonwealth Territories we have complete <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to see that in a wood chip industry reafforestation is carried out in accordance with all the good practices that this country wants to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in that matter relates to price control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is of great importance that as speedily as possible we should come to grips with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review which will include a good look at section 96 of the Constitution and at the shortcomings of the whole of our Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention which is contemplated at the instance of the States, in which the Commonwealth will participate and about which a steering committee has met already to plan the mode of approach for a review of the Constitution, undoubtedly will take into its ambit of consideration this vexed question of Commonwealth and State financial relations, and it is certainly time that that was done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can only hope that that will be one of the early matters considered by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention because we must always remember that under the present concept of the Constitution the States are substantially the developing and construction authorities, that the Commonwealth has complete control over the major resources of revenue, and that the reconciliation of those 2 things can be accompanied only by the development and the projection of a proper financial formula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that whatever our views may be on the principle of estate duty, constitutionally the most that we can do in this place is to direct our minds to the elimination of that duty insofar as it is imposed under Federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we can do is to go as far as we are entitled to do constitutionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in our approach to it we would say that we wish to eliminate it as far as we can in the Federal sphere under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do feel that the Government giving these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alleviations is now sensitive to the undesirability of the retention of this tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is competent for any State to make representations to the Commonwealth, under the guidelines which we all know about, for special grants or special aid if there are problems which the State considers go beyond its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> capabilities or perimeter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I point out that clause 4 provides for the Act to draw upon <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers in addition to the corporations power which at present is the source of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power for the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause is to ensure that the Act applies to as large a proportion of all restrictive agreements and practices operating in Australia as the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power may permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the results of our deliberations would have consequences in the civil field has been the subject of considerable discussion, especially between ourselves and our 2 dissentient colleagues, who take the view that we have disregarded the wider <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and social consequences of reducing the age of capacity in the field of private civic law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When ‘in accordance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> customs’ (not, mind you, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law) the petition was brought to your notice you took 6 weeks to inform  His Excellency  you had confidence in your minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to  Senator Byrne’s  question, I reiterate that the Standing Orders Committee has presently under consideration the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Senate and its committees after a dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must not repeat all the mistakes that were made by other countries on the pretext that private enterprise is involved and that this matter has nothing to do with the Commonwealth or that the Commonwealth has not <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is significant that in relation to the infamous Queensland Act the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  who was then Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who was then in the Minister in charge of Aboriginal Affairs both said that if the Queensland Government did not toe the line the Commonwealth, with its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, would make it toe the line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the economic progress and development of one State is threatened by the high level of freight costs, could this be construed as a contravention of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees of equality of opportunity and treatment of the States and of freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Yuill’s  paper has already been made available by my Department to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to assist that Committee in its consideration of family law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the desirability and practicability of establishing family courts is a matter that is necessarily involved in the consideration the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is giving to family law reform, it would be inappropriate for me at this stage to make any recommendation to the Government as to whether or not a family court or family courts should be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It comes within the scope of a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, I refer to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> foundation of the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However clause 4 provides for the Act to draw on other available <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, there was a cloud in that the High Court had made a restrictive interpretation of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of this Parliament which had given rise to doubts as to whether effective action could be taken by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the belief of the Labor Party that within Australia such changes can be brought about by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> political action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A prescribed flight is a flight which is within Australia, or between Australian territories, or from a territory to somewhere else in Australia: in other words it is a flight lying within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ambit of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ambit of power to which such offences may be attached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, we legislated to make it an offence to take certain action in aircraft which were flying in Australia, in respect of international aircraft which were on the last leg of their trip to Australia or the first leg of their trip out of Australia, and in respect of crimes committed on Commonwealth aircraft wherever those aircraft might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What  Senator McLaren  did not tell the Senate is that under its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers the Commonwealth cannot legislate alone to grant the power of compulsory acquisition to the Australian Wool Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In May 1971, at a time of great public interest in the subject, I requested the Attorney-General to prepare a paper on the parliamentary committee system which would give particular attention to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position and the provision of guidelines for the protection of witnesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that as a result of questions that have been addressed to me from time to time over the last 3 weeks I havementioned to them that there appears to me to be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> anomaly in relation to the dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This question raises matters of profound <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and parliamentary importance which require careful inquiry and deliberation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>without prejudice to any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights, that Senate committees be directed to refrain from meeting and transacting business after the forthcoming dissolution of the House of Representatives, except with the permission of the  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of responsibilities and financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States, it is for the Stale Governments to evaluate the needs of local authorities and to meet those needs from within their own resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework the States have immense responsibilities for the development of the States and the sustenance of their people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ask: From where does the Government get the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for the granting of moneys to child care centres? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fail to see where there is any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for the granting of moneys in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should think that the Attorney-General would not move in this direction if there were no such <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore request htm to inform me as to where the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for such legislation by the Commonwealth lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He queried the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis for legislation of this character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to mention 2 points in relation to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that a man holding the position of Attorney-General would have known the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question could be raised of whether there is correctly a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, but the fact is that everyone is sympathetic to aged persons homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be unfortunate if the scheme came into operation, was contested and found to be unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there is doubt in the Department about whether <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power exists in relation to this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point which brought  Senator James  McClelland breathless into the chamber and has always attracted  Senator Cavanagh’s  interest,  1  do not have with me at the present time the legal opinions which were provided to the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as  1  was concerned, there was no suggestion that the Opposition was challenging this measure because of its lack of constitutionality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  do not think  Senator Gietzelt,  who was the leading  speaker  for the Opposition during the second reading debate on this Bill, was suggesting that it should not be passed because of some lack of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor, I imagine, would the Labor Party as a Party be seeking to say that it should rely upon some legal technicality or legal doubt or lack of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis as a reason why this highly desirable legislation should not be enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the Constitution justifies this legislation, then one also would have to go to other sections of the Constitution to build up a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> case, if that is the way in which he would seek to approach the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor do I query the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to have it clear in my mind whether the Government had the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate in this way or whether it should legislate as it does in relation to grants to schools under section 96 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But do I take it from his reply that the advisers of his Department are of the opinion that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power does exist for the introduction of this legislation which is before us at the present time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to sovereignty over territorial waters, if the Senate is to take an attitude on this most important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and national question it should be done in a very definite way, perhaps by a specific resolution and after proper debate directed to that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very fine point - probably a fine <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point - as to whether the Senate has any right to continue to function in the absence of a viable House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether that is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position is a problem of very great import and of very great complexity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That available <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means under the trade and commerce power be called upon to effect this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730227_senate_28_s55/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs had before it a reference by the Senate concerning the law and administration of divorce, custody and family matters and was in the process of conducting an inquiry by taking evidence from the judiciary, the legal profession, academics and representative organisations; and thirdly, the fact that the Attorney-General himself sat on such committee and would be aware of the complexity, difficulty and variance of opinion on the subject of reviewing the field of matrimonial and family law, I ask: Will the Attorney-General suspend the operation of the amended rules, refer the suspended rules to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when that Committee is reconstituted and defer any further similar action until the Committee has presented a report to the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the other part of the question as to whether the rules ought to be considered by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is that I think that is a very good idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls it also a fact that before the rules were brought into effect neither the office of the Parliamentary Counsel nor the officers of his Department were given an opportunity to comment on their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity or consistency with legislation passed by this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator peruses the Hansard report of evidence given to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when it dealt with this matter of divorce law reform he will see that a great deal of advice was given by a number of persons as to what should be done about the drafting of the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are so represented for the purpose of enabling them to maintain and protect their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights against attempted invasions, and to give them every facility for the advocacy of their peculiar and special interests, as well as for the ventilation and consideration of their grievances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If ever the Senate were called upon to take its stand in terms of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position and in terms of the very purpose for which it was created, it is now to step in and prevent this happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is legal opinion - how strong it is, T do not know - that the matter is open to grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt and there may need to be no consultation whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a position which opens the possibility, looking at the matter in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework, that the Commonwealth Parliament with Her Majesty in Council - whether that would be Her Majesty in the Executive Council of Australia or in the Privy Council in England - could unilaterally and without consulting anybody whatsoever transfer these territories to Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister said that the Australian Government was willing in principle to negotiate the relocation of the border and indeed was keen to do so and would not allow any narrow considerations to obstruct a settlement, but the Government noted that there were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> considerations which had to be taken into account and which might delay the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider in the light of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> recitation which I have given the Senate that the Commonwealth conceivably could proceed by unilateral action - or not inconceivably - then there is both the opportunity and the proclaimed intention It could well be that these islands would be transferred by Act of the Commonwealth <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The might and the power of the Commonwealth may well be mustered without any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> inhibitions to sever these islands from the State of Queensland, to completely truncate part of a nation, a total ethnic group, and put it in another nation embracing a multitude of races with which it would be totally alien. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators want to debate the merits of this matter or, as was suggested by  Senator Bynoe,  think that this; should be considered by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, I would love to have that done, and as speedily as possible..

    <p>Is the Attorney-General awus that on 22nd February 1913 the then Acting Prime Minister stated that the Commonwealth Government had decided not to seek leave to intervene in the High Court case involving the question of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Tasmanian tobacco tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972 was subsequently introduced, in terms substantially similar to those of the Ordinance, but was referred for consideration by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That a select committee be appointed to inquire into -.mil report upon the desirability and feasibility of establishing a Securities and Exchange Commission by the Commonwealth either alone or in co-operation with the States and the powers and functions necessary for such a commission to enable it to act speedily and efficiently, against manipulation of prices, insider trading and such other improper or injurious practices as the committee finds have occurred or may occur in relation to shares and other securities of public companies, and to recommend generally in regard to the foregoing such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of legislative power in Australia, enable the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position is that the Government is not obliged to take notice of the reports of committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, as Attorney-General I took prompt note of the report made by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> ana Legal Affairs which recommended the abolition of discretion statements from the divorce rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the honourable senator has mentioned divorce I should point out that the rules made touching divorce will prove, once they are examined carefully, to have been drawn in such a way as to show that close attention has been paid to the weight of opinion put before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can gather, the unanimous view of those who gave evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and of those who have discussed this matter in any way publicly is that such discretion statements should be abolished; they are an abomination in the law and should not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has made its position clear that it considers that Ideal government is’  now,  and perhaps tuts’, been for some time;’- so’ important to the conduct df our society that it ought to have a place in any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention and that it ought to have a greater role in the affairs of the  nation,  However, I cannot answer with any certainty the honourable senator’s question as to whetherlocal government will be represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I do not know whether what  Mr Barnard  may have thought was the appropriate way in which these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions and their consequences ‘are to be dealt with is worth pursuing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of answering a number of questions which have been asked of him concerning the matrimonial causes rales,  Senator Murphy  has constantly referred to the evidence which has been received by the former Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 will be anxious to take up the suggestion which was made a few days ago by either  Senator Byrne  or  Senator McManus  that I ought to go before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and explain to it why the changes in the rules were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What 1 would prefer to do and what I was invited to do here about a week ago is to go before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and put material before that Committee, and then let the public of Australia judge whether it was necessary for me to intervene and to reform the rules in order to remove some of these abuses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand we have  Senator Durack  complaining that I have referred to evidence that has been given publicly and published in the Hansard record of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with that, I moved in the Senate, after I had moved for the establishment of certain Senate standing committees, that there be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs the matter of the law and its administration regarding divorce, custody and family matters, with particular regard to oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of evidence has been given before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which, on examination, would appal one in that a series of Attorneys-General had allowed the law to continue in that state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to the reported statement of the Minister for the Environment and Conservation that he is powerless to act in any matters of conservation and that the Federal Government had no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has even been suggested that it is beyond <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and that in no matter whatever might the Australian Parliament even intervene to prevent charging by practitioners in excess of what has been laid down in the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion is made that this is beyond <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and that those who were perpetrating these rackets could continue doing so and that it is beyond the power not only of the Australian Government but even of the Australian Parliament to deal with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share the view of most members of the community and certainly the view of most of those who have reflected on and written about this subject or who have given evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs proceeds with its inquiry into the question of divorce, I have no doubt that whatever submissions the body wants to make will come before that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir, I  have already asked a question of you - to which I have not yet received an answer - in relation to  Senator Murphy’s  use of documents, which were submitted to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, to answer a number of the questions that have been put to him over the last few days in relation to the matrimonial causes rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They made a very substantial submission to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last July the signatories hereto on behalf of the Committee submitted detailed proposals to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee urged the Government to further the inquiry 0f the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs into the basic principles of present divorce laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Next, may I refer to the document which  Senator Durack  referred to and which has been published - the Hansard report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reasonable that one should turn to what was formally put before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That weighty evidence was put before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think, in terms of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements against the establishment of religions, that such a provision should exist on the statute books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say again to the honourable senator that it appears to me that persons have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights whether we agree with them or not, and that after a thorough consideration of the issues before him a magistrate found that a certain organisation had come into being as a church - an incorporated church with a constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to intervene in the States’ control of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am further given to understand that the advice forthcoming from the Attorney-General to the Minister for Immigration about this matter - the Attorney-General can correct me or indicate otherwise - was that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision reached by the Government was taken not only on policy grounds but on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit,  Mr Deputy President,  that all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> precedents clearly establish that this is a debate which just cannot proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, in addition to these matters, many technical objections to the rules, both from the legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But,  Mr President,  the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of ASIO goes further than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have a unique inversion of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, which Parliament has laid down in those unique terms, invaded by the Attorney-General, not on any basis of default, maladministration or distrust by ASIO, but in a case where the Organisation has never refused the Minister any information requested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These facts show a dismal abuse of the unique <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in Australia, and we al] ought to be obliged to  Senator Greenwood  for raising this subject on the first opportunity tonight that enabled us to raise it since it could not be fully explored at question time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hesitate to give a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> opinion but it is probable that all members of ASIO who suffered this tort, instigated by the Attorney-General, would have a right of action against the Commonwealth for this interference with their rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reforms stand well within the scope and intendment of the Act and within <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some point may arise as to whether a select committee is also a standing committee within the terms of the legislative and general purpose standing committees of which the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this Committee has indicated that the documents which it has in its custody - the documents of the earlier <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee - are not to be published except by order of this Committee, it would be wrong for any senator or any member of the public to refer directly or indirectly to the submissions which have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Murphy  has said, the people who have given evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, including the Chief Judge in Divorce in New South Wales,  Mr Justice  Selby, have said, amongst other things, that the discretion statement is such an abomination and such a blot on our law that it cannot disappear too soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 do agree with one thing that  Senator James  McClelland said in the speech he has just concluded, that is, his statement that it would not have been sensible for the Government or any honourable senator to rush in with a new divorce law before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs had reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the discretion statement was the subject of a great deal of criticism before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when it was conducting its inquiry last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Durack  said that although he does not think that the discretion statement should be removed by amendment of the rules, nonetheless he apparently, as a member of the Senate <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, was in favour of the abolition of the discretion statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and other lawyers oppose separate hearings for the principal relief and matters relating to custody, maintenance and matrimonial property, but there is no doubt that some of the strongest evidence which was given to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Committee on this matter was given by  Mr Justice  Selby, the Chief Judge in Divorce of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate has been conscious of this need was demonstrated by the fact that a reference of the whole question of divorce was made to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that already there is a reference before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs as to the whole matter of divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances I support the motion for disallowance of the rules and indicate to honourable senators that if the motion is carried, as I expect it will be carried, tomorrow I shall move in the terms of the motion I have stated, and the reference will be laid down to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs with a suggestion that the earliest possible consideration be given to an examination of this segment of the divorce situation so that the position can be remedied insofar as concepts which are embodied in these rules that are worth preserving be embodied in proper statutory form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the heading ‘Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees’ the first item is the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that in the interim period the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs will be able to complete its work and report to the Senate, and that a thorough review of both the Act and the rules appropriate to this day and age, 1973. will be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His speech consisted of a series of quotations from the evidence of witnesses and statements submitted mainly to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was then referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, where it has reposed for the last 12 months, apparently without any action being taken by that Committee to report to the Senate as to whether the substantive provisions were or were not adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs it was necessary to have some legislation to continue in force a body of law  of  evidence in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This country depends upon the maintenance of the judiciary as a separate arm of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the country in a very special sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the first thing we should be conscious of is that the Senate has certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, some of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> treatises go so far as to say that the other powers and authorities of the individual back bencher have been so eroded that perhaps this is the only effective parliamentary exercise that is still left to the back bencher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in any degree a proposition to which I subscribe, but the fact that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities go so far indicates the importance of erasing from the record the proposition that there is no obligation upon  a  Minister to answer questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hear the interjections; ‘He cannot read’ and ‘The Tasmanian devil’ coming from the side whose leader has rested upon dignity to curtail our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to question, and the insulting suggestion is made that I take a sentence out of context and do not convey its substantial meaning, and I am asked to read the whole of the text. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am a patient soul, a submissive soul, but very persistent in the pursuit of principle and the preservation of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of this chamber, and not only the preservation, the improvement of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to say that if a Minister in this chamber is to be absolved from the obligation to answer questions according to ministerial responsibility, having regard to our other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations, that constitutes an important deprivation of our fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have dealt with the matter from the points of view of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, questioning being a particular right of the Opposition with a corresponding obligation upon a Minister to answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard an emotional speech from  Senator Wright  on the dignity, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and ability of the Senate by force of numbers to take all day if need be to ask questions oh matters of national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the, Senate thinks it proper to do so, it may then refer the legislation for report - I hope urgent report - by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee so that as soon as possible we can get some humane law which is simple, dignified and inexpensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Cotton  should remember that in the 23 years during which the Government of which he was a member for quite a considerable period of time had control of the Treasury benches nothing was done about the attempt by the former Labor government to obtain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that was put forward on Labor’s behalf at that time explained to the people of Australia exactly what would happen as a consequence of there not being sufficient <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power for the Commonwealth Government to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard speakers say tonight: ‘Would it not have been better in post war years if the Australian people had given the government of the day <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power over prices?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My Party said when in government that no government needed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our government provided an average rate of inflation at the lower level of  2i  per cent a year for something like three-quarters of the time that it was in office without that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This gives rise to the suspicion that he played the role of agent provocateur in the matter of the Warburton explosives cache and, in fact, possibly in relation to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> documents of  HIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Applying similar <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions, the United States Supreme Court has, for the last 9 years and more, declared any form of malapportionment within a State to be unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is what the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review 1959 described as a form of gerrymandering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the 1965 amendments were completely contrary to the 1959 views of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President  felt, I think quite rightly, that he did not have the power under the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and that he certainly did not have power vested in him by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the desirability and feasibility of establishing a Securities and Exchange Commission by the Commonwealth either alone or in co-operation with the States and the powers and functions necessary -for such: a commission to enable it  to  act speedily and efficiently against manipulation of prices, insider trading and such other improper or injurious practices as the Committee finds have occurred or may occur in relation to shares and other securities of public companies, and to recommend generally in regard to the foregoing such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of legislative power in Australia, enable the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the years in the United States there has been a complication in relation to federal offences, presumably because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That Committee found that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> concepts underlying the legislation were inconsistent with what should be the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship between the Parliament and executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the alleged dichotomy of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, there is a lack of effective supervision and co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was the rather complex <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  I would like to present a statement on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> difficulties would necessarily arise in an attempt to discipline and control the pollution of such streams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the Bill has been inserted following the examination of the clauses of this measure which was conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when this matter was before the Senate in late 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the reference to Imperial Acts is removed, the situation which existed before the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs looked at this matter will be sustained, and that will have the effect that the various provisions of the Army Act of the United Kingdom and the Naval Discipline Act of the United Kingdom would not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was set out in the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in December 1971: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which is chaired by a Government senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will drive the Government into a position where it will seek, by every <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means, to correct what is happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position is that because newspapers which circulate in a State are registered under an Act of Parliament of that State the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction at all over newspapers or newspaper articles which might appear from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee will report on the need for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform including the delineation of Federal and State jurisdiction in labour relations and the limitations of Commonwealth power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Limitations <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No single legislative body, State or Federal, is capable of dealing with all the legal questions involved or of propounding a solution that will hold in every industrial jurisdiction, under present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, it was the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government which proceeded with the gerrymander in 1965, despite the fact that the Parliament - I think in 1956 - had set up the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review with the express purpose of investigating electoral reform in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the amendments contained in this Bill are not the brain-child only of the Australian Labor Party; they are the brainchild of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which tabled its unanimous report on these 2 questions on 26th November 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee concluded that the absence of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees in the Commonwealth Constitution had not prevented the rule of law from characterising the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, the Committee considers it appropriate, at this stage of Federal history and having regard to recent and contemporary world events, to recommend a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to protect the position of the elector and the democratic processes essential to the proper functioning of the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as I wanted the record to be right about the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, I would like for the benefit of future research to read into the Hansard report the Labor Party’s platform on electoral reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have told the Senate about the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review and I have told it about the Australian Labor Party point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once the class of voters is chosen and their qualifications specified, we see no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way, in which equality of voting may be evaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party, the expert and learned legal opinion of the High Court of Ireland and that of the Supreme Court of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak of the principles that have been recommended to the Parliament by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Government is asking the Senate to do tonight is exactly the same as was recommended by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation before the Senate tonight affords a wonderful opportunity to carry out a recommendation of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which was unanimously supported by every person associated with that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that if  Senator Drake-Brockman  and other honourable senators opposite find something outrageous or reprehensible about (he Tasmanian quotas, one would have expected that in the 23 years during which they sat on the Treasury bench they would have done something in the way of sponsoring <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there is no suggestion in their criticism of the amendments that we are putting before the Senate that the cure for the Tasmanian question is that there should be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that one would hope in vain to hear from  Senator Wright  - that doughty champion of the rights of Tasmania - any suggestion that the number of seats in Tasmania should be reduced by amendment, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform or any other method. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation that we of the Labor Party are putting forward is in line with a recommendation of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review as long ago as 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J state for the benefit of those honourable senators such as  Senator James  McClelland, who sneered and said that  Senator DrakeBrockman  did not know the Constitution, that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision for the representation of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 remember the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review of 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I reminded the Senate last night, the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review reported  on  this matter in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his contribution to the debate last evening  Senator Carrick  painted a false picture when he endeavoured to create the impression that the evidence of one of the witnesses before the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review represented the view of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at the draft <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations suggested by that Committee to see that I am correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard a tirade of abuse from  Senator Carrick  - a performance for which he is becoming notorious in recent times - suggesting that there is something ulterior about the Labor Government’s attempt to implement the all-Party recommendations of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to suggest that the Labor Party is committed to a firm policy on this matter, that it is seeking to ignore the expressed will of the people and that it is seeking to bring about a situation where there will be elected a government that will not reflect the will of the people is quite contrary to the expressed views of the Leader of the Labor Party, of the platform of the Party and of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which found sufficient weight of evidence to make a unanimous recommendation to the Parliament in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourteen years have elapsed since the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review was tabled in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, despite what  Senator Carrick  of the Liberal Party had to say last night, a 10 per cent electoral tolerance was recommended by the all-Party Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, which was set up in 1956 and which reported to the Parliament in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review of 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy states that the recommendations of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review will be implemented by a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliamentary Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review to which  1  have already referred was not particularly happy about that type of gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee concluded that the absence of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees in the Commonwealth Constitution had not prevented the rule of law from characterising the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, the Committee considers it appropriate, at this stage of Federal history and having regard to recent and contemporary world events, to recommend a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to protect the position of the elector and the democratic processes essential to the proper functioning of the Federal Parliament 329. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do not they agree with what was recommended by the independent authority in 1959, the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review set up by this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion I am sorry that I cannot agree with the way in which he referred to the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it mean that the Prime Minister intends to provoke a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has placed great emphasis on the fact that it has taken the terms of the Bill from the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Services and Property in another place and his representative here, the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy),  have rested their argument for this on what they call the recommendations of the Joint Committee <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return, to support the remarks I have just made, to the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that 1 was a member of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which reported in 1959 and that one of the recommendations of that Committee to which I subscribed was that the margin of difference from the quota should be one-tenth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That gives support to the expert opinion which was given to the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> (Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of the agreements is subject to ratification in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements of each country and is to enter into force on the day on which the instalments of ratification are exchanged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Indonesian Government has in fact already taken the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> steps necessary for their ratification of both the 1971 and 1972 seabed agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where before in Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history could a government rely on a pronouncement by  the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So severe and so dramatic have those stresses been, and into so many areas do they intrude, that the States have called for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention to take a completely new look at the Constitution to see whether some more equitable and more effective distribution of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power cannot be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this convention is to be held with the maximum goodwill and if it is to achieve a proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reconciliation and a proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of powers, that can only be accomplished in an atmosphere of mutual goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it would relate to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would doubt whether in a Bill such as this we have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to alter the legitimacy of children for the purpose of inheritance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we have, the point, which lawyers can take up much better than I can, as to whether the Bill is subject to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge and whether it might not be set aside under some particular Acts that might be dredged up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That view was identical with the recommendation that was put forward by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review as far back as 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spent half his time quoting from the report of a committee  -  I think it was the report of the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review - about the need to integrate and co-ordinate transport in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Though the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> link has not yet been severed, we shall increasingly consider our policies towards Papua New Guinea not in any nostalgic colonial sense, but as though we were already dealing with a fully independent state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To those of the Left or the Right who preach in Australia the doctrine of violence, I have only this to say: I shall use unremittingly and support without qualification my colleagues who join me in using the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Institutional powers invested in my Government to end political violence in Australia.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the Commonwealth does have sovereignty in these areas under its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers relating to foreign affairs and defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sensible attempt to have clarified a field of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power around which some mists have gathered over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that all the issues concerned in this matter had been abundantly canvassed and considered by members and senators from both sides of the respective chambers and that everybody - <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities, academics, State Premiers and the public at large - had had ample opportunity to say what he thinks for and against this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the continental shelf is the product of an exercise by the Australian national Government of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers in respect of external affairs, and it seems to me to be impossible to deny that this Parliament has power to legislate for what may be found - whether petroleum or minerals - within that continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it would be readily conceded that, according to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doctrine for the last 40 years, every State has had power to make laws of an extra-territorial operation in regard to anything that affects the peace, order and good government of a State, in most cases out as far as the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing is that the States’ authority in that respect would always be subject to the overriding authority of the Commonwealth, if the 2 governments make laws within the authority of their own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that from the point of view of the exploitation of minerals and petroleum, there can be very little question as to the Australian Parliament having <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to exploit the continental shelf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Press would only look at the thing in perspective it would see that this Bill does not threaten the fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes that the features of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) legislation to which it has taken objection arise directly because the issue of contitutional authority has not been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in the national interest ultimately for questions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority where uncertainty exists to be put aside - in fact to the exclusion of the High Court which in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework is charged wilh their determination and, in effect, as the Committee has indicated, to the exclusion of effective Parliamentary decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that Committee, a most able Committee representative of all sections of the Senate, found that that type of legislation denies true ministerial responsibility and excludes from the Constitution the proper resolution of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers by the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, having the expressed will of the Parliament, let the States argue their contention before the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> tribunal, the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, on the motion of the Opposition, the matter was referred to the appropriate Senate Standing Committee - the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party, in its consideration of the matter, has agreed that, in the light of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the disclosure of the exact details of the quantum of some of the benefits conferred by this legislation, the Bill requires further examination because the provisions in it are enormously out of step with all other forms of compensation for death or injury which exist in Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the Commonwealth Parliament, in the exercise of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, enacted the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act which was intended to cover and to state exhaustively the circumstances in which telephones could be tapped - to use the popular expression - by authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission was established and for some reason it was found to be not <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission was in conflict with the proper separation of power because it was given certain functions which would not stand up constitutionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I doubt very much whether this procedure is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> where it involves payments to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being an item of new policy it is required by our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice to be introduced in the amendable Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation that would require the Government to force the measure through here or go to the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my submissions I referred only to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles that should govern the presentation of Appropriation Bills, particularly in regard to those that present new policy expenditure for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not in accordance with proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are the States in an area such as housing, which it is their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to administer, to be dictated to in this way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party wishes to talk about mandates let it take into account the other side of the coin which is that there is a clear mandate, at least as far as the Victorian Government is concerned in respect of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to govern its own housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Bills are yet another example of the product of a government which is determined to take from the States the right to determine their future even in areas in which they have clear <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to determine their future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> developments were in accordance with section 122 of the Constitution which provides, in part: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term provided for each of these Territorial senators is not 6 years, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> period for State senators, except in the case of double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has adapted the method which was unanimously agreed to 15 years ago by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, upon which all parties in the House were represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to bring the elections of Territory senators into line with those of the House of Representatives is in accordance with the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee’s findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general aspect of SEATO is that each constituent state will take note of a situation and act within its own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Before we all get carried away with these wild accusations you of all people being a former Treasurer and Privy Councillor should realise that there are financial limitations besides other legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions which would prevent such situations, and therefore your public acceptance of this nonsense astounds me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point to which I referred when the matter was last before us was that we had referred this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some examples are given in the supplementary report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I refer to one or two things which appeared in the supplementary report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amount is substantially less than the figure of $211,000 quoted in the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some other related and more minor matters are raised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mark this -  in the light of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the disclosure of the exact details of the quantum of some of the benefits conferred by this legislation, the Bill requires further examination because the provisions in it are enormously out of step with all other forms of compensation for death or injury which exist in Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there not in the House of Representatives people who are capable of understanding the terms of this Bill without having them pointed out to them by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senators who subscribed their names to the supplementary submissions appended to the Report on the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Bill, 1973 presented by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs stated - I take it with approval: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to which this matter was referred and I do not wish to canvass the matters which were canvassed by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we do feel that the nature of the controversial provisions is such that they require further examination and that, in view of the close scrutiny which these provisions received in the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this matter was being debated on 12 April and when, on the motion of the Opposition, the Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for a report, I stated - my remarks appear at page 1080 of Hansard - that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We favour the decision taken by the Senate some time ago that this matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in substance has been the main objection of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great problems which the Senate has found with this Bill is that when the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs considered the Bill it became apparent that the Opposition would wish to move a large number of amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surprisingly,  Senator Byrne,  who was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which reported on this Bill, has now moved what amounts to another adjournment of the consideration of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms ‘subject’ and ‘citizenship’ denote the same status when they are applied to countries which might be described as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing that stands crystal clear is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect of the Queen and her Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is a clear cut area of responsibility between a government having a mandate and a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarch accepting that fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation; it is quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now writing local government into a new place within the Australian Federation, not perhaps in any formal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense, but pragmatically as a situation which is accepted and which from now on will be acknowledged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is wished to control such a waterway for the purpose of obviating pollution or controlling pollution there are grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties and grave differences between various local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, although the States are sovereign in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense, if they become applicants to the Grants Commission and recipients of special grants, their budgets also are subject to inspection and scrutiny by the Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have liked to see this matter thrashed out at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention which will commence later this year rather than to have it start off on this basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other disability is that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee in the Northern Territory that just terms will be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fervently to be hoped that the present Senate will not sign its own death warrant by passing this piece of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> chicanery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The addition of 4 territorial senators would, I believe, upset the balance and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role of the Senate as a States House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a chamber in which the States, considered as separate entities, are represented in such a way as to enable them to protect their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights against invasion and to advocate their peculiar and special interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of Territory representation in the Senate, and indeed in Parliament generally, was the subject of considerable debate at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention and also in the United States of America, on the Senate of which country our Senate was so closely modelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some doubts as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me, one who is not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, and no doubt if this legislation is passed the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers will argue, that there is some conflict in the Constitution because, as already mentioned by  Senator Jessop,  section 7 of the Constitution says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  said that there were some legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems to be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think if we are to show clearly why we oppose this legislation we should have a look at the interpretation or the com mentary on the Convention debates by these very distinguished Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and have a brief look, if time permits, at the report of the United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, particularly the 3 powerful minority reports which convinced Congress that territorial representation in the Senate should not be granted in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are so represented for the purpose of enabling them to maintain and protect their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights against attempted invasions . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equality of representation, it is argued, is a natural corollary of State representation, because the colonies were, prior to federation, politically equal; equal in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and status, although not necessarily equal in territory or population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the view of these distinguished Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So here we have quite clearly interpreted the intention of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> founders of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can relate this to our own Senate -  is an assembly of States and  it  is a deep concern of many of my colleagues that representation in the Senate by political entities other than States presents so fundamental a change of concept as to destroy the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> character of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House believe that these arguments are equally applicable to Australia and the Opposition holds strongly and firmly to the view that the representation in the Senate of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory would undermine the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Founding Fathers ensured that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the States were maintained and protected by providing in the Constitution equality of representation of the original States on the basis that the colonies prior to <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no hesitation whatsoever by the Government in introducing the seas and submerged lands Bills, which have real <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate of the United States is an assembly of States and it is the deep concern of many of my colleagues that representation in the Senate by political entities other than States presents so fundamental a change of concept as to destroy the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> character of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see that the Australian Government has joined with the States in having a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention to discuss the matters which affect the Government and the States and in order to balance the functions and the finances of the States, the Australian Government and local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see also in regard to the third-tier of government the insistence by the present Government that local government be brought into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention and that there be proper regard to its important role in the affairs of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister asked the Presiding Officers whether they could provide Hansard reporters to report the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is intended that the work of the Centre will be especially concerned with intergovernmental financial relations - including the problems of local government - with special reference to expenditure functions, inter-governmental co-operation, taxation and loan finance, grants, and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues affecting financial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the redistribution which the Government wishes to hold following changes to this Electoral Act, the 1977 redistribution would be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement similar to the present redistribution taking place in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is they which, with Her Majesty, are able to express in form of law the appropriate description of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Queen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The omission of ‘Defender of the Faith’, as was said on an earlier occasion, has the purpose of removing a reference which has no historical or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relevance for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What progress has the Government made in its endeavours to have local government officially represented at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention to be held next week in Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is proposed also that the representatives of local government would be able to speak on all matters of direct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> financial interest to local government and on any other matters on which the Convention resolved that they should speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does this Government not do the right thing and admit straight out that it does not have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to control prices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should have the sense to admit that it does not have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We came up against <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems as well as a reluctance on the part of New Zealanders, with some exceptions, to submit evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the words ‘subject to the following modifications - ‘, insert - “(aa) paragraph (1), after the words report on’, insert ‘the advancement of political responsibility and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory and’ “ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a committee should have as its main aim the advancement of political responsibility and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, my Party emphasised at that time that the most important matter that the Committee should devote itself to was the ongoing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the  Northern  Territory,  Mr Kep  Enderby announced today that Cabins Had approved that he ask the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory, when formally constituted, to undertake a a matter of priority a comprehensive inquiry into the Territory’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Enderby said that there appeared to be support for the principle of having a Parliamentary Committee Report on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> future of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition was moved to have an inquiry into <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Reform for the Legislative Council included in the Senate Resolution for the Committee’s appointment’ he continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is as well that I have this document in my hand because it assures me that the Government will agree that the first reference to the Committee shall be a reference on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I must take it that the Minister will be incorporating the statement which is headed: ‘Joint Committee on the Northern Territory - Draft Terms of Reference for Inquiry into the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development of the Northern Territory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE NORTHERN TERRITORY- DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INQUIRY INTO THE <span class="highlight">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> DEVELOPMENT OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure him that the people in the Northern Territory feel considerable concern about whether this supposed reference to inquire into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development is really, in some manner or other, an attempt to tie down the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that with the establishment of the proposed joint committee, now that it has been prompted by action taken in the Senate a few months ago, it will investigate the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that before  Senator Webster  goes out of this place he will stand on his feet in this House and say that the Committee has done its work in the very way the Minister wants it done, that is, to give <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform to the people of the Northern Territory, which was lacking for so many years under the Government which the honourable senator supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult for me, of course, to give those undertakings, but I think it ought to be said that if we read the original amendment which  Senator Webster  moved and which he has now withdrawn, we will see that he speaks there of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as we see in the first paragraph of the amendment which I have moved the wording of the amendment is, I think, of such reasonableness as to include the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform included in the honourable senator’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word ‘<span class="highlight">constitutional</span>’ does not, of course, appear, but I think that is a fair interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the decision made last week at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention whereby, I gather, the Australian Government proposes to hold a referendum aimed at amending the Australian Constitution to enable powers to be referred by this Parliament to State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was some mention by the Prime Minister at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of retail sales tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not at this stage committed to the adoption of its recommendations and will be continuing with its examination of it, including the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues which it raises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he swears allegiance to Australia it must be made clear that this sworn allegiance is legal, formal, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and complete. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question could be important because one could visualise a situation where, if matters are not done in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> form, perhaps at some time when some person is charged as was  Sir Roger  Casement, in order to establish his position he would go back to the treason laws applying in the reign of King Edward II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> conventions have taken place since the enactment of the Statute of Westminster and they are referred to in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, lt states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Crown is the symbol of the true association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united by a common allegiance to the Crown it would be in accord with the established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of all the members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Title shall hereafter require the assent as well of the Parliament of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention was therefore recognised by the Statute of Westminster that all members of the British Commonwealth should agree to any of the changes made in respect of the Royal Style and Titles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present stage of development of the British Commonwealth relationship, it would be in accord with the established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position that each member country should use for its own purposes a form of the Royal Style and Titles which suits its own particular circumstances and retains a substantial element ‘which is common to all ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 17 of the Acts Interpretation Act dennes <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms including, inter alia, ‘the Commonwealth’ and ‘Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications of section 8 of the Statute of Westminster, read together with the preamble of the Act- that is the Constitution Act- and the covering clause 2 of that Act, raise the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question whether it is possible for Australia in these circumstances to evolve an Act of succession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter is not only a question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law; it is also a question of great historical significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was quite correct in pointing out that, so far as Australia is concerned, in both <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law in the strict sense, the succession is determined by the Succession to the Throne of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the oath that we take in this Parliament is an oath of personal allegiance to the Queen, and obviously it is in strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms because, as I say, that is an oath to the Queen of Australia in the only terms in which constitutionally it may be taken or an affirmation may be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think that lightly to dismiss this matter as of some sentimental attraction without examining the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications of it is extraordinarily dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not competent for this Parliament to create a succession in the terms in which it must be adopted and proclaimed to make it constitutionally and legally viable in this Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again we get that firm proclamation of the only basis on which the sovereignty of the Queen in Australia can legally and constitutionally rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of this new insistence on the concept of Australian nationalism, which is so important and acceptable; nevertheless we cannot afford to disregard particularly the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications while we may be prepared- for the reasons which have been suggested- to lay aside the historical background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore when the Senate insists, as  Senator Davidson  proposes, on the amendment as originally proposed and rejected by the House of Representatives, I submit, on the authorities which I have quoted and on the recitation of the history of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, that the amendment reflects the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in the personalisation of the Queen in her right and title as sovereign of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It meets the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> demand that we accept, that is, that Queen Elizabeth is Queen of Australia in her right and title as Queen of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons I and  Senator Davidson  have enunciated I think that the Senate must insist on the amendment as originally projected as fulfilling the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and sentimental requirements of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am now expounding the views of the Democratic Labor Party on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is the seriousness of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defects to which we draw attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I speak of allegiance I refer to the formal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it the allegiance which a prospective citizen of Australia accepts is the allegiance which is formal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and which, as a matter of law, he owes to the society of which he is conscientiously and deliberately becoming a citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in terms of formal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationships and the obligations which the law imposes, I think we should insist, as far as we are able, upon Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the point raised bv  Senator Byrne,  which, he will be the first to admit, is a matter of constitutionality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certainly not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that he, among others, would have given consideration to the validity or otherwise of the Bill insofar as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Prior to the suspension of the sitting I had dealt with the point made by  Senator Greenwood  about dual citizenship, and I was dealing with the point made by  Senator Byrne  about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt on the validity of the proposed oath of allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had pointed out that the Bill had been drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel and that, as far as I know, he did not question or call into question the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt about the validity of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As I have said, I am not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we query is the technical situation as to whether there is not some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> invalidity in the non-reference to the queen as ‘Queen Elizabeth the Second’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was quite correct in pointing out that so far as Australia is concerned in both <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law in the strict sense the succession is determined by the succession to the throne of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition which we originally proposed and which we now restate and to which we adhere, that the form should be ‘Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia’, to my mind resolves the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt and predicates the affirmation of Queen Elizabeth the Second as Queen of Australia and therefore satisfies the growing national concern for an Australian national image and stature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne, speaking as a lawyer, says there may be some doubt about the constitutionality of that proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that there is no doubt about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the situation and therefore we press the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point could be raised that the form of allegiance was constitutionally unavailable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne,  I think in all sincerity, said that there is some doubt in his mind as to whether this is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is whether we have legal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the course of expressing that support I feel that it is appropriate to draw attention to some considerations which I think are highly pertinent both as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications of what has been done and also to the method by which this change has been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas it was recited in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, 1931 that it would be in accord with the established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations in relation to one another that any alteration in the law touching the Royal Style and Tides should, after the enactment of that Act, ‘require the assent as well of the Parliaments of all the Dominions as of the Parliament of the United Kingdom’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas it was concluded by the Prime Ministers and other representatives that, in the present stage of development of the British Commonwealth relationship, it would be in accord with the established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position that each member country should use for its own purposes a form of the Royal Style and Titles which suits its own particular circumstances but retains a substantial element which is common to all: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position cannot be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position is quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of a Royal Style and Titles Bill is to ensure that the way in which the monarch is referred to is consonant with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, the legal position and the aspirations of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are now in the twentieth century and a great continent at the other end of the earth is considering its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system and how we will face the challenges of our time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense- in the Constitution as we are required to observe it- that does not happen, and that is the proposition we have propounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the reasons why, central to the considerations of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee last week was the problem of enabling the national Parliament and Government to have adequate powers to manage the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course the Government goes onto the public platform and says that it lacks the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that it was the parliamentary Labor Party which is now the Government of the day that agitated to see that local governments would be represented at the historic Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, the first session of which has just concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that despite the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention we will continue to remain as one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee of the Party certainly did so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Australian Government could seek a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change by referendum, but acknowledged that the process takes some months, the number of months depending upon the attitude taken by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the basic approach taken by the Prime Minister at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney a fortnight ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters in the strictest sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Liberal-Country Party Opposition talks about what it would do about inflation; but what will it do when it gets the opportunity to do something about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I say, we have had a look at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in relation to prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just over 2 weeks ago the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  put the proposition to the State Premiers at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention to give the Commonwealth power to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He again raised it at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the gravamen of their objection to this Bill is that they oppose the Australian people being given the opportunity to express, by referendum, their opinion, as to whether or not the democratically elected Parliament of Australia should have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore they will fight any move to give the central Government further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister took over- quite rightly, because he is the elected Prime Minister- being in charge of the arranging of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which had been mooted by State Premiers and the previous Government and which was held in Sydney early this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, unfortunately, it would appear that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which was a pipe opener for the needed consideration of required <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments, turned into a mini Premiers Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a fact that the master, who had said that there would be no more Premiers Conferences, turned the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention into a mini Premiers Conference and that nothing to dampen the fires of inflation resulted from that meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A celebrated statesman of earlier years, when stating why <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments had a long history of defeat, said that it was obvious that they always would have because of the way the Constitution was set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the Senate of what the Prime Minister told members in the other place and what Senate Murphy told us last night about what took place at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have said that the Australian Parliament should have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all honourable senators on the Government side know that without <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power the Prices Justification Tribunal, although very nice, is really worth very little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to reports that the Chilean military junta is executing and torturing supporters of the late <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of State,  President  Allende? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As these persons support social change by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means, does not the persecution of” Chilean citizens offend democratic procedures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The message which was forwarded with the Bill requests the Senate to concur in the view that the people should be asked to express an opinion promptly on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I do so, I suppose that we ought to make up our minds whether we are to have a debate on this motion for the next 2 or 3 hours instead of getting on with the debate on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Prices) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Monday it was regarded as an important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter by the Government and it was forced through the House of Representatives in a couple of hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing more important than a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> decision in Australia and there is a time limit because of the Christmas period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is traditional that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration proceeds with great patience, forethought and preparation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ordinarily a prudent government would enter into consultation with elements of the Parliament to see what degree  of support  was forthcoming for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposition, which should be above party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to protest against a Bill dealing with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration being shovelled through as if it were sand on a cart to be dealt with by the workmen of the Caucus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of high <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> consideration for all elements of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether it includes Government charges for services, power, communications, postage and all those things which it is within the power of the Government to vary, I wonder whether prices of that sort are envisaged in the Government’s definition which would be affected by this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power was not there, the national Government has full and adequate powers of other kinds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, this Senate, irrespective of the circumstances in which the matter arises for attention, has certain rights attaching to it as a second chamber with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations which it should always be prepared to affirm and acknowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Senate, in pursuance of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations and conscious of its role as a chamber which is concerned with the rights of the States, considered it proper that there should be consultation between the Australian Government and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not accept the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conclusions which the Government has drawn, but we recognise that ultimately in all of these matters the final determinant, and the very welcome determinant, is the voice of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But reiterating that view, as I do, I also take this opportunity to put on the record the fact that in the judgment of the Opposition in this place the Senate has not failed to pass the Bills which were introduced on 22 May last and therefore that any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advantage which may be sought by the introduction of these Bills may not avail the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, he said that he was prepared to use the rights of pensioners as a bludgeon to curtail debate upon the important matter of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum to give the power to the Commonwealth to control prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were the 1913 Bills which included the Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) 1913, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Industrial Matters) 1913, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Railway Disputes) 1913 and the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Nationalisation of Monopolies) 1913. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bill dealing with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration in regard to incomes, the Senate could deal with that also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say- and I will not quote him in full- that in his view there was no doubt that the Commonwealth Government had power to do this, and he criticised the former Government for avoiding doing it because it said it lacked the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator BYRNE  (Queensland) (9.48)-I intervene on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party at this point to indicate the attitude of the Party to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Prices) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to indicate that what the Government is doing is putting the prospect of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power before the people as an excuse or a substitute for a real policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has to be suspended because the consideration which one would suppose a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration requires has not been given to this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing illustrates better this lack of consideration and haste than that the Senate is now asked to suspend a standing order, the sole purpose of which is to allow, that contemplation, that review, that time for consideration, which ought to be given to all <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been thoughtfully put into the Standing Orders because of the unique role that the Senate plays in all <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was put in for the purpose of requiring thoughtful processes to go into the preparation of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments, just as the founding fathers in section 128 of the Constitution required that a Bill for the amendment of the Constitution, once passed its third reading stage, should not be impulsively and promptly pumped out to the public for debate tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Prices) Bill.Ihave indicated that ‘prices’ is a word which hasnot been defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to what has been put by  Senator Greenwood  I say that it seems reasonable for the short title of a- Bill which seeks to insert in section 5 1 of the Constitution the word ‘prices’ to be ‘.<span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Prices) 1973’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more and no less than would be comprehended in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in the nature of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> document to give that precision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the view of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, which was set up by this Parliament, that an amendment to the Constitution ought to be made to cover television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing to remember all the way through is that what we are dealing with is a broad power, necessarily vague because it is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legislative power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood the Attorney-General to say that he hoped, without expressing an opinion, that his interpretation would be that the price of that contract was within this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the money instalment payable under hire purchase a price within the terms of this proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the line the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  took at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention earlier this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Parliament to enact legislation such as that contained in the Bill was clarified by the very important decision of the High Court in what is known as the Concrete Pipes Case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the amending Bill in the main merely enacts in formal legislative form the de facto situation which has already come about with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This accords with the normal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of Papua New Guinea as a selfgoverning territory of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second stage which will culminate in May or June next year will be the consideration and adoption by the House of Assembly of a Constitution prepared by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Planning Committee and the subsequent amendment by this Parliament of the Papua New Guinea Act to make the Act consistent with that Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The June 1 973 meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council endorsed the views of the Papua New Guinea and Australian Governments on the role of the House of Assembly in important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council noted the agreement between the Governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea that resolutions in the House of Assembly on important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues will be by a recorded vote and by a substantial majority representative of the nation as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Bills concern the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of another country which in the Government’s view is entitled to be given control over its own destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifteen years ago the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, upon which all parties were represented, recommended that there should be an election for half the senators every time there was a general election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is completely within not only the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power but also the legislative power and ministerial responsibility of that Minister to see that Australia ‘s position in the future is safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically in answer to the honourable senator’s question, after the Senate had carried that resolution I felt that I had a responsiblity to examine the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprieties and to decide whether the Senate could convey such a message by resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I satisfied myself that it was constitutionally proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision is extremely technical in that it refers to industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, it is clear that in this case the effects of the industrial dispute are spreading beyond the borders of one State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH were concerned to work out some satisfactory resolution of what was, in essence, an industrial <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view some sort of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change will ultimately have to be faced up to if we are to solve this vexed question raised in the Moore v Doyle situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that without a grant of powers from the States or without a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment that situation is insoluble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the agreement were some kind of fraudulent agreement if might be understandablebut are not honourable senators opposite trying to impose as many difficulties, as many troubles, as many technicalities and as much doubt as they can in a field which already has enough of them because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the Senate has the authority to carry out its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I lay aside the rare provision of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change by referendum following the decision of one House alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This interference from Canberra is entirely without <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that the Tasmanian Government has the sole responsibility for this matter because it has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the absence of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to enact the reforms as law, it is open to the federal legislature to authorise the formation of a body for inquiry into law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that there will not be duplication and so that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers that the Commonwealth sought and received giving it jurisdication over the program of which this Bill is an integral part, this Government has seen fit now to introduce this Bill to provide for arrangements to be made with the States in respect of Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems and that it requires legislation at both State and Federal level in order to put into operation the policy of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well known <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fact that the only areas in which the Commonwealth can legislate are the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The June 1973 meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council endorsed the views of the Papua New Guinea and Australian Governments on the role of the House of Assembly in important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Papua New Guinea Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development which is already sitting and working in Papua New Guinea is, I believe, likely to come forward with some proposals in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second Bill is of great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance and consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unquestionably an important Bill and its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance should not be underrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of any decision by that authority which, under the Australian Constitution, has the exclusive right to determine vexing and disputed questions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, namely the High Court, it was very difficult to determine which of the 2 authorities had the appropriate jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that it is unlikely that that type of scheme will ever again be presented in this country because the Committee which the Senate appointed, virtually as the condition upon which the legislation passed through the Senate, reported that there were some aspects of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities in which the legislation was deficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate is conscious of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities within the concept of ministerial responsibility, and I believe that it would regard that matter as a fundamental matter of importance if legislation of that character was brought forward again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is alleged that the provisions of section 51 placitum 31, which requires land to be acquired on just terms, do not apply to Territories under the control of the Commonwealth and that in respect of Territories such as the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees of section 51 do not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because in those 2 Territories the Commonwealth has a plenary power, the normal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantees do not run to protect the residents of the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we cannot give residents of the Territories a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee, we believe that there is an obligation on the Parliament to ensure that a Bill applying to Territories does not set out criteria which are not just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons and because we think it is highly undesirable that one area of Australia, because it happens to come under Commonwealth jurisdiction and finds itself exempt from some other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement, should be able to have a discriminatory administrative policy in this respect, the Australian Democratic Labor Party will oppose the legislation and vote against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the legislation is rejected in this chamber, we hope that the Commonwealth will reconsider the matter and come to terms with those whose properties are already the subject of compensation discussions and those involved in the other matter and will negotiate on the proper terms in the light of what I would call the principles of equity that should prevail irrespective of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> technicalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee states in its report that it believed that the features of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) legislation to which it had taken objection arose directly because the issue of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority had not been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of petroleum resources of the off-shore seabed is not the only matter in respect of which <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, the source of authority for these provisions is unknown and will continue to be so until the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question is resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first occasion on which the question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority arose, namely, the immediate need to provide security of title in search for petroleum resources, was not taken as the  opportunity  to resolve the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must remain the situation while the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question is unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave aside questions relating to fisheries because they have an expressed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> backing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> referendum to enable the Federal Government to control both prices and incomes will be held in December and, within the past 10 months, the Federal Government has sought to restrain inflationary pressures through currency revaluation and across the board tariff cuts on imported goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps more importantly, the Committee considers that it should withhold further action on prices pending the outcome of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> referendum to be held later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for the provision of public education rests primarily with the States, as at present does the major financial commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be hard not to do so because the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> realities in Australia, whether people like it or not, are that the States have been given the power by the Constitution in relation to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened with the Schools Commission is a recognition that there is clearly a role to be played on a national basis but that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> realities are that the day to day administration of education in the States is a State function carried out by the State departments of education, with the exception of the nongovernment sector which, again, is not a direct administrative responsibility of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Senate’s right and its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility to review legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there are to be 3 other members of whom one shall be appointed by the Episcopal Conference, which was adverted to by  Senator Wheeldon  and in respect of which there would be very grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt because, as he has pointed out, it has not been approved by Archbishop Cahill, I think it is, who is the man most qualified to speak in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard suggestions at different times that there would be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge to legislation of this character as it affected independent schools, and it would appear to me that one point which would be inquired into by people opposed to independent schools would be whether aid, if it is given to schools, might be challenged under the Constitution, whereas by giving aid to children it would not perhaps be so obviously open to challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it would not be a sitting in any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legislative sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be a fair ascertainment of the views of the people concerned, again, as I say, without any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance in the sense of an operative <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legislative decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he advise the Senate whether the Government is prepared to introduce a Bill to give effect to its decision so that, if a disagreement arises between the 2 Houses of Parliament, the matter may be resolved in accordance with the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to get involved in what could be thought to be the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arguments or the relationships between the 2 Houses, but I come down on the side of a Bill and against a joint meeting on this very simple proposition: I believe that is the simplest, cleanest and best way to resolve this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas previously we argued that there were some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> barriers to a joint meeting of the 2 Houses,  Senator Murphy  now says that there would be just an expression of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  has said that it would not be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> meeting, just the determination of a consensus of opinion; that we would get together and vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in any other case the 2 Houses wish to reconcile their point of view if they are in difference, we provided for it if it is a case outside section 57 and we provided for it in a way which preserves the integrity of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to get this matter solved in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way, if we want to get it solved effectively, and if we want to get the procedure that will give the Parliament the promptest decision, I urge the Senate to reject the proposal for a joint tete-a-tete meeting at which a vote would be taken without debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for all these reasons- our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, promptness and effectiveness of decision and the appropriateness of discussion of the decision- I would urge that the Senate should not accept the resolution from the House below. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that far too much emphasis has been placed today on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meeting would have no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base whatever and would, I believe, create a precedent for future embarrassment of the Senate in its role of a House of equal strength to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A meeting of the nature suggested would decide nothing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or positive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> argument against such a leader doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not let the matter go to the next saga where in another 15 or 20 years another set of grumpy old conservatives will want to defer a decision because of some technicality or some imagined <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> precedents and historical associations which have been referred to by honourable senators who have advanced those sentiments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> factors to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that constitutionally there is only one situation in which a joint sitting of both Houses is provided for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this would not be a joint sitting in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for the provision of public education rests primarily with the States, as at present does the major financial commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States have decided, in the national interest, that, without raising questions concerning, and without derogating from, their respective <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, they should co-operate for the purpose of ensuring the legal  effeciveness  of authorities to explore for or to exploit the petroleum resources of  those  submerged lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that paragraph in the preamble the Australian Government set aside its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and entered into arrangement with the States to administer the areas off-shore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I read the conclusions to the Senate I would like to refer to the first term of reference which was:  whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation is consistent with the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation is inconsistent with what should be the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship between the Parliament and the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, in the context of broad <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities,  there  is a challenge to the exercise of the functions of Parliament in the conception of uniform legislation drafted by the executive arms of seven Australian Governments being presented to the Parliaments as a fait accompli requiring formal legislative approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This cannot be regarded as strictly inconsistent with the ‘proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities’ of the Commonwealth and the States as the power always lies  with the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States to reject or amend the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that the purpose of the mirror legislation was to use all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of Australia, wherever they may lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Committee does not regard the legislation as being inconsistent with the ‘proper responsibilities’ of the Commonwealth and the States because, as a result of a decision to avoid litigation which would have resolved the matter, it cannot say what is the measure of those proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may also be of interest to the Honourable  Senator to  learn that this matter has been referred by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention to one of its Standing Committees for discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I anticipate that such matters will comprise legal questions of all kinds arising incidentally to the Government’s legislative program, but will concentrate particularly on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senators will be aware that Professor Howard is a distinguished authority on Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Law and has written widely on the subject, as well as on many other legal matters, particularly criminal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are Bills such as the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill, which is a Bill of very great consequence because it purports to determine a very vexed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a member of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review and in that report he recommended that the Territories have representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator was good enough to refer to the fact that I was a contributor to the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the Senate was in the position of striving to maintain the purpose of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> existence as an independent expression of Australian thought, quite distinct from the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having revealed the primitive, immature, political device whereby Gough should have 2, 3 or 4 territorial accretions in this place to overcome the democratic majority which has been established in this place by an electoral vote, let us examine the reconciliation which can be made between this proposal and fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in an attempt to excuse himself and those who oppose the legislation  Senator Wright  referred to the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which sat in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review was first appointed by the two Houses of the twenty-second Parliament to review such aspects of the working of the Commonwealth Constitution as the Committee considered it could most profitably consider and to make recommendation for such amendment of the Constitution as the Committee thought necessary in the light of experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very important that we should remind the people of Australia who were the members of that Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that occasion I used the opportunity to quote quite extensively from the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> discussions which ultimately resulted in the initiation of an Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright said that we should not be upsetting the fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood  took this a little further and said that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation is that senators represent people in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight the Government is relying on the Constitution and is putting forward a perfectly <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation to meet the times in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position perfectly well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and other legal work is facing the Government at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that there are a number of referendum proposals and that the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is still continuing its work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it quite plain that I will oppose any joint meeting of the Parliament to decide this matter or any matter other than a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will do so for a number of reasons: It has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does appear to me, firstly, that it does not import into this suggestion a type of meeting that is contemplated in the Constitution and only for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis will come out of such a meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Byrne’s amendment because I think it eliminates the qualms that honourable senators may have had in relation to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Parliament to enact legislation such as that contained in the Bill was clarified by the very important decision of the High Court in what is known as the Concrete Pipes Case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to  Senator James  McClelland in his capacity as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it takes up the proposal foreshadowed by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  at the recent <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney, and it takes up the recommendation, dating back as far as 1958, of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other is a special provision for senators whose terms, as to half, commenced on 1 July 1971 and as to the other half will commence on 1 July 1 974, each of whom would in accordance with the existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions have a 6-year term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed under the transitional arrangement that a currently sitting senator, whose term began in 1971 and would in accordance with present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision expire in 1977, will continue in office until the second House of Representatives election after the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration comes into force, that is, until 1978 unless there is a double dissolution or early election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will mean, in normal circumstances and, of course, excluding any senators elected to fill casual vacancies, that the senators serving when the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration becomes law could have a term of up to about seven and a half years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be dealt with in such a way that if there were a rejection the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes could operate so that the Government could then bring them into the House of Representatives again in ample time before the Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in September this year in Sydney, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said on behalf of the Australian Government that we would propose to the Parliament, for decision by the people, an amendment of the Constitution which would write into it the principle of substantial equality of electoral divisions for all the Parliaments of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applying similar <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions, the United States Supreme Court has, for the last 9 years and more, declared any form of malapportionment within a state to be unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the more recent <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the recent <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention the Prime Minister said perhaps the most important amendment that could be achieved for 1973 and beyond would be an amendment to do just thismake it possible for the Australian Government to borrow directly on behalf of local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in the normal development of the processes of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy and the processes of parliamentary democracy the wishes of one chamber are not acceded to by the other chamber then the other chamber has its options as to what it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are there because the Government in its wisdom wanted to hear the whole of the people from that part of the educational spectrum but it did not want to have its choice limited to the nominations of the Episcopal Conference, quite apart from any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties which might arise under section 1 16 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that I adverted to this matter in the debate on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Prices) Bill on 26 September last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one of those who believe this justifies the absence in Australia of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and statutory guarantees of those rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideally, in my view, a Bill of Rights should be written into the Australian Constitution and I proposed at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney that this be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the absence of a constitutionally entrenched Bill of Rights, it is proposed that those rights should be set out in legislation of this Parliament, so far as it is within the powers of the Parliament to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in August 1972, Professor Wootten, now  Mr Justice  Wootten, provided a forceful answer to this concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing could be more in line with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation of the Commonwealth Parliament and the States than the proposed preface. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is quite important that the Senate should look to the Karmel Committee report and particularly to 2 sections of it which spell out quite clearly the recognition of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation that education is and should remain a primary function of the States and also that there is an overriding virtue in decentralisation and devolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> responsibility for the provision of public education rests primarily with the States, as at present does the major financial commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those quotations and many others from the Karmel Committee report are allied with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> realities of the day we are describing precisely the amendment which the Opposition proposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to this I would again draw upon the Karmel Committee report which in a great number of places relied on and gave great emphasis to the importance, as the Committee saw it, of the considerations of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for the provision of public education rests primarily with the States, as at present does the major financial commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree with the suggestion just made by  Senator James  McClelland when he said that there is a clear <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power for the Government to do the things it wants to do and that this legislation would break down that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out the Minister himself repeatedly said in his second reading speech and the Karmel Committee said at page  132  of its report that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility does lie primarily with the States as does the present commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After exhaustive investigation, the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1958, and again in 1959, recognised the vital interest of the people in proposed <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee’s proposal would not disturb the Federal fabric of the Constitution, inherent in section 128, but its proposal would serve to lay more emphasis on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> change by the democratic process of majority vote than there at present exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the two-thirds majority is unreasonably high and, given that we have not gone beyond the original 6 States, means in the elegant words of the Constitution Review Committee that ‘for every State in which there is an adverse vote there must be a favourable vote in two states … a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> change has to be supported not only by a majority of States but by two-thirds of the States. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this change will bring the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions more into accord with the spirit of the founders in 1901; more into accord with today’s mood of national awareness; and more into accord with democratic principles and processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to remove the anomaly that Australian citizens in our mainland Territories have no voice or vote in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electors of the Territories may be thought to have an added claim to voting in national referendums on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electors of the Territories may in this sense be able to contribute their informed judgment on many of the matters likely to be the subject of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 4 proposals will be joined later by a further proposal foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on 8 November 1973 and also in the week immediately following the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am using <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not sound like the use of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means, does it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course that will rest upon the financial structure which will support the activities and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Great moves are operating in Australia today at the instance of the Federal Government for further control by it over areas of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has been convened at the instance of 2 State governments- certainly the Government of Victoria- and it will look at the whole question of control over finances by Commonwealth, State and local authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am looking forward to the results of the deliberations of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention so that as Australia moves into the next 30 years we can have a completely new distribution of power, so that the States no longer will feel themselves to be mendicants at the table of the Commonwealth and so that the Commonwealth will know at any time in view of its new international responsibilities just where it is going, where its areas of power, clearly and undisputably will lie and the States will have not only the responsibility for certain things but will have the means at their disposal without having to resort to alternative sources of finance by way of annual agreements or special approaches to finance their duties within the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always taken the view that that decision should be the decision of Parliament and not of the Executive Government and certainly not of an unconstitutional assembly of members of both Houses and not of a joint meeting of members of both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except in the very exceptional case to solve deadlocks after an election in section 57, the Senate and House of Representatives operate separately in their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think that such a statement would carry with it the Committees of the Parliament, although I think that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> clause refers to committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that provides the opportunity for the other House, where the Attorney-General’s view is assured of prevailing on a matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law to bring before us such modifications when the Bill is returned to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly we have in the spirit and practice of co-operative federalism in many spheres of government learned in recent years how to overcome any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties that may arise in regard to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that it will probably take some years and some number of cases in the High Court fully to resolve the actual ambit of this legislation and decide the actual <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any other spheres of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation where new areas of power are being tested in the High Court, years and years of litigation have been involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If senators believe that by passing this Act and sending the matter to the High Court the problem can be solved in one case I believe that senators are flying in the face of all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal experience that we have had over 70 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is legislation which points up the extremely important and interesting aspect of both international and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law and, further, the evaluation of the commercial interests which may rest in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when referring to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the proposed legislation the report states at page 7: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that point the Committee was looking at a term of reference which related to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation to which we had given our attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to this term of reference depends basically upon what is meant by the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To approach the question in this way would be tacitly to treat as inevitable and not undesirable the very <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> battles that it was the wish of the Commonwealth and the States to avoid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed his view on that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an argument based on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fight which may follow if this Bill is passed, I believe that one should look to the view expressed by  Mr Good,  Q.C., who was Solicitor-General of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I state, firstly, that I exclude any reference to bays and inlets because I think the Bill makes clear that it has nothing whatever to do with altering the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power affecting them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They just took a piece of legislation that had been devised by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advisers of the States in conference and adopted it, and thought that they were legislating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chief purpose of this was to avoid a decision on where the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to deal with the petroleum resources lay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One the Committee itself identified in saying, when considering whether the legislation was consistent with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conceptions that underlay the responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, that in the legislation it was impossible to identify any Minister who, vis-a-vis this Parliament, had responsibility, and vis-a-vis the Victorian Parliament any Minister who in respect of the Western Australian off-shore oil had responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that for us to go meddling about with petroleum resources under a legislative outfit like that is primitive indeed and completely different from any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conceptions that I have ever envisaged as being written into or implied in the Commonwealth Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we proceed from the merely <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect to the practical I believe that more importantly the legislation arbitrarily divided the sea bed into segments by projecting State boundaries out into the sea bed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that it is not to our credit that following the 1967 legislation and the report of the Committee which was finally delivered in December 1971 the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues have not been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision that says that the sovereignty of the territorial sea is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth does not exclude consistent lawslaws of the State that are consistent with laws of the Commonwealth made in the course of exercising its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes that the features of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) legislation to which it has taken objection arise directly because the issue of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority has not been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not in the national interest ultimately for questions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority where uncertainty exists to be put aside- in fact to the exclusion of effective Parliamentary decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all the plea which is made, for all the acknowledgement which is inherent in the second reading of this Bill that this is an area where <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority should be resolved, the practical requirements require a co-operative arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Winter was the most competent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and economic authority available to report to the Government on power over prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For various other reasons there is a fount of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In welcoming them he said that he was delighted to greet the representatives of a Parliament and of a nation which to him represented the ideal form of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government- the ideal being that it was a nation with one Parliament and with one House of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was blatant dictatorship of centralist government and bureaucratic directive which are quickly destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric of the States’ sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some months ago I was cynical of the outcome of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that it is merely an accident- a fortuitous accident- that somebody suggested to  Mr Whitlam  that he go for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum on prices and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why in a debate upon the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> concentration of power in this country it is appropriate to call attention to it today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the weight, seriousness and the sheer number of the Bills which the Senate is being asked to considerBills that affect the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in Australia, Bills that affect the social order in Australia, Bills that affect domestic relations in Australia, Bills that affect the national health scheme and things like that- and matters, such as the Trade Practices Bill, that concern the commercial life and the trade union life of Australia, it must be realised that these things are of such moment that to try to deal with them ad hoc in the quick rush towards the end of a session would be unthinkable and indefensible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications of this legislation- I will deal with this in more detail later in my speech- are far-reaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise the question of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications associated with the Bill that are extremely dangerous, and it seems appropriate that a more detailed examination of them should be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While referring to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications of the Bill, I refer to the appointment of Professor Colin Howard as a legal counsel to the AttorneyGeneral recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> adviser to  Senator Murphy,  Professor Howard can be expected to take a strong line on the need for the Government to fully exploit the Constitution when legislating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issues should in no way be obscured by putting considerations to the people as if this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration depended upon specific legislative measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know, of course, whether they would get through Parliament, but when the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power is available to the national Parliament it ought to be given proper consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Is it not a fact that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in Sydney in the first week of September this year the Commonwealth Government agreed that numerous topics suggested as involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment should be referred to standing committees of the Convention for detailed consideration and report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What future, therefore, does the Commonwealth Government see in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I am not not mistaken the Australian Government made the position clear that by taking part in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention it was not to be taken as entering on a course which would inhibit it from proposing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes or legislative measures of any kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian Parliament wishes to use its present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to propose matters for the consideration of the people by way of referendum it is entitled to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the price of going to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention is that the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament are to be paralysed, the honourable senator would see that it would be very difficult for any government to agree to participate in such a convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recollect that on Tuesday of this week I read to the Senate a letter that I received from the  Speaker  of the Parliament of Queensland and that I explained my reasons for doing so as being that the Senate had a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no need for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum to ensure that simultaneous elections are held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal reason why the Government should not take out the House of Representatives at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that it is possible for the Government to co-ordinate the election of both houses without a referendum and without <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This committee was supposed to represent a formidable approach to the issue of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But undoubtedly the pre-occupation of the proponents of that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review program was, in some way, to make the Senate conform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I stand here and remind myself of the arguments that persuaded me in 1959 to dissent from the views of the other eleven, it is not much wonder that I stood my ground because as I restate the arguments I am more than ever convinced that the Senate needs the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> stability and safeguards to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise briefly to expound a point of view which although not very much listened to in this place is, I am sure, appreciated by those who out of principle make <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> study their preoccupation, that it is necessary that we remind ourselves from time to time of the reasons why these differences exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I just pause for a little silent pity towards the author of this proposal; and the more so when I reflect on how he has masqueraded as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> constructor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention was in the wind when he came into office, and he said he would support it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just want to reinforce what he said by reference to the way the convolutions of  Mr Whitlam  ‘s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> mind go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has come forward out of Caucus, not with a proposal to control incomes as was agreed to about prices, but a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal with respect to incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the second contribution by  Mr Whitlam  to this process of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  has made a couple of proposals and he says: ‘We might do a little more of this making <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the proposal that this Bill be subjected to the scrutiny of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one House declines to pass a referendum Bill which has been passed by the other House, after the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interval the matter can be put directly to the people so that this kind of obstruction cannot prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to shelve it, as we will no doubt shelve the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The newly elected Government has pressed for and secured direct representation for local government on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Covention which met for the first time in the middle of this year and which intends to consider various <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, the Prime Minister secured the agreement of the leaders of five of the State delegations that the Australian and State governments should come together to consider amending the financial agreement that is referred to in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister indicated that if this could not be agreed to he would seek the necessary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment of section 105a. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States have a separate interest to be protected with respect to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, and it is up to the Senate, composed of senators elected on a State-wide franchise, to ensure that the State interest is protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to alter the provision concerning the alteration of the Constitution to 3 States from the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement of four appears to me to be a denial of the concept of the banding together of a series of colonies and States into a federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would mean that, if a majority of the people- we wish to extend that from a majority of the people in the States to a majority of the whole of the people of Australia, whether in the Territories or in the States- were in favour of a proposal and at least half of the States were to vote for the proposal, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum would be taken to be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems at the moment, I would hope that we can look to the day when we will have the one system of courts with the High Court as the apex and that there will be no Commonwealth system of courts existing alongside the State Supreme Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to support education is probably limited to helping finance the inculcation of knowledge which is, in a religious sense, neutral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly, in view of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which has been convened, which has sat already and is continuing its deliberations, it would be inappropriate if the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relations of the Commonwealth were allowed to be redetermined and redefined, as no doubt they will be in some areas if the recommendations of that Convention are adopted, and it would be inappropriate if at the same time the diversity of law were allowed to continue without interruption and the systems were allowed to continue to develop in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think everyone would agree that a person who has publicly identified himself against a particular <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> view would, from a commonsense point of view, hardly be likely to be the person selected to present a case on behalf of the Commonwealth in favour of that view of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following debate on 12 April 1973 the Bill was referred, on the motion of  Senator Rae,  to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs reported and the debate resumed on 30 May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Bill was before the Senate previously, the Senate directed that it be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- The Government opposes the deferment of further consideration of this legislation because it believes that it has responded to the criticism by the Opposition and to the points which were made by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, I am in good company in saying this because  Senator Wright,  in his dissenting report associated with the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959, said, when speaking of proposals to amend the constitution of the Senate: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Does the Leader of the Government accept as a fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle that there is in a government of our type a unity whereby the actions and speeches of any one member are speeches and actions on behalf of the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem which arises is that the Commonwealth has no power other than the power it has in respect of people whom it has a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to look after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like  Senator Davidson,  I should like to know whether it is intended to direct- and, of course, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth to direct is somewhat hedged around in matters of this nature- incoming migrants to this Albury-Wodonga area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the original justification remains valid, notwithstanding that there may now be no particular burden of original jurisdiction, other than in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court will be left free to continue its great work as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and appeals court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To continue those courts avoids any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem that might attend upon the abolition of a court created by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> barriers which would prevent the Tribunal from making determinations relating to remuneration of judges and salaries of Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in November 1971 I moved a motion, which was carried by this Senate, that there be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry the matter of ‘the law and administration of divorce, custody and family matters, with particular regard to oppressive costs, delays, indignities and other injustices ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons already referred to, this cannot apply to persons ordered to pay maintenance under an affiliation order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs will itself wish to examine the Bill in detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has before it this other major investigation which it will conduct in the month of February so that it can report back to the Senate in March, it would not be altogether appropriate that this Bill similarly should go to that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the actions of the present Labor Government in attempting to destroy the federal structure of Australia and replace it with a unitary and centralist structure is detrimental to the individual Australian and if continued will destroy the basis of the Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That available <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means under the trade and commerce powers be called upon to effect this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-10-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power resolutely to press its program to fulfilment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her Majesty said that we would introduce legislation to fill <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities with respect to banking, insurance and financial corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this in mind Liberal Party senators noted with pleasure the Queen’s statement for the Prime Minister that his Government intends to pursue its policies to the utmost by using its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers resolutely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Political commentators would have us believe that this statement about using <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers constituted a threat by the Prime Minister of a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words would make more sense if directed by the Prime Minister to his Caucus, for I would imagine that if Caucus makes the Prime Minister back down on many more issues he just might use his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to take them all back to the electorate, even if some of them would be left swinging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is now taking the tack of emphasising that his program for the next 6 months is directed towards <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being conscious that he cannot achieve unification by direct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means, he is setting out to achieve unification little by little, in the hope that he will disintegrate the State forces and will have substituted for them regional areas which will become dependent upon his direct largess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, he is indulging in that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process to avoid the obvious criticism which comes from not taking up a challenge of a double dissolution on matters of high priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this proposal came out of the deliberations of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee in 1959 of which, I think, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and I are the only remaining members in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that honourable senators on this side are suggesting is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes laid down be observed and that they should not be dented or perverted to suit the whim or the convenience of an impulsive government which, in another place this afternoon, was so unenthusiastic about another <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal that it could not whip up the required <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Senate will insist upon <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> methods, patient and objective reasoning, and will thoughtfully put these matters to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this proposal is adopted by the people that game will be over and the oversight of these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations will be taken by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 4 December 1973 the Senate referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill; rejected the Constitution Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill; rejected the Constitution Alteration (Local Government Bodies) Bill; amended the Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill, amendments which were rejected by the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is invoking the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has sent the Bill to this chamber and the Government is going to take advantage of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision which allows the Government, which has the majority in the House of Representatives, to see to it that such a measure gets to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us send it off to a committee or do some trickery or use some device so that we can prevent the people having their say on these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions at the next Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we insist on that, we insist on strict compliance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that it is not a very good day for democracy when the Opposition parties, after having so decisively rejected this measure, which was simply a measure to put the proposition to the people, now, again, in March- when the Government is proceeding as expeditiously as it can to fulfil the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements- are pretending that they need time to make up their minds or to debate the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This follows the procedure which the Opposition suggested and which the Senate acceded to on the occasion when the last <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration Bill was discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these referendum Bills deal with matters which properly should await the recommendations of committees established by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition thinks that in some way this action will sprag the Government’s program, because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reference to the 2 months requirement with respect to this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I saw a statement in the Canberra Times’ that the Government has had a good look at the matter and is satisfied and confident that the time factors will be just right and; that it has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to assure it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 4 December the Senate referred the Bill to its Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That’, insert ‘in the opinion of this Senate, it would be a travesty of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and parliamentary practice if this Bill, which so vitally affects the powers and independence of this Senate, were to be rushed through the parliamentary processes and submitted to the people without the most careful examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the Senate election, the Government proposes to intrude into that election a proposal for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened to  Senator Greenwood  working himself up into a lather of indignation at the way in which we had treated the Senate committees by recommitting this proposal in the face of the fact that the Opposition had had the numbers to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when it was last before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anybody in the Senate seriously believe that the reason why the Opposition referred this matter to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was for it to get more serious consideration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One imagines that it would have sat down and looked at the history of proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Opposition does not want to give the Australian people a say on this or other matters of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is prepared to let the people have a say on any matter which he thinks requires <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put this simple propositon to  Senator Wriedt  who is the senior Minister in the Senate chamber at the moment: If the argument is that merely because a Bill passes through the House of Representatives twice with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> majority it has to go to the people because that is democracy, will he - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government proposition is that merely because a Bill to alter the Constitution passes through the House of Representatives twice by a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> majority it can- it does not have to betherefore be submitted by the Governor-General to the electorate, and that that is democracy, will the Government give an unqualified undertaking that should the Senate twice, by an absolute majority, pass a Bill to alter the Constitution, even though that Bill should be rejected, laid aside or amended unacceptably in another place, the Prime Minister will advise the GovernorGeneral also to submit the proposition contained in that Bill to the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment commences by stating that it would be a travesty of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and parliamentary practice if this Bill, which so vitally affects the powers and independence of this Senate, were to be rushed through the proper parliamentary processes and submitted to the people without the most careful examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government feels that the present restrictive <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers are not in the best interests of the good government of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party believes that the proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations are necessary and in the best interests of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 4 December 1973 the call of the Senate was dispensed with in respect of the 4 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills which were before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes that this Bill, along with several other proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments already submitted to this Parliament, will be put to the people by referendum at the time of the forthcoming Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Bdi is a Bill to amend the Constitution, but it requires the approval of the electors in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that, during the first meeting of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in September last year, heads of delegations agreed in principle that the Constitution should be altered to allow for interchanges of powers and to remove the existing doubts about the operation of the present power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been settled in consultation with the parliamentary counsel of the States as was foreshadowed at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relevant standing committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention was also given the opportunity of commenting on a draft of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that these provisions will encourage the States to refer to this Parliament powers such as family law, defamation and shipping and navigation which, in this context, have been raised at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was raised at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a proposal in respect of some alteration of the Constitution is put up in this chamber honourable senators opposite say: ‘ It should be discussed at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we bring forward a proposal that has been discussed at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and in respect of which a great deal of consultation has been had with the parliamentary counsel of the States and so on, honourable senators opposite are not even prepared to proceed with the second reading of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a document wholly prepared and written by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and delivered, of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> necessity, by  Her  Majesty the Queen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queen, as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State, has no responsibility whatsoever as to the content of the document and no capacity for discretionary veto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queen has honoured us by conducting the opening ceremony as our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarch, even though she was forced by her advisers to deliver a speech of apalling twaddle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was forced by her <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advisers to deliver a speech of a highly party political nature, a speech written by  Mr Freudenburg  and approved by  Mr Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to mention very briefly 3 matters which have been referred to in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers),  namely the attack on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and the responsibilities of those rights by the present administration, the rural industries and, finally, defence policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it the present Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is looking at these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that a wise government would withhold its attacks upon the States until such time as the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention reported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the people of this country will consider these proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations, which we understand will be presented at the next Senate election, and give them the same kind of treatment as was meted out to the prices and incomes referenda last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Her  Majesty opened this Second Session of the Twenty-eighth Parliament she said that she was particularly pleased to perform personally an important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty as Queen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on 4 December 1973 for report back to the Senate no later than the first day of sitting after 1 February 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I claim that we were fulfilling our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligation and our obligation to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no need for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum to ensure that simultaneous elections are held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal reason why the Government should not take out the House of Representatives at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I believe that the Prime Minister is moving step by step to remove first one, and then the other, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objection hoping that the people will not see his real object until it is too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an election is held in May this year the average citizen in Victoria, for example, will be asked to look at the names of fifteen or sixteen Senate candidates and at the same time cast a responsible vote on another five or six <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that  Mr Whitlam  whimsically puts forward in a display of his passion for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration is that on each occasion when a casual dissolution takes place in the House of Representatives there is to be a dissolution of half of the Senate, and that half should go to election just so that the elections of the 2 chambers can be synchonised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  has the honour of being the only remaining member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review still in the Parliament other than myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is being put forward here is that the Senate should become an echo of the House of Representatives by going to elections every time the House of Representatives finds it proper in accordance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice- to which I have referred- to go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that  Mr Whitlam  during his parliamentary career played a major role in drawing up the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review of which he was a member from 1956 and from 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But from the point of view of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> values it weakens the Senate to a significant degree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does the Government put forward the proposition but also it is not content to put it forward in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 the proposition had been examined by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A committee of the Senate was set up for the purpose of getting <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> scholars, professors, students of political science and noted parliamentarians to deliver views of their experience and knowledge as to the value of the elements of the Senate which this Bill threatens to destroy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is not in order from the point of view of ordinary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes, because the people who accepted the Constitution in 1900 laid down with great particularity and emphasis the means whereby the Constitution should be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  asserts that when we referred this Bill to our <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee in December, we failed to pass it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GREENWOOD (Victoria)  .36)- This Bill proposes a referendum on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that only half the senators come out at any given time, but that will be the position irrespective of whether a referendum proposal, which requires that the synchronisation of elections should be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement, is carried or whether half the Senate comes out at the time that the House of Representatives election is held, which has been the general but not universal pattern of the elections which have been held since we have had a federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wright  indicated, the reasons why half the Senate would be called to an election would not be based upon the Senate’s performance or on any sound or established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> criteria, but simply as a reaction to, an inevitable result of, what was happening internally within the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That again, I believe, is a tendency likely to flow from a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that the 2 Houses should be elected at the one time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition challenge the right of the Prime Minister to ignore the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions relating to putting questions by way of referendum in the way he is doing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was resolved, contrary to the clear wishes of the Government as expressed by me, that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report to the Senate as soon as possible but not later than the first sitting day after 1 February 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion the Senate’s action in sending the proposed law to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on 4 December 1973, particularly when construed in the light of the failure of the Committee to meet to consider the matter, constituted a failure to pass the proposed law within the meaning of section 128 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is within its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> province if it does any of those things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion is made that an examination of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions shows that before it may be said that those provisions are invoked a breach of duty by the Senate must be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change which seeks only to affect access to loan funds change the structure of local government bodies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly we have the situation where the Government has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to say to any local government or, as they are now called regions, how it will spend that money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has been operating and holding discussions for more than 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I cannot accept the Government’s sincerity because the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has not, as yet, reached any conclusions on local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the Liberals: believe it is essential that local government should be properly represented at next year’s <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One point was that local government should have representatives at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have here a list of the representatives of local government who attended the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>AUSTRALIAN <span class="highlight">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> CONVENTION 1973 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was not all this laid out before the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of 1973? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The local government people had this to say in their submission to the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read again from the local government submission to the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Milliner’s remarks have emanated from the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important and forceful was made in 19S9 by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to accept the argument put yesterday by the Government senators that we would be acting undemocratically in not allowing the proposal to go to the people then I ask this quesiton and I would like to hear the comments of Government senators on this proposition when they reply: If a Bill which would submit a proposal for an alteration of the Constitution to the people should pass through the Senate with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> majority of 31 votes, go to the House of Representatives, and be rejected and then, after an interval of 3 months, again be passed by the Senate with a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> majority of 3 1 votes, would the Government give an absolute undertaking that it would advise the Governor-General to submit that proposal to the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is good <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law that a proposal, from whichever side it comes, is submitted to the people as a result of advice tendered by the Executive Council to the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been asked to approve a series of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills which have been shown in debate to be unacceptable in that broadly they represent a plunder of State rights and an attempt to centralise power in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a misconception in his mind as to the role the Senate is required to play in relation to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not apply in respect of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense you would be saying that if you took the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision set out in section 23 of the Constitution and applied it, the question would be carried because there was the simple majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would give effect to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions ought to have been more closely observed when drafting the Standing Orders and I hope that we can clear them up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expression requires consideration so that the position of this House will be made clear to those who have responsibility for the subsequent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes so that they may know whether to act with or without reference to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But then we come to standing order 242.I submit that the only construction that you can give to that, if you adhere to prevailing rulings as to the reconciliation between section 23 of the Constitution and the standing order which requires an absolute majority either to pass the third reading of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bill or to suspend Standing Orders, is to disregard the second sentence of standing order 242.I say that if you continue to apply the rulings that have been given on the standing order on suspension of Standing Orders, because it has been held that on the passage of a simple majority, notwithstanding the standing order requirement of an absolute majority, the simple majority prevailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put that to you,  Mr President,  because I can foresee that if the Government does not wish to take the opinion of the judicial structure, the Governor-General may request that that be done, such, I believe, is the complication on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter in which the processes of today have involved us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  President  of the Senate I cannot attempt, nor should I attempt, to predict what would be the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> opinion of others who are not within the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later in his speech, while referring to the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review and the Supreme Court of the United States, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so I am not deterred in any way by the argument repeatedly advanced on behalf of the Government in this chamber, in the course of this debate and earlier debates on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills, that somehow or other it is none of the business of the Senate, one of the 2 Houses of Parliament, to deter or impede the Government in putting its suggestions for alteration of the Constitution to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that electorates in this country will be drawn up on the basis of that feature and not on the basis of the actual right to be an elector, namely, being an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said that this measure is in a different category from the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is in a different category from the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that by reason of that omnibus resolution which has just been agreed to for the reconstitution of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the reference to that Committee in December 1973 of the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill which, by the said resolution, is now made a reference again to the Committee, we have a nice pot of porridge of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> mixture similar to that which was discussed this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are Yes and No cases to be issued in the accustomed manner for the proposed referenda on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leave out all words after ‘that’, insert ‘the Bill be deferred until after consideration has been given to its proposals by all State Governments and by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in Sydney last September the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  indicated, following the question being raised by the New South Wales <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The course of events since the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last September was for the States and the Commonwealth to arrange for the parliamentary draftsmen of each of the governments to meet together to consider the terms of a proposed amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was promised at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention 6 months ago so it would be a gross breach of faith if the Opposition parties in the Senate were to delay that Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that in this chamber the views of all senators ought to count and ought to be heard on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment of this character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Together with my colleagues from the other States I agreed last year that the Services of our parliamentary draftsmen would be made available to assist in the preparation of a draft Bill relating to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to provide for an interchange of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, unless something unusual occurs the general pattern which prevails at <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referenda will prevail on this occasion also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any proposal has the prospect of support by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, by all parties in Parliament, by State governments and State oppositions and by the people, I believe it should be divorced from the situation in which hotly contentious issues are submitted at a referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment which has been proposed is designed to defer this Bill until it has been considered by all State governments and by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention should have the opportunity of examining a proposal which, after all, emanated from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal bids fair- if the text can be agreed upon by the various parties involved- to have the support of that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This uncertainty, particularly in recent years, has given rise to a desire on the part of the States to have the matter clarified by some legislative <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change as is now envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is ample reason why the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention ought to be given an opportunity to examine this matter so that if it is to have approval ultimately it will be aired in the best forum in which approval can be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have moved the amendment which requests that the Bill be deferred until after consideration has been given to its proposals by all State governments and by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the motion for the second reading of the Bill the Senate Opposition has moved that all words after That’ be deleted and that the following words be inserted:  the Bill be deferred until after consideration has been given to its proposals by all State governments and by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position appears to be that some support in principle for the idea of an interchange of powers was made at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, but no reference of this Bill with its specific content has been made to the individual States and no attempt has been made to get the States to agree or disagree with the substantive content of the proposed new sections 108a or 108b. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I support entirely the need for its deferment until the matter is looked at again by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He raised his views, and the views of the Government, on this matter very strongly and convincingly at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which was held in Sydney in September last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delegates from the States, from local government and from this National parliament expressed in one way or another a need for the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention or for a referendum to determine these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to stress the fact that this Government has endeavoured to refer matters of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change to the Australian people, not to make some back door arrangement, not to attempt to bypass public opinion, but rather to give the Australian people an opportunity to have a 1970 look at the Constitution, which people should know is now well over 70 years old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is seeking to extend it, and I think I have indicated that in his desire to do this he will be recognised not only by the Australian people but ultimately by historians as a person who was prepared to go to the full extent of the democratic procedures to convince the Australian electorate to change the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions relating to powers between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the view that was expressed at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention by the Victorian Premier,  Mr Hamer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that all the referendums that have been put to the people have been rejected by the people because they did not want any disturbance in any major way of the existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the States and the Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite natural that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Sydney the Premiers said to the Prime Minister: ‘That is a very good idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last week we have been engaged in discussing various proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform which the Government wishes to put before the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangement, as provided by section 5 1 placitum (xxxvii) is that the parliaments of the States may refer powers to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment is to enable the Australian Government to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this is the way this offer was interpreted by the representatives of the States which were present at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what may be said by  Senator Greenwood  about alleged attempts by the Prime Minister to mislead the public about the attitude of the States to this offer, I refer him to the report of the proceedings before the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which I believe  Senator Greenwood  along with myself attended on the relevant day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention the Prime Minister floated this idea and referred specifically to the instances which I have given and he evoked the responses from the representatives of the States to which I am about to refer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Prime Minister at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventionwhich as I say was attended by  Senator Greenwood  and myself- sat down, having said the things which I have just quoted,  Sir Robert  Askin, representing New South Wales said, among other things: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody, including the most profound <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, who could tell me, after reading what  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  said, whether he agreed or disagreed, is a better man than I am. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention broke up it set up various committees one of which was designed specifically to consider the fine print and the detail of this proposition for mutual interchange of powers between the Australian Government and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we asking the Parliament of Australia to make some drastic and permanent alteration to our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been discussed by a committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We get an amendment which says that the Bill should be deferred until after consideration has been given to its proposals by all State governments and by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been settled in consultation with the parliamentary counsel of the States as was foreshadowed at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was accepted in principle at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now I shall read to the Senate from a statement made by the  chairman  of a committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which examined the proposals in detail and expressed its reservations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the Government demanding that we race straight to the people after there has been a broad agreement of principle following the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to see this issue marketed by the Government like soap powder, without reference to the States, because quite obviously the  chairman  of a committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which was looking into this matter, does not agree and is recommending that it should be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The genesis of this proposed amendment to the Constitution appears to have been a discussion which took place at a dinner during the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this very informal manner an alleged agreement was made between the Prime Minister and those Premiers that in principle they agreed to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment by which the interchange of powers between the Commonwealth and State parliaments would be facilitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the occasion was the holding of the first sessions of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government senators have said in this debate, as they have said over and over again when speaking on other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration legislation, that somehow or other the Senate is not really entitled to consider independently or to oppose Bills which provide for the alteration of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How naive is the proposition which was put this afternoon by  Senator James  McClelland that we, with that responsibility on our shoulders, should simply say that, even though we may be opposed to a particular <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, even though we may believe that this is a matter that should be given further consideration, and even though it is a matter which perhaps vitally affects the States and which the State governments and the State parliaments should be given the opportunity to discuss before it is put to the people, we should not give any consideration or weight to these things; we should simply pass this Bill through the Senate without exercising any of the responsibilities and judgment which, as I said, are placed upon our shoulders by the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to amend the Constitution in this Bill is, in my view, a very minor question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, it is a proposal which- I hesitate to say it- emanated from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, although that body has not properly considered it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be in the process of considering it, but at this stage it is merely a proposal which emanated from the informal meeting which took place at the time of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention between the Prime Minister and 5 of the 6 State Premiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does leave one with an uneasy feeling as to why this Bill should now be rushed on by the Government ahead of all the other major questions for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment which are being discussed by a committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are left with this measure, supported only in principle by the Premiers of 5 States- a principle which is still being considered by a  Committee  of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and which was, as I said, a relatively minor issue before that Convention by comparison with many other major <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes which are under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, I point to the absence of any such agreement, the absence of urgency in this matter and the fact that this measure is one of many being considered by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons I intend to support the amendment that the Bill be deferred until proper consideration has been given to it by all State governments and in particular by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I am prepared to consider having a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment which will give some power from the Commonwealth Parliament to State Parliaments. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore I believe it is again trying to hoodwink some of the State Premiers or State Opposition leaders into believing that under this proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration the States will gain some benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not really in a meaningful way to provide for a 2-way process as the Government represents in the hope of getting support from the States and in the hope of softening them up for many other major <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes designed to transfer more and more power from the States to the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, this Parliament is given a very definitive place and role in the presentation and passage of a proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Constitution contemplates that this chamber could pass a Bill for a proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment and it could go to the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate had insisted on the Bill and passed it again, it would have been within the ability of this chamber to present its proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to the Governor-General for presentation to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is important that the people should know that this chamber, approaching this matter as it does, has discharged a high <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that any honourable senator who thinks otherwise in relation to the passage of this Bill completely misconceives his individual duty and completely misconceives the role that the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Parliament at large must play in the presentation and passage of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the people realise that as we consider this Bill and other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bills in depth and at leisure and examine them in this prior way before they go to the people we are discharging our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is an obligation on all senators not merely to use a political ploy which would have the effect of destroying the effective participation, constitutionally contemplated, of this chamber in the passage of referenda proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After discussions with the States and at a major conference in Sydney, the Government has decided that the Commonwealth should have power to give back to the States certain matters that come within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth Government at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators know that the States have the power to refer to the Commonwealth certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights that we now have but did not enjoy at the time of Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are giving the States and the people a chance to stand on their feet and say that this is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration they desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> in that it believes that its objectives must be attained by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> utilisation of Federal, State and local governments; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 12 September last year the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers following the September meeting of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, advising that the Attorney-General would be in touch with State Attorneys as to arrangements for draftsmen to consider the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Prime Minister gave a very good example- this was touched upon by  Senator James  McClelland in the very good contribution that he made to this debate- during the course of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention when he said in instancing these powers: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Australian Government has been seeking to bring in this legislation, I might say, on the original suggestion of the New South Wales delegation to the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last week that same type of gimmick has been evident in the title of each of the Bills which propose that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration questions be put to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been evident in so many matters, even those relating to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions that we see put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate has certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appreciate and I accept that, as he says, where there are matters in which the Senate is constitutionally involved the Senate ought to be consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case the Senate has deliberately taken itself out of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Government has pleaded for consideration from the Opposition on the ground that for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and other reasons he may have to fit in with time schedules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in the unitary system in a country of British origins the judicial system is of very great importance, but in a federal system it is of unique importance inasmuch as there is entrusted to the judicial courts a determination of <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> powers as between Federal and State parliaments and instrumentalities, and citizens’ rights dependent upon different laws have to be adjudicated upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kinds of litigation are defined by reference to factors which for the most part relate either to the character of the litigants or to the question of law arising; e.g., that the litigants are residents of different States, or that the Commonwealth is a party, or that a resident of one State sues another State, that the litigation raises a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question, or that it arises under a law of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions in truth sacrifice the interests of the litigant to the desire of the framers of the Constitution to preserve to the High Court the power of giving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rulings and making <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> precedents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  Honour cited various difficulties that arose and at page 101 showed how, by raising matters within the description of sections 75 and 76- the same description as is applied in clause 19 of the Bill - your adversary can delay you and can raise a new point of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many lawyers of very considerable repute believe that the establishment of a superior court would create <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties of the greatest magnitude and that endless litigation would result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that it would create a duplicated system involving enormous complexities and enormous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that if the jurisdiction is vested in the Superior Court the High Court will be relieved to a very great extent of the burden of jurisdiction which it has and it will be able to address itself to the more important aspects of jurisdiction- the cases which have a considerable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our relationship with the trade union movement is an open <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship and the decisions which are made by the Australian Labor Party, in association with the trade union movement, are publicly known arrangements made at conferences which are open to the Press and the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, and whereas our existing Australian flag and our national anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’ are perpetual reminders of these hard-won freedoms and of the wise British principle of the division of power, so well reflected in our own Australian Constitution with its careful separation of powers as between the Crown and Commonwealth Parliament, the Senate, the State parliaments, the Government-General and State Governors, and the independent courts of justice, and whereas all such rights, liberties, heritage, advancement and prosperity, etc., are of no avail if our armed forces are unprepared or incapable of repelling invasion of our shores or withstanding other military threats, so therefore must all these things be accorded the highest national concern and priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If what the honourable senator says is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position then I think that if anybody is going to sue  Senator Gair  for the 100 I am pretty sure from which corner it will come; it will come from the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The evidence put before the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs fortified me in the view that the grounds of divorce based on the principle of matrimonial fault should be removed and replaced by a single ground of divorce- breakdown of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clause in the previous Bill dealing with proceedings with respect to property- clause 57- has been split into two distinct sections, partly for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs will wish to examine this new Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated, I think, earlier that I hoped that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs would look at the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was also an important vehicle for the development of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law in this field and beyond it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The questions raised by  Mr Vincent  Gair’s letter to the  President  are questions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that where a Senator’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to sit in this chamber is conferred by the Constitution, the High Court is the appropriate body charged by the Constitution with the duties of interpretation, lt would be an unreal situation if this Parliament or any one House of the Parliament were to decide whether or not a senator had the qualifications to remain in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position has been put that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions under which this question has been put forward enable the chamber to refer this question to the Court of Disputed Returns, but that and the other provision made by the Act of Parliament in relation to questions respecting a vacancy have been viewed as exhausting the power which the Senate previously had to determine such questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Kerry O’Brien said that Professor Patrick Lane of Sydney University is an expert in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that where a senator’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to sit in this chamber is conferred by the Constitution, the High Court is the appropriate body charged by the Constitution with the duties of interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel, in view of the imminence of certain events, that it is appropriate that this Bill should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I should say this: It had been the intention of the previous Government that it should await the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs after its consideration of the terms of reference dealing with divorce, custody and family law before presenting any Bill relating to matrimonial causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is worth repeating the attitude of  Senator Greenwood,  as stated on 24 August 1971, when he was Attorney-General:  1 would have thought that where a Senator’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to sit in this chamber is conferred by the Constitution, the High Court is the appropriate body charged by the Constitution with the duties of interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The records show that he voted in 9 divisions, some of them very important divisions; that he spoke on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter; and that he voted in this chamber at approximately 10 p.m. on 2 April when you,  Mr President  were in the chair and were freely available to him should he have desired to convey to you a message of resignation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conclusively, by all the actions of  Senator Gair  he was a senator discharging and being permitted to discharge all his functions and, incidentally, taking part in divisions on 2 matters regarding <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the responsibility rested either with the senator who should have understood what were the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements or certainly with the  President  of this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> consequence is that if the seat were vacated before the election in Queensland there should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It believes that it can override all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedures and the Standing Orders of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal reason why the Government should not take out the House of Representatives at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The history of this matter then takes us to the rejection of the Bills- the clear, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and democratic rejection of that proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those 10 Bills were categorised it would be seen that three of them were electoral Bills, two were constitution alteration Bills- legislation which in any event should have awaited consideration by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention- and two were two health Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reality if one wants independence in these spheres, the judges are more protected by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions than is a Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We disregard the contention of some speakers on the Government side that there is some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reason, some traditional reason, why an Upper House should not vote against Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday, with full knowledge of what the decision meant, the Opposition Parties in this Senate rejected for the second time within 3 months the health Bills and thereby gave unchallengeable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds for the Government to seek its double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I feel supremely confident that as a result of this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> turmoil we will get a government which will have not only a majority in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate, we will also have a simplification and a cleansing of Australian politics by the disappearance of this Party which I believe has for so long been a blot on Australian politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the undoubted authority of  Senator Murphy,  who must be ranked as one of the great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers of our day and one of the most erudite gentlemen to act as Leader of the Government in this chamber; and in his opinion it is utterly right that an Opposition which has the numbers in this chamber to do so, should reject taxation measures or money Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the Honourable the  President  and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: That whereas our National Anthem, ‘God Save The Queen’, is a perpetual reminder of the Monarchy as a major feature of our <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> heritage; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second stage of the phasing out of cigarette and cigarette tobacco advertising on radio and television- newspapers not being within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> purview of the Australian Government- will begin on 1 September next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee referred to the enormous costs involved in High Court litigation arising from problems associated with sections of the Constitution which were considered appropriate in 1 90 1 but which are no longer appropriate in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are not able to adopt a flexible framework of government, if we are not able to approach <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues on the basis of assessing questions as matters of national importance and with mutual goodwill, then we will be in grave difficulty in preserving the parliamentary institutions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looked at the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee of 1959 and acted honestly I am certain that the results of referendums in Australia would be very much different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 24^ years that I have been in this place I have seen a fascinating course of development of <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some who would say that the course of action which the Senate took was against <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, the true <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> exponents recognise that this procedure is one whereby the Senate takes its risk to its members in the exercise of what it feels is a public duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not go on to refer to the subsequent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions which yet have to develop in a fascinating experience over, perhaps, the next days, weeks or months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that not pose a challenge to this Senate in accordance with its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers which we must keep in mind as the Government unfolds its program in the next week or two? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could find his name as a member of the committees that were considering <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reforms, the Standing Orders or any of the other more serious subjects that were debated in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet although he was a signatory to a lot of these decisions and conclusions including, notably, the recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee on electoral reform, when the Bill implementing the recommendation came before the House he repudiated his signature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might also remind honourable senators that a one-tenth variation from the quota was recommended by the Joint Committee of <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position with regard to the power vested in this Parliament to provide representation for the 2 Territories as proposed by this Bill is clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to term of office proposed by the Bill for Territory senators I would remind honourable senators that 16 years ago the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, upon which all parties were represented, recommended that there should be an election for half the senators every time there was a general election for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is presented for a third time to meet the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements for it to become law following the recent double dissolution of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators who wish to ask questions are precluded from the opportunity of doing so when they have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and democratic right to do just that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somebody mentioned <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So do not start talking to me about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy,  Senator Greenwood,  because quite seriously you are politically fraudulent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Getting back to what we were talking about before  Senator Greenwood  was foolish enough to talk about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet you have the temerity to stand up and talk about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means one thing and you, as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, a Q.C., who was previously the first law officer of this country, ought to understand what that means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has not been hesitant in his requests for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations nor in his instigation of costly and meaningless referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘the problem of preventing the Senate from inhibiting and frustrating government can be solved’ by 2 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes: ‘Fust, deprive the Senate of the power to reject Supply, for if it is to defeat a Government it should do so on a specific measure, not on general grounds of dislike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review also dealt with this question and made recommendations which were designed to alter the Constitution in order to overcome the type of attitude which is now prevalent in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party rejected the scheme because is was able to deny a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> majority in the South Australian House of Assembly at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made earlier by a senator to a report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which gave great attention to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review was formed on 24 May 1956 and was composed of some of the most distinguished members of both Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made an in-depth study of electoral and other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters affecting the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It continued:  and once the class of voters is chosen and their qualifications specified, we see no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way by which equality of voting may be evaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is not only a suggestion that has been advanced by the Australian Labor Party in government but also is the thinking, and the intelligent thinking, of the members who comprise the joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not just imaginative measures introduced by the Australian Labor Party; they are measures that have been advocated by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review and are supported by judicial opinion throughout other lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labour Party attempted in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill to mislead the people by suggesting that the referendum proposal to which it referred provided some ability for it to pass through the Parliament the type of legislation that we have in the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget also that when the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review delivered its report in 1959, irrespective of the 10 per cent variation recommendation which members of that Committee gave at that time, the advice of those disinterested distribution commissioners- those who had experience in recommending and drawing up boundaries and managing the electoral system- was that there should be a 20 per cent tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McAuliffe  in particular referred to the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review to incorporate into the Constitution a provision for electoral law with a limit of 10 per cent variation in the quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition, as I have said, is going to vote against it I think that the sooner we have a vote the sooner we can carry out the rest of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes to resolve this after our masters, the people, have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter to which I refer is whether this measure, if carried, will be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that the general purport of the Constitution is to confer upon the High Court of Australia the power to make decisions as to whether or not laws passed by this Parliament are or are not constitutionally valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second objective is to work for the restitution of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in Cyprus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is any doubt that Archbishop Makarios is still the constitutionally elected  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition oppose this legislation on other grounds besides those that I mentioned last night, they being mainly <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds concerning section 7 of the Constitution which states that the Senate shall be composed of senators for each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that Opposition senators have not learned any lessons from the last 2 Federal elections and have not listened to the advice of the very many voices that have been raised within their own Party and on the periphery of their Party about approaching important Government legislation and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters in a fashion different from that which was followed in the previous Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The learned <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities Quick and Garran made the point that section 128 does not have application to section 122. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It surely would be incumbent on any responsible government to seek the advice and the opinion of the Attorneys-General and the Solicitors-General of the States and to work out whether this Bill is acceptable constitutionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is valid to raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, within the last 12 months an important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter was raised there and perhaps Senate representation would assist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The criticism has been made that the Government is accelerating the development of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the size of the Territory,  Mr Calder  needs other assistance from what I might call mobile watchmen or senators, as they are called in strict <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terminology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave aside the question of whether the Representation Bill is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, as a poor lawyer, have the gravest doubts that it is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities,  Sir Robert  Garran and  Sir John  Quick, were saying: This was the intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who have looked at the debates of the convention in 1 897 and thereabouts and who have sought to find what was in the minds of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fathers have quite a clear view- we must have, from reading the debates of those years- that there was never any thought that there would be introduced into this chamber senators from the Territories who would have full voting rights and who would upset the formula of an equality of numbers from each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why the Government of the day, when seeking to alter the structure of the Commonwealth Parliament, did not take this issue as a major issue to the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of last year and say to the States and to representatives of the Territories: ‘Let us have a massive discussion on how in future the various areas which are not States at this moment shall grow and shall be represented in the Commonwealth Parliament’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party brought a host of trivia but nothing of fundamental importance to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the primary function of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention should be the initiation of a thorough discussion on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said is that I regret very much that the Commonwealth Government in bringing this measure to the Parliament has done nothing to bring to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention of the States and the Territories a debate upon the long range future of the 2 Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did so to show that it seemed to be assumed that there was no real doubt about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These choices are within its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak in this debate with no spirit of tendentiousness and certainly with no purpose other than to defend a cause of substantial import on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So with the Whitlam Labor Government having been defeated in the Senate election following the double dissolution, having gained 29 seats only out of 60, and with the people being entitled to expect the other 3 1 senators to defend the cause of senatorial <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> integrity, we are bound, when this Bill is presented to us after the dissolution, to give it the best of our consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The founding fathers ensured that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the States were maintained and protected by providing in the Constitution equality of representation of the original States on the basis that the colonies prior to Federation were equal constitutionally and politically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, concern was expressed at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> discussions that the provision did not preclude such representatives having the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giants in those <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> discussions such as Deakin, Brown, Barton and Braddon are recorded in convention debates which indicate that thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision also gives power to the Parliament to provide how the number of members shall be chosen from each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I say that for the Government now to seek to remove the nexus in the way in which the Representation Bill suggests is to act contrary to a fairly clearly expressed decision of the people, even though the nexus which is sought to be removed is not the total nexus which has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sanction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the way in which the Government has treated this Bill, the way it has treated the Senate and the way it proposes to treat the Senate in relation to this Bill, raises matters of the highest <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to put on record the views of the Opposition in regard to these matters of great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the circumstances set out in our amendment raised questions of the highest <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government still fails, or refuses for reasons best known to itself, to table this advice despite the fact that we are considering matters of grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance which are the subject of lively debate not only here but also in the community and in the Press and we have the prospect of a joint sitting taking place in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote a high <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority in relation to this matter with which I am sure the Government will not disagree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of when section 57 of the Constitution comes into operation, whether for a double dissolution or for a joint sitting, or for both, is of the highest <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is perfectly proper that we should express, in the form of a resolution of the Senate, a view which we hold because this matter is of such <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the interpretation of section 57, if that is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law of this nation, it is inimical to the role of the Senate as a house of review- indeed, to the role of the Senate in any way whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is accepted as the permissible interpretation of section 57, if it is accepted as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law of this country, the Senate can no longer effectively carry out its high responsibilities and duties in any shape or form, and certainly cannot act as a House reviewing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of very considerable importance, for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons that I have discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arguments regarding off-shore areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very doubtful on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds because of the time that failed to pass in the circumstances of this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, Senator Durack ‘s amendment raises the question whether it would be in accordance with proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice for the Senate to express its opinion to  His Excellency,  the Governor-General, as proposed in his amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an issue of fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plainly, it would not be constitutionally proper for the Senate to pursue the course of action proposed in the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> instrument issued for that purpose,  His Excellency  noted that the conditions upon which he was empowered by section 57 of the Constitution to dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously had been fulfilled in respect of six proposed laws, including the Bill for the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, those who are familiar with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and parliamentary procedure will perceive in the amendment moved by  Senator Durack  a resemblance to happenings in the Senate on at least three previous occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate sent an Address to the Governor-General requesting  His Excellency  to exercise his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to submit the proposed amendments of the Constitution to the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  we have here a concise and correct statement, by the GovernorGeneral of the day, of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle raised by the motion now before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Ronald  Ferguson again made the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position quite plain in the following passages:  1 am advised further that to accede to the request contained in your Address would imply a recognition of a right in the Senate to make the Ministers of State for the Commonwealth directly responsible to that Chamber for advice tendered to the Governor-General in relation to the exercise of an Executive power vested in him by the terms of the Constitution, and that such a recognition would not be in accordance with the accepted principles of responsible government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without, however, conceding the existence of any <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> obligation to reply to the request contained in your Address, 1 desire to add for your information, and with the concurrence of my Ministers, that the grounds on which I decided to dissolve both Houses of Parliament simultaneously appear from the communication already made by the Prime Minister, with my permission and by my authority, to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am indebted to the authors of the work ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Law’,  Mr J.  I. Fajgenbaum and  Mr Peter  Hanks of Monash University, for the description of the incident that I now mention to honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a most eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety of my approval to such a regulation as is postulated by the address, it cannot be doubted that normally by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, confirmed and perhaps strengthened, by the pronouncement of the Imperial Conference of 1926. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My plain duty in such circumstances, as it appears to me, acting, not as the representative of  His  Majesty the King as a constituent part of the Commonwealth Parliament, but as the designated executant of a statutory power created and conferred by the whole Parliament, is simply to adhere to the normal principles of responsible government by following the advice of the Ministers who are constitutionally assigned to me for the time being as my advisers, and who must take the responsibility of that advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as you request me to do, I should reject their advice, supported as it is by the considered opinion of the House of Representatives, and should act upon the equally considered contrary opinion of the Senate, my conduct would, 1 fear, even on ordinary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds, amount to an open personal preference of one House against the other- in other words, an act of partisanship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is another reason- and that is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes of section 57 of the Constitution have not yet run their course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Government’s view, it would not be constitutionally proper to table the legal opinions before the joint sitting is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of what might be the option in this chamber, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions will enable the weight of numbers of the House of Representatives to ensure that that Bill becomes law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of this Bill, surely it is important for us to know and to be satisfied that the situation of deadlock- the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions of deadlock- have been reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we in this chamber have introduced an amendment which sets out the chronology, which sets out the events and which demonstrates that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions have not been satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest that when these facts are set out there is one interpretation which stands out, and that is the prima facie interpretation that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions have not been satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government ought to recognise that the rights which the Constitution confers are rights which all parties, whether they are in government or in opposition, ought to protect because they are in due course the only protections in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy which we can rely upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggests that what the Senate is doing is not constitutionally proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggests that it is constitutionally inappropriate for the Senate to concern itself with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggests that it is constitutionally futile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation, as the Governor-General indicated, represented the proprieties of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government- the proprieties of responsible government- and one does not doubt that in a unitary system that is the situation which ought to prevail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is open to the Governor-General to obtain advice on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question from other quarters- perhaps from the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General or eminent counseland then a solemn responsibility rests on him to make a judgment on whether a dissolution is needed to serve the purposes of good Government by giving to the electorate the duty of resolving a situation which Parliament cannot resolve for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts relate a story which I think quite clearly indicates that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements have not been complied with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to the amendment, the AttorneyGeneral,  Senator Murphy,  made a speech to the Senate during the course of which he raised matters of principle which go far beyond the importance or the significance of this Bill and which go right to the heart of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy, the concept of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State and therefore to the democratic institution in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters should be examined as such because, if  Senator Murphy’s  statement tonight is to prevail, the concept of the GovernorGeneral as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State will become a much narrower and much more delimited function and a function which, without any offence, would be that of a puppet response to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was very careful never to say that it was constitutionally illegal for the Senate to proceed in terms of the amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that it would be constitutionally improper and constitutionally futile to take such action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that quite clearly the Attorney-General tonight by his silence on the question of constitutionality made it clear that  Senator Durack  ‘s amendment is entirely <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is saying that it has a duty, a responsibility and a clear right to make known to every person in this country- to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, to the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and his Cabinet, to the Government and to the people of Australiawhat the Opposition regards as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To conceive the idea that a Governor-General should be so isolated from the community that he should not be able to respond to events in the community and that he should not be capable of perusing and being influenced by the debates in this or any other chamber is to deny the fundamental duty of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State over the centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the primary duty of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State, whether monarch or Governor-General, to brief himself or herself fully on the happenings of the day and the happenings in the life and public affairs of the community, so that when a decision is to be taken the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head is fully aware of the events and can bring down an independent judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I felt that  Senator Murphy’s  speech tonight was the socialist Left view of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head who must, under a socialist view, simply be there in a puppet fashion to do the will of the Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly, no one denies the competence of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head to seek that advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchs of England over the centuries regarded this duty as their primary duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight the Attorney-General said, in effect, that there is no individual discretion in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be wrong and it would be grave, because within the powers of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State the discretions are vital and important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Senate has not been asked by the Attorney-General to put aside the amendment because it is unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was interesting tonight that there was no opinion, hastily secured, from the Solicitor-General or from the AttorneyGeneral’s Department- no legal opinion about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the Opposition to move this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that has been said is that it is constitutionally improper and constitutionally futile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was contemplated that the Parliament would meet in mid-February of this year, but the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  decided that he would seek a formal opening of the Parliament by  Her  Majesty the Queen, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Head of State, and in order to do so it was necessary to prorogue the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is some dissension as to whether the Bill is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, I hope that the High Court will fix up that dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No further progress can be made in this matter until this very difficult legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question is resolved by the High Court of Australiathe question which we facilitated, by vote in the Senate last year, being put to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that although it is appropriate for the question of the Commonwealth’s sovereignty over the off-shore areas to be resolved, although we support the claim to sovereignty and although we support in principle the idea that the Commonwealth Government should have a broad legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sovereignty over these areas, when all is said and done we are even at the present time engaged in an international conference at which we are asserting very broad claims over the continental shelf extending seawards 200 miles or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in the light of that report and the facts relating to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right of either the States or the Commonwealth to have control over the off-shore submerged lands around this great continent that the original Bill- the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill- was given first and second readings by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of whether the Commonwealth or the States has the responsibility within the Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework for the exercise of rights arising or the performance of obligations accepted under the International Convention on the Continental Shelf and under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone is undecided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to what Justices of the High Court have saidand all witnesses who gave evidence on this aspect generally concurred- it would appear that the Commonwealth has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate under its external affairs power to give effect to international obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do so, it would mean that in significant and, possibly, expanding areas the Commonwealth heads of power would become more extensive than the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions expressly contemplate- and, consequentially, reduce the exclusive area of State authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the invitation of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Greenwood),  I do not want to get into any of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> niceties or difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are the superior wage-fixing tribunal in this country, and within the ambit of your jurisdiction you are not limited, as the Arbitration Commission is limited, by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations and definitions of disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is because of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position with the State and Federal set-up, as well as the specialist agencies that have been established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably Opposition senators refused to debate that Bill and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> considerations relating to double dissolutions of Parliament then led to a similar Bill being introduced in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Parliament to enact legislation such as that contained in the Bill was clarified by the very important decision of the High Court in what is known as the Concrete Pipes Case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for State courts and cannot, under the Constitution, intervene in the organisation of these courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no tradition, as has been suggested, that the Senate will not use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, whenever it considers it necessary or desirable to do so, in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have been reminded, he was not deterred then by any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> inhibitions on the activities of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was some argument in earlier days in which I was involved that something might be done by way of amendment to the Banking Act, but that came under the same <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, handicapped as it is by lack of adequate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to combat inflation, is nevertheless determined to continue the fight with all vigour, with the aid of the instruments at its disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That an organisation within or under an authority of the Interstate Commission is the appropriate body with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power ( binding both State and Federal authorities) to administer all Federal laws affecting Tasmania’s interstate and foreign shipping, with power to fix freights, wages, hours, schedules, port dues, and recommend financial assistance for ship construction and operation to ensure reliable and efficient shipping services; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They should be discussed after the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedures that the Government is using in order to get around the frustration caused by the Senate have been exhausted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is not a dry <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, legalistic approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ought to know sufficient of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> immunity to know that we are not liable for rates or State taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am addressing myself to an important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It behoves the whole Senate to insist that moneys that we collect from our people are appropriated only to Federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> purposes, and this is not one of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion I assert that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law coincides with commonsense to require that this project should be considered as beyond our powers and, on the evidence submitted to us, not justified from either the point of view of economics or social improvement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are now proposing- this reduction in the permissible variation between electorateswas first proposed 15 years ago by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review established by  Sir Robert  Menzies in 1 956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee- that all party Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Reviewunanimously recommended exactly the measure that we are now putting forward, briefly at the end of 1958, and with full reasons at the end of 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the objective of the legislation now before this Parliament- to implement by law a proposal endorsed by the distinguished Committee of both Houses and all parties as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment 15 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are resolved not to let legislation go through the House of Representatives and the Senate which we believe is bad in principle and which would detract from the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles of parliamentary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party put forward a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal which would have torpedoed any consideration of the principle of one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee has been referred to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee ignored all professional advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  lays great emphasis on the recommendations of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not to do so would be to deny <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> representative government in Australia and to set up a dictatorship in a House which is not based on that form of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review has described as a gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, the Supreme Court of the United States and the Federal Council of the Liberal Party of Australia, though that is not exactly a good recommendation, support equality of representation as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister quoted a section from the 1959 report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review but I believe that it needs to be said again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was assumed that, consistent with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement, there would be equality of value of votes cast in elections for this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professional advice to the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review was that we need 20 per cent variation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would wish to be able to denigrate the Senate in carrying out its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> function which has just been reinforced by the people of Australia in a fully democratic vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review he is reported in this way: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measure which was debated earlier today by this Joint Sitting began in the minds of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, which was established by Prime Minister Menzies as long ago as 1958. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is now turning to a device which will increase the number of honourable senators so that he will not have to rely on the normal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process which has been with us since 1901, and although the number of honourable senators has been increased relying on section 7 of the Constitution and on the concept of the Senate as a States House, the Government has seen fit to enlarge the Senate not for the purpose of giving greater voice to the Territories of the Commonwealth but rather to give itself perpetual control of that place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, in 1957 the Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Reform appointed by the Northern Territory Legislative Council included in its report a recommendation for Senate representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that when the Senate debated this matter our Party in that place moved an amendment to have it referred to a committee for examination, particularly as to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> standing and legality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either Government supporters are interested in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> standing of their Government’s legislation or they are interested only in their own rhetoric. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills therefore not only are called into question on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds but also are substantially against the will of the people as expressed at 2 referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds the Senate was created on the basis of equality, originally with 6 senators for each of the States and then the number was lifted to ten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since when has a mere Act of this Parliament sought to put asunder and to disturb the entire <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the law of this country is to deteriorate into such a state that the entire <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure can be broken down- chiselled here, modified here- by a mere wilful Act of Parliament, then the people of Australia will find themselves in a very sorry, desperate state of affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way do I under-estimate the needs of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advancement in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fully aware of the efforts that my friend and colleague, the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  has made to achieve <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advancement for the Northern Territory and Senate representation for that Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was largely due to the pressures applied by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the elected members of the Northern Territory Legislative Council that the former Liberal Party-Country Party Government made a firm offer to the Northern Territory towards <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advancement and executive power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it washed its hands of those proposals and has given that Joint Committee a charter to investigate a form of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advancement for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has pre-empted the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review which is currently going on and in which both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is purely a political stunt that could well slow down the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advancement of both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have pointed out that it makes a complete mockery of the Senate as a States House and there are all sorts of doubts as to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  said it shatters the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some are: The Bill is not <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>; it is doubtful whether the founding fathers intended that the people of the Territories should have representation; and the Territories are already over-represented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There, in plain language, is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legitimacy for this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should seek to erect a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> edifice which shall be a guarantee of liberty and union for all time to come to the whole people of this continent and the adjacent islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is for us, as members of Parliament, to remind ourselves that we are passing a day or two in resolving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conflicts while outside in the nation those who are working are doing so under great tribulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Senate has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority and I have power to persuade in the country, I wil use my vote in the Senate to establish the right of the people who voted for me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so far from contenting himself with a basis upon which to hold by-elections, which is the appropriate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision for the Senate, he provides also that every time the resignation of a Territorial senator is procured a by-election shall be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of arguments have we heard today from some of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sages from the other side of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought the Government went to the people to seek a mandate for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform at the last election to bring the House of Representatives and Senate elections always together compulsorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must know that there are grave doubts as to the constitutionality of these Territorial representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary I believe that the right course for this Government and this Parliament to follow is to take this matter to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions between the Commonwealth, the States and local government, to invite Territorial representatives to those conventions, and to have protracted discussion on the future nature and structure of the Territories, their movement into full statehood and their representation in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate itself is performing its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge that these measures be put aside, that they be taken to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, that second thoughts be given to them so that we can move these Territories into full Statehood and real and proper recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could be marginally out in these figures, but I believe that at the 2 <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions the Labor movement had one representative out of 135. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That government introduced the Bill before it found out whether it was constitutionally possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the charade of having to have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment after we had actually enacted the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1 947 we had a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was one of the few <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments carried by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was carried because it was put by both sides of the Australian Parliament to the people, as has any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment which has been successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation in relation to the States onshore minerals stands on the basic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Australian Parliament to regulate overseas trade and interstate trade, and also, at appropriate times, the general powers for the defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  promised several weeks ago to table the advice that he and his Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  gave to the Governor-General that this Bill had failed to pass the Senate or had been rejected by it within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said in this Parliament and will keep repeating for as long as that assertion about the Government having a mandate to do certain things is made: There is not one <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to which the Government can point- the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is a Queen’s Counsel- who will maintain the mandate doctrine in our system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe analysis shows, even if it should be that this Bill proves to be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>- that is a matter for the courts to decide, not for anyone to say what he thinks will happen- that it gives practically uncontrolled power to the proposed Authority and to the Minister and the Government and provides for practically no parliamentary oversight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is admitted by you all through another body engaged in this exercise that there is some doubt about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legal advice indicates that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority exists to support Australian Government construction of many, if not most, of the roads to be included in this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, I was concerned that the claim that the 2 Bills were joined together on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis was not satisfactorily proven to me; nor, I think, to anybody else at the time the work ceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also an important vehicle for the development of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law in this field and beyond it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time the year opened on I July 1973 the current legislator* had secured obvious and broad <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it had taken some 3 or 4 years to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which had inhibited the introduction of this legislation until the early 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He states that from the position of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> strength which the legislation obtained it was possible to take quicker and firmer action against price agreements and continue actions against retail price maintenance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that the debate on this Bill will be a classic illustration of the conclusion which the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee reached in 1959 with regard to the role of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least until the Committee stage 1 have time to deal only with one of them, that is, the suggestion which was made in another place that the Bill will lead to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal wrangles on a large scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this measure has been carefully framed to ensure that it falls within the limits of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But 1 want to emphasise that there is no reason whatsoever, if the State governments are sincere in their professed desire to protect consumers, why there should not be a referral of power so that firms and individuals can be embraced within that part of the legislation and also to set at rest any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubts there may be in respect of its validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they did so they would at least be seen to be sincere and it would be apparent that there were at least some areas in which they were prepared to take a national approach and the criticism based on any alleged <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> invalidity would completely disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the consumer sues under State law the trader will have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> defence- the very defence about which I am talking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, if it is enacted, will deprive the consumers of that opportunity to have claims referred, because under section 109, the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> position is such that this would no longer be possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also an important vehicle for the development of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law in this field and beyond it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate affirms the decision taken by resolution of the Senate on 31 May 1973 that the Australian Parliament join with the Parliaments of the States in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention to be convened to review the Australian Constitution in September of that year, and at such subsequent times as the Convention from time to time determined, and agrees: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to detail the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties and the absence in the Bill of a provision for the establishment of consumer claim tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will also be doubt as to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been an endeavour, certainly in clause 75 of the Bill, to overcome the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulty that may arise whereby all the effectiveness of the State laws may be wiped out by the overriding effect of the Commonwealth provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A brewery within the confines of Tasmania was alleged to be monopolising trade against Carlton and United Breweries Ltd. Of course, due to the comparative lack of purposeful matters to be considered, that was a test case in order to have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions determined in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to go into that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> argument, except to say that it is not appreciated by many people outside this chamber that in fact that may well be the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the view we have expressed is correct and constitutionally the State legislation in respect of these tribunals will be wiped out as far as an individual dealing with a corporation is concerned, there will be a great loss to the consumers and to consumer organisations; they will be unable to deal in that area in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position therefore is that, as has been said time and again, the inclusion of this Part in the legislation at the moment will lead to confusion, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt and probably a denial of some rights which consumers have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave that question as to which law operates somewhat open because I think that there are some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which one day a company which is challenged will take to the court and the court will have make its decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was clearly developed as a Federation to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement and the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to clause 55 which applies, because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Parliament, to persons as well as to corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the advantage of a reference of powers would be to obviate any legal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties which, as has been indicated, may arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the Constitution which says that and nothing in an Act of Parliament which enacts an inconsistent law can continue the life of State law against that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> invalidity provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately this comes up against a Sale of Goods Act a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question arises and for as long as the long pocket of Coles will last in the taking of appeals to the High Court it will be able to litigate such a fellow out of any access to justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, this legislation is a blatant attempt to ignore the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of the different governments, be they State or local government authorities, and to place even minor administrative decisions on all road matters in the hands of Canberra politicians and the Canberra public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the past the Turkish minority on the island has been denied its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights in many respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the TurkishCypriot minority is entitled, as indeed is the Greek-Cypriot majority, to guarantees of security, safety and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Turkish Foreign Minister to issue an ultimatum that such a complex and far-reaching matter as the future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements for Cyprus should in effect be determined without appropriate consideration by the Greek or Cyprus governments is quite unreasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition members of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs have informed me that it is a sensible proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to speak briefly on this motion and to make a suggestion which probably would have to be considered by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, of which I am a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my capacity as  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, I immediately set in train the preparation of an interim report from the Committee on what has happened in respect of the general reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to put before the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs some clauses which would achieve that objective so that it may also advise the Senate on that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs be empowered up till the time of presenting its final report to table all of the evidence or documents presented to any of the Standing Committees on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to inform the Senate that on 22 August I received letters from the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  nominating the following senators for membership on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs:  Senator Button, Senator Chaney, Senator Durack, Senator Everett, Senator James  McClelland and  Senator Missen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a clear intimidatory threat to the Senate in an endeavour to prevent us from exercising our proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility and our duty to scrutinise legislation with a view to moving proper amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we have seen the 2 Houses of Parliament acting in accordance with their proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this has been a good example of the way our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bicameral system works, and that it has been a good example of the proper and important role of the Senate under our Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the High Court will presumably keep the Minister in line if he transgresses the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees appointed last Session (other than the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which was re-appointed on 16 August 1974) be re-appointed and be known, unless otherwise ordered, as the Standing Committees on- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One committee, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, is chaired by  Senator James  McClelland and is examining divorce law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate was created to have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions that it was given was the capacity to review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I beseech honourable senators, irrespective of Party, who have any belief in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprieties, to carry the amendment and let the Senate get on with its job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that Pensioners transport be made free within the Federation where the Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing which was so important so far as fixing up inflation was concerned was the appointment of some senators to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present an interim report and transcript of evidence from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on its inquiry into the law and administration of divorce and related matters and the Family Law Bill 1974.I move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is well aware that some 2 years ago as a result of certain discussions between the then Commonwealth Government and the various States a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention was called into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those senators and members were duly appointed from both Houses and the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention met last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet when we come to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention the principle of equality is not carried through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a distressing fact of political life, as revealed by the contribution we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers),  that the Opposition appears to be so bankrupt of any constructive contribution to the government of this country that all it can debate on a motion relating to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is the question of representation inter partes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the second session of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, set down for the first week in November, will be a landmark for the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the past 12 months scores of persons throughout Australia, including members of Parliament of all political persuasions, have been engaged on the task of endeavouring to get before that second session of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention proper proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would deny  Senator Hall,  who represents a party which has representation not only in this chamber but also in another chamber, representation at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention; yet on the other hand it would, with complete inconsistency, harbour within its own ranks a person whom I have no hesitation in describing tonight as a complete imposter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I link this matter with that which is being debated by the Senate on the basis that the Opposition, whilst maintaining an attitude of hostility towards  Senator Hall,  reflected in its opposition to his being a representative of this chamber at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, nevertheless seeks to embrace within its own ranks a person who has masqueraded for far too long as an Independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask you,  Mr Acting Deputy  President: What relevance has  Senator Townley  ‘s conduct in 1970, before a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention was ever thought of, to the motions which are before the chamber at the present time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject matter of the question under discussion is the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, who shall attend it, what may be done at it and what are its purposes, hopes and aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject matter is tremendously wide, but I say that  Senator Townley  ‘s history is not part of the subject matter comprehended by the expression  <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention ‘ or the matters raised in the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what the Opposition said, it was obviously endeavouring to exclude  Senator Hall  as a representative of this Senate at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has presented the same formula for the appointment of Senate representation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention as it presented earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gair  of the Democratic Labor Party was a delegate to the last <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention that was held in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take issue with  Senator Withers  about the emphasis that he placed on the question of numbers at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that he wants to transform the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention into another senatorial chamber, because no votes are taken at the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the way in which the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks areas in which the States and the Commonwealth agree on the presentation of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect whom one represents in this place or the House of Representatives is quite irrelevant at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no reason for the matter to be determined on that basis because the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention seeks to find things upon which we can agree, not the things upon which we disagree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that  Senator Withers  has not had experience on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On many occasions during the last <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention meetings agreement was reached with all the States, with the exception of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has regard to the position in the Senate and to the fact that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention argument will take place about the philosophies of the relationships between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention does not endeavour to determine these matters on the basis of who one is or whom one represents or on the numerical strength of the political persuasions of the delegates to the Constitutinal Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review elected democratically by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights, but is the States’ House by which all Australians in their own sovereign states formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources of their mutual benefit and advancement, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obstruction to abandoning the Panel at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator JAMES McCLELLANDHonourable senators will recall that yesterday in my capacity as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs I tabled an interim report on the law and administration of divorce and related matters and the Family Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You cannot say that seriously of the Vernon report or the report on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review, which were pigeonholed in your term of office and on which dust was allowed to settle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all honourable senators reject non <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> solutions to our problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least they are prepared publicly to state their commitment to the destruction of the economy on the one hand and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government on the other hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for five separate Acts arises from a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that laws imposing taxes should deal with one subject of taxation only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-54-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various areas of investigation have been set up for standing committees, select committees and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> committees in which we take part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives has chosen not to fulfil the function to which it has a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility, in the interests of the Australian taxpayer and of all members of Parliament, I think the pursuit of the compilation of the Estimates has to be maintained by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the reason is legitimate and the purpose sound and in accordance with proper parliamentary usage we are all the better informed, but if something is being attempted which lacks statutory approval or is contrary to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprieties, likewise we are better informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it solely a mimic, a reproduction, of the House of Representatives or is it intended to be under the Constitution and by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice a different House? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is setting up the Australian Housing Corporation, a new body to start all those housing functions that the Australian Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I present the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the law and administration of divorce and related matters and the Family Law BUI 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, or you,  Mr President,  if it is a matter for the Department of the Senate, or the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McLelland)  in his capacity as Minister in charge of the Australian Government Publishing Service, will ensure that an appropriate number of copies of this report is made available for the interested public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Orders, the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs be empowered on its reappointment to consider the clauses of the Family Law Bill 1 974 during its consideration of the matter previously referred to it, namely the Law and Administration of Divorce, Custody and Family Matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obstacle to the Tribunal having power to determine salaries for these people but it is desirable for the sake of consistency that they should be considered by the Tribunal in conjunction with judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this matter because it involves a question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> priority involved in this situation is that the Constitution of Australia states that the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is involved is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proprieties of the Senate versus the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to know by what right a Vice-Regal notice can be sent to the newspapers of Australia putting below the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives the  President  of the the Senate, who traditionally for 70 years has been acknowledged constitutionally and without qualification as being senior to the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives on these ceremonial occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter is involved in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the propriety of subverting the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system of administrative processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was raised this morning when the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs was put down in the Senate and when a motion was moved that the Senate take note of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen spoke on the subject of the presentation of the report by my colleague,  Senator James  McClelland, from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs relating to its consideration and its recommendations after its deliberations on the Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>full and proper consideration can be given by senators and all other interested persons to the Report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, tabled in the Senate on 1 S October; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to  Senator James  McClelland as  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and it relates to a report of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Webster, that the Bill which we are now considering and which was considered by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is identical in the matters to which exception is taken to a Bill which was introduced in this Senate on 13 December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will recall that it was in 1971, I think, that I moved for the reference of this whole question to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention one of the broad propositions put forward by the Australian Government was that the Constitution should be altered so that the Federal Parliament would be able to arm the Government with the broad powers of economic management which are held by governments of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite absurd that the Government does not have clear powers to manage the economy and that honourable senators opposite should take up their present stand when they will recall that they bitterly opposed the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum to enable this Parliament to have powers over incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is basic to the management of the economy, yet they took the stand that not even the Federal Parliament was to be entrusted with those <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has nothing to congratulate itself on in its repeated obstruction of the Government’s endeavours, even with its limited <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, to act on behalf of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741022_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It then came to the Senate where it was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs- of which I must confess I was a member at that time- and it was still before that Committee when the Parliament was prorogued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Attorney-General had an opportunity to study the amendments to the Family Law Bill proposed by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and, in particular, the amendments which would defer the right to commence proceedings for dissolution of marriage until after a period of 12 months separation has actually occurred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have to be questioned whether some of the matters referred to in the Tariff Board report could be undertaken by the Australian Government for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Greenwood’s ability to put a very large spoke in the wheel of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention because of the views he holds for political reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741023_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present the transcript of the in camera evidence from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on its inquiry into the law and administration of divorce and matters related to the Family Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that in 2 years’ time  Senator Greenwood  can come back to this chamber and say: ‘Look, that legislation has now been to the High Court and the doubt which I expressed in the debate on the legislation as to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity has now been resolved against the position adopted by the Labor Party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he will do this if he is really concerned about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe- and maybe I am pessimistic in my approach- that there will be co-operation between the various groupings to resolve the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which the Moore v. Doyle case has thrown up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the ultimate solution must be an amendment of the Constitution, and I hope that the parties involved could use the difficulties found in the Moore v. Doyle case to reach the stage where a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, couched not in extravagant terms but in language which has the ability to command support from both wings of the political movements in Australia, and from employer organisations and unions, might be devised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an interesting sidelight possibly on the attitudes which parties take that the desire to use the processes of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention for the promotion of a further referendum on this subject of widening the industrial power of the Commonwealth was expressed as part of the Opposition Parties’ platform at the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is currently constituted and is about to come into its second session, with or without Commonwealth representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I emphasise is that if this legislation is rejected and delayed, as  Senator Greenwood  would like, the trade unions which expected <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes via the national Parliament will find that the unions will have to slug it out, as it were, in a campaign to get members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us talk to the employers, the unions and the States and let us see whether we can get a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, he goes on to express what in the light of recent history we can only regard as the most purblind optimism when he suggests that we can have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Button  points out, this is not something about which we can twiddle our thumbs while we wait for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment and say that it is only of interest to the lawyers and does not really matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we can afford the luxury of waiting for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, which is  Senator Greenwood  ‘s solution to this tangled problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact I received a little gentle mauling myself for expressing opinions based on misinformation, I must confess, at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention held in Sydney in September last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found myself in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> gathering with the Attorneys-General and the Ministers for Labour and Industry of the various States present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that, rather than wait for that or for some mythical consensus between the major parties which will promote the possibility of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform going through, it is about time we did something about the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is a genuine doubt as to whether a Commonwealth legislative enactment is the most efficacious way of proceeding and whether accession to the Convention and the provision of the abilities which this Convention grants will be provided on a sure <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be interested to know the way in which the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  views the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base upon which the legislation is framed, because it does appear that the opportunity to enforce arbitration agreements or to rely upon awards made in foreign arbitrations is a right which citizens have in the conduct of their litigation within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sense there is a domestic matter which may have application so as to raise the question whether or not there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base for the Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside some of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions which may arise with regard to that, it obviously is a facility which is of great advantage if that award can readily be produced in the courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal question he raised is one of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> bases of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to assume from this arrangement that  Senator Greenwood  was prepared to accept a representative of the DLP as being entitled to be in attendance at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention but is not prepared to give like representation to  Senator Hall,  who is a selfprofessed Liberal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But regardless of the petty attitude of the Opposition in this chamber, which is prepared to wreck the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention rather than have  Senator Hall  attend in the place of the former Australian Democratic Labor Party representatives who mercifully are no longer represented here, it appears that the Convention could not be held in any event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it appears that between them the Liberal and Country Parties have succeeded in wrecking the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this Bill, and particularly in the amendments which the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs proposes, there are suggestions that the Commonwealth should go further in exercising its powers over marriage, divorce and matrimonial affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr W. W. Hartin, the  Deputy  Director of the Cairnmillar Institute of Melbourne, made a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on this question of blame, guilt and fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the work of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which has presented 2 reports to the Senate on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others have suggested, as indeed a couple of the members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has suggested, that 12 months is too short and that we should opt for 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-There are some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill which we are considering will have offered to it a number of amendments which are contained in the large report from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am grateful to  Senator Missen  and to  Senator James  McClelland for the way in which they have explained the views of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the purposes of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one of the paragraphs of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs it was suggested that there could be another ground for dissolution, and that is the ground of intolerable conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I deal with some matters of detail I wish to place on record 2 facts; firstly that I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which examined the detailed provisions of this Bill and, secondly, that over a long period I practised professionally in this jurisdiction in the State of Tasmania both at supreme court and lower court levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that out of its consideration of the effect of this legislation will ultimately come, together with some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments- if they are possible- the ideal measure which  Senator Baume  has in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like previous speakers, have had the privilege of serving on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which examined a great deal of material on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are basically the reasons which have led me, both as a legal practitioner and as a member of the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, to reject entirely the present fault grounds for dissolution of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to just 4 matters which have been dealt with in great detail by my colleagues on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish that all honourable senators had had the opportunity to hear the views of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and particularly the evidence of Judge Burnett of the South Australian Family Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 9 1 of the Bill provides for the establishment of a Family Law Advisory Committee in respect of which a new draft section has been suggested in the report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for having done in a very short time a terrific amount of work on this highly important legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very pleased to hear the comments of  Senator Laucke  when he paid tribute to the members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that is not to be wondered at because members of the legal profession comprised the majority of the membership of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points which were made in the 2 reports of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- the interim report and latterly the substantial report- representing the judgment of the Committee on the Bill, have been of tremendous guidance to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-When the debate was interrupted this evening I had gone so far as to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for the very valuable work which that Committee carried out in analysing submissions, approaching 120 in number, which were made to it and which enabled it to produce for the benefit of the Senate, firstly, an interim report and, subsequently, a substantive report based upon the Committee’s analysis and judgment of those submissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the variations are prompted by the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which was presented this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that it would be better if the period were 2 years, and I find that that extra period was suggested in the minority report that accompanied the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review elected democratically by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights, but is the States ‘ House by which all Australians in their own sovereign States formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources for their mutual benefit and advancement, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the AttorneyGeneral seen a report in today’s ‘Australian’ accusing the Senate Opposition of causing ‘a childish impasse’ over the Australian Parliament’s delegation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention by its insistence that  Senator Steele  Hall should be excluded from that delegation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall that during the referenda associated with the 18 May election Opposition senators campaigned against the referenda on the basis that the proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes should be considered by the sessions of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which have now been abandoned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister have any views on the desirability of continuing the Convention and the likelihood of its producing any solutions to Australia’s present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties in these circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall the statements of Opposition senators in the pre-election campaign that various referenda ought not to be carried because matters ought to be considered at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the course of the debate the legislation was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for examination and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to which the Bill was referred although, as it happened, the time of the Parliament ran out before that Committee had completed its inquiries into the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reasonable to point out that even at this time there are many amendments which have been proposed by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which had this Bill referred to it for consideration and which did such an excellent job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the many recommendations which have come forward as a result of the excellent work done by those associated with the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs suggest that a great deal of variation is required to the Family Law Bill which is before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the definition of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs should be noted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But broadly, having been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for many months, indeed years, I will be supporting the recommended amendments of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders, the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs be empowered to consider the clauses of the National Compensation Bill 1974; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak to the motion for referral of the National Compensation Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for examination and then the Senate debated the matter further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has referred this legislation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, it was a proposal from the Government- an honourable senator on the Government side- which we agreed to quite some time ago before the debate took place in the other place, that this National Compensation Bill should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for further investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Credit should be given to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which worked so hard and helped all of us so much to understand and to improve the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other provisions in the Bill that I find completely unacceptable and these urgently need further examination, examination beyond the limited examination that was made of them by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would support strongly suggestion to defer consideration of Family Law Bill for 6 months to enable interested people to examine report of Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs presented 2 weeks ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>full and proper consideration can be given by senators and all other interested persons to the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, tabled in the Senate on15 October; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However we must, in good conscience, speak out against the radical changes proposed in the new Family Law Bill 1974, and ask for six months’ delay in any further debate on it, so that the clauses of the Bill and the extensive amendments proposed by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, can be properly and responsibly assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter goes on: the Interim Report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs appears to give a false impression of the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the short time that we have had to deal with this Bill and look at the report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, there are people who are saying: ‘Please defer it; let us take a little bit more time ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which considered the Bill, I think it is fair to say to the Senate that when I started my consideration of the Bill I had deep misgivings about what the Bill might achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, on the evidence which was before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, it can be insofar as dissolution of marriage is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addressing myself to the second reading debate on this Bill, I express my gratitude to all senators, in particular those members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs who have given searching and deliberate consideration to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not on this ground support a hasty move on the Bill but I think the report we have received from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is excellent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate to say that it is a matter for regret that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention scheduled to be held in Adelaide next week has been postponed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The postponement need not have happened, but the fact that it has happened dashes the hopes of those who saw in this Convention a real hope for an impetus to desirable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention had not taken place because of the action of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The editorial in this morning’s ‘Australian’ newspaper likewise sought to place the entire blame for the fact that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention was not being held upon the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point which is made in the editorial and which has been made on other occasions is that last year’s representation at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention included the Demoratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point which was made in the editorial in this morning’s Press to which I have referred was the credibility of the Opposition’s commitment to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform which must, it said, be seriously questioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its policy documents have emphasised the reliance it places upon the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention as the forum in which a consensus can be developed from which <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes can be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters of record and they are matters which indicate the Opposition’s commitment to the purposes of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that it has right from the outset agreed with the Opposition parties that it would participate in the Convention, the Government has shown by its conduct that it regards the Convention as a less than satisfactory medium for securing support for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since this Government came into power we have had 6 referenda, not one of which has been carried and not one of which was submitted to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention beforehand in an effort to obtain support from the representatives of the States as a means of achieving that sort of consensus which experience ought to have demonstrated was necessary for the carrying of referenda in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One further proposal was suggested by the Government at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate rejected it because it had not the support of the States and because it seemed proper that the matter ought to go back to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention from which it had originally emanated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This failure to support the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention as a forum where the referendum proposals could have been considered does suggest that the Government did not see any value in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention as a place where support might be obtained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government appears to have regarded the defeat of the referenda as matters of pride and in petulance it has decided not to proceed further with the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a meeting of the Executive Committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which was held in Melbourne in June of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention there was every opportunity for the proposition which prevailed in regard to all the other State delegations to prevail in the case of the Commonwealth delegation, that is, that there was a representation from each House of the Parliament and that there was equality of representation between the parties represented in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian Parliament has given to his Liberal Movement a representative at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that for reasons best known to  Mr Whitlam  he decided that the Commonwealth should retire from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention with what grace it was able to muster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was reading from a prepared statement and obviously was under some Party discipline to explain to the Senate why he had led the fight to wreck the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I have regarded him as a fairly authoritarian person, I really did not realise he harboured the dictatorial attitude that he revealed tonight, in his statement that he believed that the Liberal Movement could be represented on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention only if his Party said so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it should not have a seat as part of the Senate at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention because  Senator Greenwood  has not said so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as he ended, any regard that I had for his position evaporated as he attributed to the Government less than noble sentiments and said that it had set out to wreck the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention by including me as one of the delegates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What proof has the noble lawyer to substantiate the charge he has made that the Government has deliberately wrecked the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator has attacked the Press for interpreting his obstruction to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator said that only his Party should say, by agreement with others, who can be a member of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this great democrat who bemoans the failure of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention because his view as an Opposition member was not acceptable to the rest of the Senate and who has helped increase instability in Australian politics for years to come, is now trying to find an excuse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  excuse is that the Government has deliberately set out to include me as a delegate to wreck the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Australians are rather amused and yet bewildered to find that their own members of the Senate on the Liberal side have voted in this chamber to deny a Liberal senator from South Australia a place on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention at a meeting held in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition has been put forward that the Government set out deliberately to destroy the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention by proposing an additional Government member in place of the one of the 3 senators to whom the Opposition was entitled and that that Government member apparently was  Senator Hall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the matter of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention I think it is right that if the Opposition is: to have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that the recognised principle is that the Opposition has the right to select who represents it at such things as this <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I indicated, that proposal was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the cost of hospital care of Pensioners is a Commonwealth responsibility, will the Minister undertake an urgent review of the present situation, so that the Commonwealth, by increasing its contribution in this area to the States can fulfil its <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referenda were held in December 1973 on the questions of vesting in the Australian Parliament full <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to control incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741031_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the amendment to the bill recommended by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights of women who play the traditional role in society will be protected, as will the interests of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the amendment to the bill recommended by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights of women who play the traditional role in society will be protected, as will the interests of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no doubt that in this and a number of other important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases it is quite disturbing that in the ordinary course decisions may not be given to resolve matters until a very considerable time passes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there exists in the mind of any Minister of the Crown, either now or in the future, the view that Parliament will be deprived of the right of knowing how its money will be spent and that that information will be withheld by the abolition of a method now available to Parliament for the first time perhaps in 60 years, then we will have reached a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the matter of the interpretation of the 1965 compact insofar as it relates to new policies should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) I should seek leave of the Senate to move a motion which, if passed, would refer the interpretation of new policies to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate refrains from the determination of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights in respect of the proposed change in the contents of the annual Appropriation Bills and resolves to consider such Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think that in terms of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and parliamentary propriety the attention of the Treasury should be drawn to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the matters were small they served to remind the Committee that no action had been taken on the recommendation that it had made in November of last year in respect of referring this matter for consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are matters of profound <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance affecting, as they do, the powers of the Senate, and as such I believe that they merit the consideration of all honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the appropriate time I shall move for reference of this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said, I note that the Estimates Committee in presenting a report to the Committee of the Whole has now re-affirmed the recommendation that was made to the Committee of the Whole in November 1973 by Estimates Committee C. The recommendation was that the matter of the interpretation of the 1965 compact insofar as it relates to new policies should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the letter that he read from my colleague the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  that was tendered to the 1973 Estimates Committee, and without necessarily committing the Government at this stage, I personally can see no reason why the Senate as a whole, and indeed the Government, should object to the matter being referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the amendment to the bill recommended by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights of women who play the traditional role in society will be protected, as will the interest of children <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are opposed to such action on the grounds that there has been ample time to discuss the bill with the community, and we are informed and.believe that many submissions have been considered by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee and the report of that committee is substantially in accord with the Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the inclusion in Sub-section 54(2) of the Family Law Bill of the Clause recommended in paragraph 67(f) (2) of the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which will allow ‘any fact or circumstance’ to be taken into account when considering maintenance, completely alters the whole concept of specific guidelines, as now set out in Section 54, and we oppose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Dawson  said he believed the ALAO had a staff of solicitors who offered advice to people with problems relating to Federal law, including matrimonial and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It originated as a matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance in 1963 when  Senator Murphy  sat somewhere near where I sit at the present moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding that I am talking of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue, the facts are that during the time that I have had the responsibility of asking the Department of the Treasury for money I have never had any difficulty on behalf of the Senate in obtaining the money required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is that the Senate at the present moment is constitutionally pinioned by putting all the appropriations of Parliament into the ordinary annual services of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also involved in three other elements of the Constitution because, constitutionally, applications can be changed by the judicial judgment of the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a fourth method by which <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice can be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr Acting  Deputy President,  I seek leave to move the motion which I foreshadowed in the debate last Tuesday, 12 November, relating to the report of Estimates Committee C, to refer a matter to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And that the Committee consider and report to the Senate upon the means by which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right of the Senate to amend proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for expenditure on matters other than the ordinary annual services of the Government may be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important point is that if ever there were a Bill before the Senate for rejection on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grounds it should be this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are opposed to such action on the grounds that there has been ample time to discuss the bill with the community, and we are informed and believe that many submissions have been considered by <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee and the report of that Committee is substantially in accord with the Family Law Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened with great respect to my learned friend,  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack, who says by interjection that there is a matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety involved in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like the Minister to state quite clearly and unequivocally to the Committee why there has been this departure from parliamentary propriety and parliamentary practice, and also why the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities have been eroded by the executive government when Parliament seeks money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding on this point I want to emphasise another point raised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- a matter which, again, was raised by  Senator Missen  in his speech to the Senate on 29 October 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The history of this Bill is that it came into this Senate in August this year and was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill which was drawn up by lawyers, which has been adjudicated on entirely by lawyers because the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is, I think, comprised entirely of lawyers, and which, if it becomes law, will then be interpreted by judges and lawyers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that this Senate and the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs have not sought to put the situation right, because for whatever reason the Committee’s report presented a part of  Mr Justice  Selby ‘s evidence in such a way that he at least feels that he has been misrepresented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs,  Mr Justice  Selby is quoted as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the measure has been put down we have had the benefit of a report from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in 1971  Senator Murphy  was able to persuade the Senate to refer to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs the following matter: The law and administration of divorce, custody and family matters with particular regard to oppressive delays, costs, indignities and other injustices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate decided to refer to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that it was on the initiative of  Senator Murphy  that this Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether those senators who have spoken in the debate, particularly those who have spoken today, have read the report so ably placed before the Parliament by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am assured by members of the Standing Committee that  Senator Murphy  has acceded substantially to the overwhelming majority of recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know this is not so, and the abundant evidence which was placed before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs by reputable people, people engaged in this jurisdiction, people who have spent a great portion of their working lives in this area, shows clearly and concisely that this Bill simply changes the concept of divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am struck by the words and the views of people like Judge Butnett of South Australia who drew the attention of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to facts which I had not considered previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were many witnesses to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee from a wide variety of organisations including the Law Council of Australia and groups from Western Australia associated with the legal fraternity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that it will adopt the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for its report and for many of the recommendations and comments by the Committee on the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them are certainly the result of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs following its examination of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has already been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, as I have said, but many more amendments have since been proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senate procedures, at some stage after 16 August the names of the members of that committee were communicated to the  President  and the Committee- the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- was formally constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs ought to be considered and the views ought to be able to be taken into account by those who are interested in the ultimate form which this legislation will take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To really understand that you have to go to the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which is a time consuming task as I can assure anyone who wants to undertake it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stop there in my reading simply to say that I would have thought that there is considerable doubt as to whether, in regard to that proposed jurisdiction, there is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for such a court to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how this problem can be resolved if the Senate is of the opinion that such a court should be established, but I urge the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  to consider the problems with which the Commonwealth Government was faced after the High Court decisions of Knight v. Knight and Kotzis v. Kotzis in 1970, because the result of those High Court decisions was that awards of maintenance and awards of custody made by commissioners of Supreme Courts who had been unconstitutionally invested with a jurisdiction which the High Court declared they did not have, were orders and awards without any valid operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in some way this issue as to whether there is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power can be raised for consideration before it is acted upon- supposing that the clauses go through- I think that a lot of the problems in the future can be resolved, because it would be absolutely disastrous to have a family court established as a Commonwealth court of record in which the decisions made by that court were not sustained by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have the same <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework as America has but we ought to recognise that there are different types of family court structures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to have one in Australia which is consonant with our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations and divisions of power as determined by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I read elsewhere in this report, the family court is to be a superior court of record, there is no question of in general judges being appointed for life; it is a matter of law and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that every judge of a Federal Court should be appointed for life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fraught with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Embarrassments upon embarrassments will be caused if constitutionally the situation cannot be sustained and in terms of appointments, structures, staff and court buildings it will add an enormous expense in an area where there is no occasion for those enormous problems to be encountered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the amendment to the Bill recommended by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights of women who play the traditional role in society will be protected, as will the interests of the children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it saying that the State Government should not dare to challenge the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> claims that have been embodied in this legislation which this Government has passed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was developed on the Rights of Magna Carta to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free men and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement, the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he read anything in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs about counselling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the long title simply recites the 2 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> heads of power pursuant to which this legislation is placed before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to  Senator James  McClelland ‘s attitude and his reference to the Festival of Light, this was a very poor exhibition by no less a person than the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to have to say this to the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee but I repeat that this Committee took evidence only in relation to this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that a good deal of the Bill deals with marriage dissolution but the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power extends further than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Everett referred to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this Bill has some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects which ought not to be overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that extent I think the name of the Bill goes beyond what could be regarded and ought properly to be regarded as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so I should perhaps point out to  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson that I think  Senator Everett  referred to the long title of the Bill in the context of saying that that really reflected the use of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose in the Senate chamber where we are not concerned fundamentally with where <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power ultimately lies one cannot speak in terms other than the risk of what is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe all will go well until at some late stage a person will rely upon a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point and the edifice will come tumbling down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> provision is quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These words are words of caution and if we are to embark, as this legislation proposes, upon giving to the Commonwealth a wide power and to give to all the instrumentalities to be established by this Bill power to make decrees and orders on applications of that character and subsequently they should be found to be invalid as beyond <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, it is fair to say that people will be denied what they believed they had received and were entitled to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The amendment which  Senator Greenwood  has moved goes to the very heart of this Bill and certainly to the very heart of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs because, if it succeeds and if these amendments are made to the definition of matrimonial cause’, we may be sure that practically all that is sought of substance in the Bill will be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very valuable work on this precise subject- the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth to regulate family relations- by Professor Sackville, who is known to all honourable senators, and by Professor Howard, who is the General Counsel to the Attorney-General, is reported in the 1974 Federal Law Review at page 30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing is clear: lt is not suggested that this approach ought not to be taken if it can constitutionally be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, no argument is raised against the desirability of the definition, if that can be done constitutionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask the Senate not to alter the definition because to do so would really take away the features of this legislation which I think have been generally applauded as very great advances and if they are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> they are eminently in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Sir Garfield  Barwick and the Parliament in 1959 looked at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and they sought, consistently with earlier definitions, to limit the operation of the Act to that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I invite him to consider that if in this area <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power is lacking legislation will not rectify the position because there is no Commonwealth power to rectify it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know how the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs adverted to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is that I do not advocate this because of some hope or desire alone that this is within <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest that all these powers should be put within the ambit of matrimonial cause and should be transferred, in my opinion and the opinion of some members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, in many cases to the State courts, which are to be known as family courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the proper forum to try to analyse the width of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the view that the Commonwealth has not exhausted its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in this area finds support from the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After careful attention, careful consideration and careful draftsmanship, it is considered that this fits within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am satisfied that we should proceed and not be deterred by what is suggested by  Senator Greenwood  about possible lack of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again I urge  Senator Greenwood  to study the document which emerged from the deliberations of the Senate <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to this matter the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommended: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the amendments proposed by the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs were adopted by the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  and that is why he has been moving them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice- I think I am correct in saying this-that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs did not make any recommendation with regard to this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been talking to the  Chairman  of the Senate <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee and he and I both have a distinct recollection that when this matter was discussed by that Committee the feeling was that the whole of the words proposed in the AttorneyGeneral ‘s original amendment No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Greenwood will be pleased to hear that, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, I agree with the observations he makes with respect to clause 14 (6) (a) regarding the words ‘an opportunity to consider’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that this is one of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I make is that the Committee considered that amendment was desirable in order to increase the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> strength of the power contained in the proposed new clause 14a- in other words, that the availability of the counselling facilities should be pursuant to a formal filing of a document invoking those facilities in the Family Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other argument prevailed strongly on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when making its recommendation to change ‘notice of marriage breakdown’ to notice’ so that a person can seek the counselling facilities of the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs took the matter as far as that in its considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is desired by the members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to extend that so that people do not necessarily have to institute divorce proceedings to secure a settlement of property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it will probably have greater <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity than if the proposed clause were not there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate what  Senator Baume  is putting, but the ever present concern is that which was mentioned earlier this evening, that is, the question of constitutionality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you give assistance to a person as a person you might be getting into something that is not quite as related to marriage or to the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> heads of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suppose that anybody will greatly challenge it, but some attention has been paid to the available heads of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power even in that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, whilst I fully appreciate and can see the points which the Attorney-General makes about the need to have regard to the head of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, this is a facilitatory area in which one would not believe that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions are likely to cause concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought, without harking back to an earlier debate, that there is more problem about heads of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in other areas than in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is based on the recommendation contained in paragraph 30 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommended that there should be a Family Court of Australia which was to be a superior court of record, and that the jurisdiction ought to be vested in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first purpose is to take full advantage of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Australian Government in relation to exchange control regulation of the financial aspects of overseas transactions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to say a few words on this matter because undoubtedly the creation of the Family Court, whether it be Federal entirely or State and Federal, is of great interest to the members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, lt was, of course, a major part of the recommendations that that Committee put forward- that there certainly should be a family court taking up all the jurisdictions which were otherwise spread in a great mass of courts, in different ways, and which were a constant cause of jumping from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the cause likewise of cost and of frustration for litigants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that this Senate will see the wisdom of adding to that the State concept which the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee recommended and mentioned in its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the second reading debate I. made a comment about the place of family courts and  Senator James  McClelland indicated by way of interjection that some of the things I was hoping family courts could achieve probably had no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limit to what can be done by the Commonwealth I think we have a pretty strong argument for inviting the States to be involved in the setting up and operation of family courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have read and re-read what the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs said about this matter of a family court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there is a recognition that because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitation that judges must be appointed for life, there are problems which the Committee wants to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to appoint officers to State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the probable division of labour between the Superior Court and courts of summary jurisdiction be in inverse relationship to the intricacy of the respective subject matters with which they will be dealing, but important areas of family law will, for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons remain outside the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drawing support from what Professor Finlay has said I emphasise that he recognised this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitation upon this concept of family law which the Bill is not prepared to recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all of these factors are indications of some limitation upon the efficacy of a Commonwealth Family Court on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis and in the area of jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee is entirely in agreement with the idea that you cannot reform the summary courts and get them sufficiently into the position where they can deal properly with these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three members of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee advocate State courts and this is contained in the report as a suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought it would have struck him right at the outset as having <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which he would not have thought would have been so easily passed over as, in fact, they have been passed over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agreed, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, to amendment No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They owe allegiance to the Crown as do members of Parliament and all other officers who are charged with responsibilities which are part of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> frame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we put the remainder of the clause that deals with the Family Court I wonder if the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  or the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs would inform me whether the proposed amendments with regard to the establishment of the Family Court have embraced some of the comments that were made in the Senate Committee’s report with regard to the functions and activities which we would hope would be envisaged in the service that this Court would give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an amendment which the Liberal members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs at least, consider of great importance to the operation of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations and other limitations which flow from the very provisions of this Bill, the State Family Courts must be inferior, they must be second class compared with the Federal Family Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fourth point is that judges of State family courts could not, because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations, exercise the jurisdiction which would be conferred on the Federal Family Court under proposed sections 17m(1), 17m(2), 17ma and 17n because those proposed sections deal with a jurisdiction which flows from the Marriage Act and that could not, except by the leave of this Parliament, be conferred on State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, it seems to me that this section departs from the whole notion of a family court as that Committee saw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in this piece of legislation- subject to the argument which has gone on before in which  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Everett  have perhaps been the main protagonists- we have to see this matter at this stage of the Committee debate as a proper exercise of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the sort of exercise of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth which detracts in any way from the powers of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am perfectly confident, as is  Senator Everett,  that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment on this issue could be carried, it there was the will to do so, as a way of resolving this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs will recollect that it was a judge of that court- Judge Burnettwho I think probably persuaded the Committee more than any other witness, of the value and importance of a Family Court exercising jurisdiction under this type of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it extraordinary, in view of the record of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments- defeat after defeat- that anybody in this chamber would believe it is a simple solution to have the Constitution amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, we would avoid all the incipient <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems that I can foresee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the interests of having the Bill passed, I am agreeable to altering this in accordance with the wish of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, that is, to propose that the 12 months must elapse before the filing of the application for dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This amendment stems from an unanimous recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had the opportunity, as have all honourable senators, to read the reports of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and also to read the transcripts of evidence which were made available to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 25 of the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs appears the following statement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I found the proceedings of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee of considerable help when I was examining this question of where we stand with regard to matrimonial fault and trying to make up my mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obviously a matter which gave the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee considerable concern and which exercised it for a considerable time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I looked further into the evidence presented to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee went as far as looking at a provisional draft for a possible second ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was sufficiently concerned and uncertain about this matter to go into it in great depth and detail to examine just what place matrimonial fault had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Acting Deputy President, I bring up the report of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory relating to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> developments in the Northern Territory, together with the minutes of evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pleasure in presenting to the Parliament the report by the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory on ‘<span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development in the Northern Territory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first words of evidence given to the Committee were ‘the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory represents a complex and unique problem’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> development is a step by step forward movement and the next step in this process in the Territory is the granting of some executive responsibility to the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Government’s authority is being challenged, not by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes, not through the courts, not in the Parliament and not in the ballot box, but by extraconstitutional means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That whereas our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary democracy was developed on the Rights ofthe Magna Carta to preserve for all time to the Australian people their cherished right to live as free nien and women, enjoying complete liberty of worship, assembly, speech, movement, the communication of knowledge and information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B) The prevention of any attempt of similar action by all <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and legal means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-0-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Leader of the Government in the Senate aware that the Government of the State of Victoria recently invited certain Victorian senators to a Cabinet meeting to discuss so-called State rights <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present an interim report from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on its inquiry into the clauses of the National Compensation Bill 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thai the date for presenting the report of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the clauses ofthe National Compensation Bill 1974 bc extended until 30 April 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware of paragraph 55 of the report ofthe Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in which the Committee recognised that there may well be differences of views regarding the appropriate period of separation in proving irretrievable breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having studied the Bill and the report ‘of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, he said that he has some doubts about the one year separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, the 12 months period is favoured by the majority of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the relative committee of the Law Council of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense my judgment has been determined by the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs of which I was a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intervene at this stage to seek some clarification from the Attorney-General or from some member of the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am prompted to speak very briefly in this debate because earlier today  Senator Baume  referred to some questions which as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs I had asked during the course of the Committee’s investigation of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further- this is the result of the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs -if the court is in doubt as to whether proper arrangments have been made in relation to the children, it may adjourn the proceedings until a report regarding those arrangements has been obtained from a welfare officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he gave evidence -some time ago now-  Mr Justice  Selby, who was the first witness to appear before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, stressed the point that people really must be encouraged to work at their marriages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to  Senator James  McClelland, that is not what the law is, and I am surprised at the cursory treatment that was given to this matter by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clauses of the Bill were referred to a Committee of the Senate- the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in line with the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs was of the opinion that it was not necessary to impose a standard that the child had to establish was necessary for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I saw what the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will probably have greater <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity because there already will be proceedings in the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of situation which the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs had in mind was one where a man of some means- I am not talking about a man who won the lottery or about a millionaire; I am talking about a man of some means- obtained a divorce after one year’s separation from a wife who may have been entirely unwilling to agree to the divorce but who, because of this law, has been divorced and she was clearly entitled to maintenance, and substantial maintenance, for herself and the children of the marriage and obtained such an order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is desired by the 6 members of the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is to insert at the commencement of that clause the amendment I have just moved so that it would then begin with the words: ‘Subject to the provisions of Section 55 (3)’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is desired by the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is that clause 55 (3) should be read with sub-clause (4a), otherwise they would appear to be inconsistent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs considered that the words which I seek to add at the end of subclause ( 1 ) were desirable; in other words, that irrespective of intention, if the making of the instrument or disposition had the effect of defeating claims then it was liable to be set aside by the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that in my participation in the second reading debate I urged delay because I thought the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs should have been circulated and understood by the public and that public opinion should have become vocal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also would like to associate myself with the remarks just made by  Senator Wood  and I think I can do so on behalf of my colleagues on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Very briefly, as the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to which this matter was referred for examination in some detail, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of  Senator Durack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which examined this measure presented 2 reports, and those reports were not available to the public until the day on which the debate in this Parliament commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also thank the  Chairman  and members of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one thing to consider a high <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position but the point is whether this principle should be extended to a whole range of citizens, the permanent and temporary employees of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is to take full advantage of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Australian Government, particularly in relation to exchange control regulations where they have regard to financial transactions overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is a machinery measure designed to meet legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements associated with the Government’s financial transactions and accounting arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an urgent need for the Commonwealth Government to recognise our traditional <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities and act accordingly to ensure that the resource of people and material is not wasted as at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the requirement will be extended to encompass proposals which involve the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These extensions merely use Australian Government <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers which, because of the indifference of earlier government to environmental issues, were never applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the view- I go back to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis of this Senate- that we have the right to review legislation and to amend or reject it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Senate has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has consistently supported the British Government’s Five Principles as the basis for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement in Rhodesia, especially the fifth principle that any basis proposed for independence must be acceptable to the black majority of Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate, as I said in my speech on the second reading of this Bill, that with this sort of power being extended by Bill after Bill passed by this House, the States are rapidly becoming <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> skeletons and ultimately will become unnecessary in the system of Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, to me, is the final insult to the States, which are already rapidly becoming <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> skeletons within the so-called Australian federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I predict that if this sort of legislation continues to pass through this House in numerous forms on various subjects but with a similarity of control the States will rapidly, as I have said, become <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> skeletons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise to second the amendment moved by  Senator Durack  and to speak on this matter as a layman and also as a member of the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory, which inquired into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must be remembered that it was not this Parliament, not the Opposition, not any element of the Parliament other than the Government which moved in August 1973 that the Parliament should set up a joint committee which had as its special reference the responsibility of reporting on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of self government in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the second objective of the Government the Minister has moved quickly to give effect to the first stage of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Northern Territory, namely, a fully elected Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of referral of State powers was raised by the Prime Minister at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in September 1973 and has been pursued subsequently with the States but with no results, so far as the non-Labor States are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-71-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the amendments tend to delimit the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> assumptions which are made by the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are exceeding our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in the Bill it would seem that there is another place where that can be dealt with rather than here in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am no lawyer, but there might be some argument about the application of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple answer to that is that the effect of the Bill and therefore the application of the administrative procedures cannot transcend the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not apply to any matters which are outside the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only hope that one day by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum the powers of the Australian Parliament will be increased so that this measure can be a much more embracing one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-62-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides for the establishment of the Australian Housing Corporation which is being created to strengthen the Australian Government machinery to perform those housing functions for which the Australian Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the limitations necessarily imposed by the overall demand on its financial resources the Government will from time to time make housing loans available to families and to those other specific categories of home seekers within the Australian Government’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sees this Corporation as the instrument to assist many groups of people who fall within its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility but who do not have ready access to the forms of housing assistance at present available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1 974 -yet to be considered by House of Representatives National Compensation Bill 1974 -report on Clauses by Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs due 30 April 1 975 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear also that the Opposition would be no more able to exercise effective controls over wages and salaries than is the Government at the present time because of the lack of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, but at least this Government has taken the initiative to support the proposal for the indexation of wages now before the Arbitration Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Drake-Brockman  has acknowledged, the Bill is before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs, on the motion of an Australian Labor Party senator, my distinguished colleague  Senator Everett,  Q.C., who moved that there be a further inquiry into the matter by the Senate Standing Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware that  Senator Murphy,  as he then was, gave any opinion to the Government on the constitutionality of the Bill in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not relevant for him to pass on the constitutionality or otherwise of the Bill because the Government was proceeding always on the basis that it did have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis to present this Bill to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventionsthe manner of filling casual vacancies in the Senate- is threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The precedent was followed 6 times in the next 6 years, and in 1958 the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review reported on the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Committee had already reported to the Parliament it sought a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> formula to require the Parliament or Governor of a State in making an appointment to fill a casual vacancy arising in the Senate, to choose some one who was a member of the same political party as the senator whose place had become vacant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this juncture, the Committee merely reiterates its view, expressed in the first report, that all members who sat on the Committee thought the principle should continue to be observed without exception so that the matter may become the subject of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention or understanding which political parties will always observe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> vandalism demands that all democrats stand up and be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could he permit a lifetime of dedicated and passionate support for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions to be compromised by running for cover when faced with a question of prinicple? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, of which  Senator Wright  was a member, which brought down a report in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee desired to recommend a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment whereby, if the senator for a State whose place has become vacant was a member of a political party, the Parliament of the State or the Governor of the State should be required, in filling the vacancy, to choose a person who was a member of the same political party as the vacating senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that circumstance, particularly from the point of view of the State governments in this country, surely the Senate is the only braking force that those governments have in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> backing for that sort of thing or is this just the changing of a practice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will find that he has taken <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advice and, much against his will, he has decided, even though it would have been better for the people pf Australia if he had proceeded to put somebody from his party or the Country Party into the Senate, all things considered that he will not go ahead with his proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are an elected house of Parliament and we have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we have been elected we are able to function and accept the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind them that the election last May did return a number of senators who in a particular sense are capable of exercising <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement in regard to the filling of a casual vacancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that the present situation is evidence of the reaction of a State Government when it has an opportunity to use its <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power under section 15 of the Constitution to show its displeasure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also support it with a feeling of sadness in that I look across at the Opposition benches and I see a number of honourable senators who, over a long period of years, have proclaimed their insistence on the observance of the Constitution and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions; yet on this issue and in this context, purely to give some protective ointment to the Premier of New South Wales they retreat from those convictions that they have professed so strongly over such a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last Monday, when the Premier of New South Wales first made the threat that is the subject of this debate, was a black day for parliamentary integrity; it was a black day for respect for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention throughout this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least until after the Premiers Conference tomorrow  Mr Lewis  has given himself a let-out because he has appointed a sub-committee to consider the legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications of his threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wright  has interjected, I remind him that he was a member of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which reported in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review said in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a jack booted deprivation of their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The article by an academic in the ‘Australian’ today to which I have referred suggests, as I have said, the next counter move in this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> game of chess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what happens once people start to tinker with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope I never see the day- I would have thought that the professed upholders of the Constitution would never want to see the day- when matters of this nature will be the subject of chess moves of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> character in order to gain political advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To my mind that argument ignores the fact that the courts are interpreting matters, so far as the High Court is concerned, of extreme <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and social concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be quite wrong to describe his practice as confined to industrial or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959 recommended in paragraph 59 and 60 of its report as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee desired to recommend a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment whereby, if the senator for a Sta”; whose place has become vacant was a member of a political party, the Parliament of the State or the Governor of the State should be required, in filling the vacancy, to choose a person who was a member of the same political party as the vacating senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is probably one of the reasons why in the past the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review found difficulty in phrasing an amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My re-reading of the debate satisfies me that  Senator Withers  was making the important point that the way in which the Federal Government of this country has in recent months and years treated the States, the actions by the Government both in regard to the Gair affair and in regard to the interference by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment with the States’ rights in regard to the Senate by introducing non-State representatives and also the attacks that have constantly been made on States and the infringement of their powers have left many State leaders in a position where they considerably fear the intentions of this Government, and I think justifiably so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal Party as the great upholder of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> tradition in this country and the great upholder of the position of the Senate does not view this possible departure from that convention with the greatest concern and if it attempts to substitute that view of greatest concern with one of commendation, it will be a somewhat meek and mealy-mouthed form of the tradition which has prevailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sad that the Party of  Sir Robert  Menzies which in 1 95 1 , defeated on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill by the decision of the High Court, took appropriate steps constitutionallysteps which a Party in that position should take- and sought a referendum to obtain power in connection with that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second purpose is mainly to take advantage of this occasion to put on record the ramshackle situation that is left in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions with regard to casual vacancies in this place which I have lived to learn has become much more important even in my time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if I go further and say that it would be fair in political discussion for people to be anxious as to the purpose of the appointment- that the Attorney-General who promoted certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> claims which are being contested by the States should be translated from the AttorneyGeneralship to the High Court for the purpose of giving weight in the adjudication o.” <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the third point about it is that these disciples of elevated <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> integrity- I notice that  Senator Everett  is out of the chamber at the moment, and I wish expressly to bring him within the aura of the phrase- ought to give credit to the Opposition in the Senate when it does maintain the Constitution and established conventions, and when the Opposition goes further and commends to the parliaments of the States the practice that has been observed in this regard they might become a little generous in their understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions and conventions the Opposition commends the acceptance of and compliance with the practices that have been observed in regard to section 15. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us proceed to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to section 15 of the Constitution, the Parliament could not go on and fulfil completely in the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act the only method by which proportionalrepresentation could be completely applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am discussing this matter constitutionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may take the view that having that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility they are bound to take into consideration all sorts of matters affecting the public interest of this Commonwealth and their State as well as the practice that has been developed in connection with filling casual vacancies since 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the added importance of casual vacancies as a result of proportional representation ensuring fairly evenly divided Senates, it was recommended that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision for the rilling of casual vacancies should be reviewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was understood by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, of which I was a member, as was the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review considered providing the review that the double dissolution committee had recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As reported in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee’s report the Committee found it impossible to devise a provision which would allow for the transmission of votes according to party nomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we might reflect that there were the greatest difficulties before the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee in writing in a specific provision that would become <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law requiring that the successor on a casual vacancy should be a member of the same party as the vacating senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One need only state these points to see that it is quite inappropriate, as the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review decided, to write a rigid formula of words into the Constitution to give effect to this practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an appointment to the High Court is for the purpose of giving strength to a judicial position by the participation of an Attorney-General who has already advised on highly important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters- I do not say that is the position, I previously referred to it by way of explanationif the nominee of a political party was on other than political grounds completely unacceptable to the big majority of the members of the State Houses, if a member of a political party had changed his political allegiance during his membership of the Senate or if he were a sole independent person in the Senate who had no right to have any political succession attributed to him, the practice is ill defined and demands the judgment of those responsible for its application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the States concede their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to fill a casual vacancy they could refer that power to the Parliament of the Commonwealth and enable the Commonwealth, having got rid of section 15, to go on and add to the present truncated proportional representation provisions, those provisions that would enable casual vacancies to be filled in accordance with those principles by a transfer and a recount of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I to be attacked as subverting the Constitution when I point out that in accordance with its provisions the practice might be translated into a convention or even into a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought in a highly contentious political arena such as this that it would be questionable whether a convention has been established in the full meaning of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established incontrovertibly that, in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, the sole responsibility for filling this vacancy rests with the Houses of Parliament of the State, and commending a practice that has been established in the last 25 years, I suggest that in that respect I am seeking to uphold the Constitution scrupulously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think they are as capable of assessing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and political repercussions as are members of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  simply said that the States are being challenged and their rights are being encroached upon by many Acts of this Parliament, including a number of Acts whose <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity will come before the tribunal to which the ex-senator has been appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of our amendment was to make 2 statements- a statement as to who actually has the legal right to make the appointment, which cannot be quibbled at because it is a legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right, and a second statement on the procedure we believed States should follow when there is a casual vacancy in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that today I received a letter from the Leader of the Government in the Senate nominating  Senator Grimes  to be a member of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives effect to the principle recommended by the all party Joint Parliamentary Committees on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1958 and 1959 that the terms of senators should be changed from fixed terms of 6 years, to 2 terms of the House of Representatives so that the elections for both Houses of our Parliament would take place simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the view of all but one member of the Joint Committees on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment now proposed will give senators a term of service equal to 2 terms of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would hope that on this occasion the Opposition will treat this Bill with the objectivity that marked the consideration of this difficult problem in the Joint Committees on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review during the 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committees recommended this reform there had only been 3 occasions on which an election had been held for one house alone- for the House of Representatives in 1929 and 1954 and for the Senate in 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one way in which simultaneous elections of the Senate and the House of Representatives can be assured at all times and that is by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment that is proposed in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appeals from the High Court in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and other federal matters have been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appeals from all State Courts in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and federal matters have been abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court was not confined, as is the Supreme Court of the United States of America, to federal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has since had discussions with the United Kingdom Prime Minister and it has been decided that the best course to resolve these issues is to reintroduce the Bill, and to give every opportunity for questions as to its validity to be raised in the High Court of Australia, in accordance with proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little support for any fundamental change in the existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system or for the overthrow of existing democratic institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each has a particular function, and each is based upon a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was no accident that the lengthiest and most detailed section of that document dealt directly with cities, centres, regions, and local government and the social, financial and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions associated with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, we cannot say that we have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in certain areas of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also clear that it will continue to deny him that possibility and that it will deny him access to the scalpel of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment whereas he still has access to what I would call the bludgeon of section 96 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In part IV of that platform, on the first page, we find a series of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters for which the Labor Party stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would like to talk to the Senate about is the fact that the Labor Party has seen a second way of doing this, an indirect way which perhaps has got around the need for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments that it claims in its platform that it wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at the published documents of the Labor Party, and in particular to some of the addresses of its present leader and the present Prime Minister of Australia,  Mr Whitlam,  they will find a fairly clear indication of why the Labor Party finds the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements in Australia quite unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the speech which I have just quoted he canvassed a number of ways in which Labor could tackle <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform either through ordinary amendment or by using different devices such as State governments referring powers to the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a reference to the Constitution, after stressing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties in the way of a Labor Government, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it has not put forward <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments which would achieve all the objectives which are set out in the platform, it has certainly put forward a series of amendments which go some of the way and which achieve some of those aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a little strange that it took the ALP as long as it did to get on to the idea that section 96 could be used to solve the real problem that it has, namely, that the Australian people do not want it to change the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely say at this stage that if I obtain leave to continue my remarks later I propose to deal with the actual figures which have been thrown up in the last 2 years’ Budget Papers and which indicate that the use of section 96 has expanded enormously under this Government and has reduced the ability of State governments to carry out in any true fashion their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While noting that other motions considered at the meeting calling for stringent action are still the subject of a postal ballot, I ask: ( 1 ) Is the Minister aware of the strong objections of most Victorian solicitors to the development of a Government service under no statutory authority, operating beyond the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth and under no agreement or arrangement with other legal aid services which have operated effectively in this area for many years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the House of Representatives is brought to an election in a period shorter than the period of 3 years for which it was elected, of what concern is that to the Senate, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> chamber of this Parliament of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it to change the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship between the 2 Houses of Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No democracy can survive if it has not a responsible and recognisable brake within its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> set-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Scott also has to explain, as does  Senator Wood,  why such sinister interpretations were not placed upon a proposal such as we are advancing when the matter was considered back in 1958 and 1959 by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is not suggested that the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review was some sort of subversive bolshevist organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even if the external affairs power were exclusive, and there is nothing in the Commonwealth Constitution to make it- so, relations between the United Kingdom and the States on matters that form pan of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of the States, such as the position of a State Governor or appeals to Her Majesty in Council, are clearly not external affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be to deny history and the very essence of State <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> institutions to describe <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationships with the United Kingdom as an external affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle was affirmed in 1935 by the Report by the Joint Committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons appointed to consider the Petition of the State of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are told that it should be done, first of all, by means of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which in fact was aborted in its activities by action taken by the Opposition in the Senate only a few months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, but we have heard so much about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of all the referendum campaigns we have been told that these matters should be left to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this legislation comes before the Senate we are told that this matter should be left to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When this legislation comes before the Senate we are told that this matter should be left to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is lacking in an approach to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is any enthusiasm to get on with it and to get on with any of thes issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has become a large filing tray in which the Opposition can insert anything it does not want to deal with at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Opposition, it will all be left until the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention may be asked at some stage to consider this matter; but, if the Opposition thinks it is right now that appeals to the Privy Council should be abolished, now is the time to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that all arguments in relation to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law should be confined to those who have been trained to argue legal cases and who, in political terms, move into the area of sophistry and do not acknowledge that nations are built to a large degree on an emotional content. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that if the Opposition was sincere in saying that appeals to the Privy Council ought to be abolished, that the High Court ought to be the final court of appeal within Australia, then it would have supported this Bill albeit expressing whatever reservations it might have as to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Greenwood  used that as an argument he was using it in the context of a division of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, if this legislation transcends <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power it will be struck down by the High Court in the proper and normal way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does not transcend <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal power, then it achieves a purpose that the Opposition says it wishes to see achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was that there should be no appeal from a decision of the High Court on a matter involving the limits inter se of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth, and those of any State or States without the certificate of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not take the view that it is proper to debate the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legality of measures at any length. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that although contrary views have been taken by others over recent years the Government has been advised that it is constitutionally proper for it to submit this legislation to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the Opposition would have shown its sincerity in its expressed desire to abolish appeals to the Privy Council if it had put its opposition to this measure more on the basis of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal power if it wanted to oppose, or if it had taken the alternative course of saying: ‘We support this Bill because it achieves the result which we wish to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise with some hesitation to respond to him because I fear the man who commences his argument on a purely <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal matter, parading sincerity and finishing on sincerity, putting forward an argument which was hopelessly inadequate in the Labor conference in Launceston and expecting it to be effective here in the Senate; that is especially so when that exponent of sincerity went to London as a member of the 6-State delegation to argue the proposition that the Commonwealth was incompetent to request this legislation and that it was the prerogative of the States to say whether or not an appeal from the States’ common law jurisdiction should be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I will return to the Deputy Premier and Attorney-General of Tasmania, who used the unique, unprecedented <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> occasion of unanimity on the part of the 6 States to impress London with the argument that it was the States and the States alone who had the authority under the Statute of Westminster to request an amendment to the right of citizens of the States to appeal to the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first argument that sincere people should advance is one that is governed by self discipline and one to which, by all the proprieties of lifeconstitutional ones not accepted- and the decencies of citizens’ rights, they feel bound to abide by. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one comes into a Federal Parliament one has other parameters, but they are equally definite and they are denned by one’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With those guidelines, sincere people desiring to expose but not to expand the true <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limits would say: ‘When Federation was established we established a High Court and a federal judiciary’, which in relation to the next Bill to be debated by the Senate I shall try to demonstrate that the Government is seeking to confuse and condemn the country by exploitation ‘but in the State sphere we maintained the Supreme Courts, the State judiciaries, the State Constitutions, the State powers and the State laws’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only question for sincere people to consider on this occasion is whether we have guiding ourselves a sense of self discipline or an expansionist idea, as  Dr Cairns  had on ‘ Monday Conference ‘ last night, to fly by the seat of the pants on the last impulsive notion that comes to us on the basis that we are a self established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that a stern admirer of consistency such as  Senator Wright  would have raised his voice in support of the principle which he enunciated as long ago as 1959 as a member of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review when he went along with this proposition: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Wright is a man who manages to be vocal on matters of some triviality and I would have thought on this most important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter of the day we would have heard from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is some doubt as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Parliament to pass this legislation and if  Senator Greenwood  holds the High Court in such reverence, why is he so reluctant to allow the High Court to decide this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only this afternoon when we were discussing the question of a referendum to decide another matter we found a lot of approbium poured on the idea that the Australian Parliament should be called upon to decide matters of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate on the report the Senate resolved that the Standing Committees on Health and Welfare, Social Environment and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs should continually oversight the report and recommend from time to time the further measures which might be taken to implement the recommendation or overcome the problems revealed in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these areas would be more appropriately dealt with by the Standing Committee on Social Environment and the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggested that the living environment and legislation could be more appropriately dealt with by the Standing Committee on Social Environment and the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Opposition are pleased that the Senate rejected that Bill and left the way open, if the Government will only utilise the course, of consulting with the States and involving the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention in the resolution of this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there are the inter se questions as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth and the States which the High Court may certify as properly appealable to the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The text illustrates by various doctrines of finding in the Federal courts a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue, the doctrine of pre-emption which, as I understand it, means much the same as our occupying the same field for the purpose of a test under section 109 of the Constitution, by the references to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> causes and now the underwriting of criminal cases by human rights and, I might say, the undermining of the enforcement of criminal cases by this doctrine, the utter weakness and danger of the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endeavoured to have that argument established in the report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee of which I was a member from 1956 to 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt would also add complexity to our legal system, and the 2 systems would be explicable only by an expert on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must also be seen in the light of the growing significance of Commonwealth legislation and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power whether apparent under Liberal or Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate  Senator Wright’s  chronic addiction to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> view which springs from horse and buggy days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of that growth has been that, unless the number of High Court justices is increased, there is a serious risk that the volume of work in the original jurisdiction of the High Court will inhibit the Court’s capacity to fulfil its principal role as an arbiter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions and as the nation’s ultimate appellate court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After careful consideration of the Bill, the Association is convinced the apparent theoretical advantages which have been suggested by the Government for the Superior Court are far out-weighed by other serious, practical and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact, as  Senator Everett  mentioned, that in the middle 1 960s the Law Council of Australia and some of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal bodies saw merit in the proposal for a Superior Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope we will see a system under which there is one hierarchy of courts, in which the role of the Commonwealth and the States can, by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process, be so geared that the problems which occasionally arise, the delays, the duplication and even the disputes about appointments, can be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is a case in industrial law in Australia where there is a long standing, crying evil due to the fact that we have an equivalent of the American system, that is, 2 different competing systems of law based on different <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers being exercised by State courts and by Federal courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of a family court which the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs came up with I believed should be decided upon before we proceed with the Superior Court Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of whether the Commonwealth or the States has the responsibility within the Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework for the exercise of rights arising or the performance of obligations accepted under the International Convention on the Continental Shelf and under the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone is undecided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to what Justices of the High Court have saidand all witnesses who gave evidence on this aspect generally concurred- it would appear that the Commonwealth has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate under its external affairs power to give effect to international obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do so, it would mean that in significant and, possibly, expanding areas the Commonwealth heads of power would become more extensive than the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions expressly contemplate- and, consequentially, reduce the exclusive area of State authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We assented some months ago to the first part of this Bill, which claimed for the Commonwealth sovereignty over this area in respect of minerals, whether oils or others, and we assented to that for the express purpose of enabling that intensely contentious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question to be decided by the only appropriate tribunal- the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, having given to the Government the right to test its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to mine for minerals in the off-shore zone, we are unwilling to apply to that off-shore zone- whereas to oil there is a co-operative arrangement with the States, each State administering its own designated area- an administrative patchwork, for other minerals in the same area, that has its origin in the genius of Connor to give directions on any subject notwithstanding the laws of the Australian Capital Territory purported to be applied to it and with the Minister having the right to delegate any of his powers to any officer of the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we have some machinery available to us and unless we have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in this area, obviously there is little we can do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acting as paymaster and feesetter, the Government will effectively have nationalised the medical profession even without the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must express here- I am entitled to do so- my doubts about the necessity for these 2 measures to be joined together on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> position, as we understand it, that it is rather for the national Government to retain powers unto itself than to prescribe a series of functions to be transferred to local control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, there is some question whether the Government has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to go as far as it has gone in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, when the matter is being considered again- I anticipate that this will be in the very near future- he believes that the problem is of such complexity that it should be referred, for example, to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, it would be quite open to him or to any other honourable senator so to recommend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government does not have complete <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to perform all housing functions, but it does have substantial powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, so far as it can within its resources, the Corporation will make housing loans available to families, using the family allowance provisions in the Australian Consitution, and it will also make loans to those other specific categories of home-seekers for whom the Australian Government has a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of the minor nature of the error the Government considers that, in view of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance of the Bill, it is important that it should express exactly the intention of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 should like to have the benefit of his advice and the advice of  Senator Wright  on this matter which to me is extraordinarily important in the Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us make this clear: It is no argument to say that the Commonwealth Government cannot do these things directly because of lack of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, at least some of the proposed powers are of very dubious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In rejection of that reply I make the point that of course there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations in relation to the direct intervention of the Commonwealth Government for those specific purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations covering all of the Australian people, why is the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement not ultra vires the Constitution? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is one of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers that we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately we say that we are without <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to carry out the provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All in all this is only a means of the Commonwealth exercising a power it has to overcome the many problems we have experienced in housing construction, particularly under the previous Government which made necessary such things as the undesirable homes savings grants, to overcome speculation in building which puts the price of land beyond the reach of home owners, and to bring about a situation where we have some orderly organisation in these fields over which the Australian Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether there may be any area of company activity and operation outside the ambit of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and whether there are appropriate courses e.g. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third matter is whether there may be any areas of company activity and operation outside the ambit of Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has a very full program for the rest of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator wants all the things that he has dredged up, including the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power question, to be considered by a select committee of this chamber, whose members will have primary and fundamental duties to this Senate and will have only the recess between the end of this autumn session and the commencement of the Budget session in which to hear mountains of evidence that will surely be a repetition of what has been said in the past, I suggest he is not genuine in his desire to see this legislation translated into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We referred it to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the proposed regulation of foreign corporations, financial corporations and trading corporations, the Commonwealth would appear to need an additional <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power which it does not yet have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as the last leader of the Liberal Party refused to assert his authority over  Mr Lewis  in New South Wales when he flouted a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention, so the present Leader of the Liberal Opposition has refused to exert his authority in an area which is properly the field of Commonwealth legislation without any interference from the interest of the States in legislative form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are additional matters of great importance which such a committee should consider, namely, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers which may justify this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this Bill in fact exceed the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the honourable senator would not expect any of the unfortunate members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs, who are already busily traversing the length and breadth of this great continent to inquire into the National Compensation Bill, having recently completed their Herculean labours on the Family Law Bill, should be required now to set their minds to repeating the exercise at which so many of us laboured for so long and for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we could arrange to fill in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> gaps where the Federal power is deficient I would much prefer a uniform companies law throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to possible <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of licensing stock brokers in that fragmented field and the rules relating to prospectus and the rules relating to market securities in that fragmented State field surely would impel anybody to try to get together with the States to see whether or not by some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process an effective Bill, as far as possible beyond the range of foreseeable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge, should not be brought into Parliament for both the efficacy of the industry and its integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember that from 1956 to 1959 the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review made recommendations in relation to company law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This body must have adequate power, in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am certain such an agreement would be more effective more quickly than if present incomplete Bill passes into law due to undoubted <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenges which will arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate should consider the questions I have raised, perhaps by reference to a committee where argument could be heard from those versed in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would be remiss in our own obligations and responsibilities to the Senate and to the Australian public that we serve if we allowed the serious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions that have been raised to remain the subject of contention and unresolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so we must have proper regard to our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities and to the requirements of due process since the allegation of failure to obey a specific constitional requirement is a serious matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not my intention to enter into a long debate on the constitutionality of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a curious fact that whenever changes are proposed- a number of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments have been proposed by the present Government- they always seem to be met with the stiffest opposition from the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not elected in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense as members of a political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be a good reference to send to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee to take evidence in the 6 States concerning the various Constitution and Electoral Acts and perhaps report back to the Senate as to a proper method of overcoming what I think is an injustice to members of State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I quite agree with  Senator Poyser  that there needs to be a very careful look at this from the legal, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and Electoral Act angles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition thinks that in 2 weeks we will clear up this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position which has never been challenged- there are also the other problems that we have at the present time- it is being highly optimistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Opposition is asking us to deal with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect of this problem in a very short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I could hold out any great hope to the Opposition that in the period of one, two or three weeks before the Bill is returned to the Senate we will be able to deal with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position about which nobody has ever been able to make up his mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State government insurance offices which engage in the life assurance business are not subject to the requirements which  Senator Drake-Brockman  mentioned, for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons and be&gt;cause the life policies of the State government insurance offices are guaranteed by the respective States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe there is any doubt about the intention of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision now being debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has read the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> debates will have seen what its framers desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This inquiry could take evidence from legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, the advice should not be confined to the Government because this is not a political matter; it is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and parliamentary matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, who represents the Attorney-General, whether he is able to confirm that there are currently at least 10 cases before the High Court of Australia in which Commonwealth legislation or its administrative procedures  are  under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he able to confirm the report published today that the constitutionality of sections of the Trade Practices Act also are to be challenged before the High Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he obtain from the AttorneyGeneral information as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenges pending in the High Court and the stage which the challenges have reached, and place that information before the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also able to inform the Senate whether the Government acts in accordance with legal advice tendered to it as to the constitutionality of its measures before it adopts them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How then, and under what <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> warrant, has this Commonwealth Government assumed the title, ‘Australian Government’, and imposed a series of ancillary titles denying the correct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Commonwealth title and status in the Australian federation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I suggest that it is primarily a matter of preference and not a matter on which any great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now remind the House of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose ‘remind’ is the wrong word because most honourable members have never come into contact with this sort of thing in their time, and perhaps I should say that I shall explain the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say that in the haste of some honourable senators to ensnare their political opponents and their wives in a net of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> breach they demean the Senate and themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was that reading which convinced me in the final analysis of the need to accept the consensus which exists in the Senate and that this matter should be taken out of the area of disputation amongst honourable senators and sent into an area where the Senate could be informed by the Court  of Disputed  Returns, the High Court of Australia, whether there exists the case in which  Senator Webster  had- and I believe unwittinglybreached the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements of section 44 and section 45. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To abolish proceedings completely would be to deprive members of the public of the opportunity of taking action to enforce the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements of pecuniary interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme could bring with it <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems and certainly will bring industrial problems as the laws of the 2 States are so different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has not yet progressed to a stage of any formal recommendations and the States have not been receptive to the suggestion that local government bodies be represented on the Loan Council and the referendum to amend the Constitution has failed, chiefly I suppose, because its effect was misunderstood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think you meant that we resolved upon a course whereby a judicial committee should be set up to inquire into circumstances relating to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions for disqualification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the time for presentation of the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the clauses of the National Compensation Bill 1974 be extended till 30 June 1975; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of the clauses of the National Compensation Bill 1974 was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on 30 October 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Greenwood would be wise to listen because he is on very bad <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis of this grant is section 8 1 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it because the Attorney-General apprehends that if the High Court was able to pass judgment upon the way in which the scheme has been developing it would say that the scheme has been developed by the Commonwealth without <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not the only area of Commonwealth expenditure which is subject to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On what <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis are these grants made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Department and the Minister taken legal advice as to whether the Commonwealth is entitled to make these grants, or may it be said that they lack all <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not for that reason but for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons the State Government insurance offices are not covered by the Insurance Acts or the Life Insurance Act and no one so far, to the best of my knowledge, has claimed that this gives them an unfair advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function of Parliament constitutionally is to see that performance is carried out in accordance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a method of nibbling away at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice of the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the point is that the Government would be able to spend any part of this amount, which I have said is running at the rate of almost $600m, on any objective that the Government chooses, and it would not have to ask the Parliament for its approval or have parliamentary authority for it, nor would it have to have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first relates to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> justification which might have been offered for this legislation; the second is to consider whether laws of this character can be expected to have the overall beneficial effects which can be claimed for legislation which deals with racial discrimination; and the third is to specify a little more precisely why the Opposition will propose its type of enforcement in preference to that which the Government has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>States which had the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to enact laws in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently Professor Wootten as he then was, now  Mr Justice  Wootten, gave evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cast some doubts on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of some of the clauses of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government therefore fully supports the current moves by concerned African states towards a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conference between the African National Council and the Smith regime to achieve such a settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote again from the report of the Committee of 1954 which very thoughtfully expressed the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Treasury stated that it observed generally the traditional <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle of prior parliamentary approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would be seeking some further detail in this context so that we may proceed in more detail with the examination of the statement that has been provided; but I felt that as an introduction to this discussion today we should put into context the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle, which has been upheld, of prior parliamentary approval for expenditure by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedures which have been followed this year are no different from those which have been followed in the past, and I was glad to hear that principle corroborated by 2 members of the Opposition, one of whom was  Senator Guilfoyle,  who agreed when questioned in an interjection by  Senator McAuliffe  that the Government had not broken any legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions, although she said that it had broken the spirit of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that on 9 April 1968, when the then Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  delivered a paper titled ‘Political and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Problems in National Transport Planning’ for the Special Lectures in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would allow an expression of views from those people in the community who wish to express their interpretation of the legislation, from the people who have to work within the legislation and from the State governments which find great threats to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers which they wish to exercise in matters relating to transport within their own States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Federal Labor Government will promptly restore the machinery the Constitution intended and vest it with the Commonwealth ‘s full <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to plan and provide modern means of communications between the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was realised that in addition there should be created a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> body, partly administrative and partly judicial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly, perhaps, did the founding fathers look to the American institution, the Federal Inter-State Commission, which has operated with expanding authority in the Federation which was our parent so far as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure is concerned, namely, the United States of America from then to now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in our Constitution section 102 provided that there shall be an Inter-State Commission with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions and laws of trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I can recall it, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, representing the 3 major Parties in the Parliament at the time, unanimously recommended the reconstitution of this Inter-State Commission, first for the purpose that I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, secondly at that time we followed a terrific era of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> contention in the High Court when, for a long time, the view prevailed that transport legislation in some way escaped the prohibition of section 92 and that it was not required to provide free transport among the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles as a guide, one would find that only one of those cases in a thousand would ever need to go before the courts if one adopted an administrative approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that anyone who asserts that they are a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> exercise of power pursuant to section 10 1 of the Constitution or pursuant to any other head of power is simply using the vehicle of this Inter-State Commission to pursue a campaign against unions for party political propaganda purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to realise that in Australia we suffer from the grave disability that the central government, the Federal government- call it what you like- has completely inadequate economic powers, so much so that in December of 1973 it went to the people to obtain a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change to give it power with respect to incomes and prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also a matter of history that subsequent efforts to reconstitute the Commission failed, despite the recommendations of the royal commission of the late 1920s and the recommendations of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review of the late 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would assert to the Senate that it is perfectly clear that the InterState Commission was intended by the founders to be essential- I emphasise the word ‘essential’ to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> machinery and to the federal structure of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Commission has been, in practice and in effect, a dead body for some 60 years- since 1950 it has been completely legally dead- as the Joint Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which met from 1957 to 1959 reported that there should be an Inter-State Commission, and after all the references, including the report of the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum resources which some years ago contained a similar recommendation, surely the Opposition is able to crystallise its thinking by tonight or tomorrow as to what the powers of the Commission should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wriedt  wanted to bring before the Senate the record of Opposition senators who at times have expressed support for the Inter-State Commission and he sought to rely for support on the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959 which recommended the re-establishment of an InterState Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Bill designed to put into effect a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision and this puts it in a special category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to my mind no doubt that the members of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review have a right to be heard in this matter, and they have not been heard so far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that there are some grounds for the adoption of a Bill to implement the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Court of Australia had declared its most significant and purposeful function to be unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a royal commission in Western Australia in 1925, a royal commission in South Australia at about the same time, and a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee in 1928, all of which recommended the reconstitution of the Inter-State Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then in 1 958-59 we had the report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, which was a joint committee of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told by the Minister when he introduced this legislation that it was the Government’s intention at this time for the Inter-State Commission to operate under the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions by which it was empowered to be constituted, only in the field of transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Commission, because of the limited nature of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, will not go as far as that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Last night  Senator Wright  took some pride in saying that he and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitiam)  were the only 2 remaining members of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said that if we do this we shall disturb the present State organisations which are advisory bodies, and that there are changed circumstances today as between the time when the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee was established or the time when the Constitution was set down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should know that the general powers of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission rely upon the very special <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis provided for in section 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution, and he will also know that this is not a provision of the Constitution relating to trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will have every chance to argue the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my view that it is a pity that following the execution of that document legislation was not enacted at a State level, where there is less <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> uncertainty, to deal with the question of racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is at present a related question under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge in the High Court involving the legislation by the Australian Parliament providing for grants to the States for schools conducted by churches and other religious organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting, particularly in the light of the Bill introduced by the Government and which is before the Senate now, that in a similar measure the United States of America reserved the right not to implement sections of the Convention which, as the Americans put it, contradicted America’s own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision for the freedom of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should not have to refer to the sheer duplication and waste by the Commonwealth in covering areas of administration already constitutionally the prerogative of the States and the difficulties involved in working under arrangements such as have been outlined in the Bill with which we are dealing at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill should be more concisely drawn in relation to the way in which it will operate in order to ensure that the Commission operates only within the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The style of this Bill places some doubt in the minds of the State Government about its constitutionality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations, the general juristic limitations, on our power to deal with racial discrimination in this country will be considered by that Committee in considering as a result of complaints whether we have complied with the terms of the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister representing the Attorney-General inform the Senate when we can expect an announcement of the appointment of the judicial committee to inquire into breach of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> qualifications by members of Parliament which the Senate more than 5 weeks ago resolved would be established? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I bring up the report from the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development in the Northern Territory, together with the minutes of evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen, Senator Chaney, Senator Durack, Senator Everett, Senator Button  and I gave lengthy consideration to the clauses of this Bill in the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Bill was debated here I referred to the meetings of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs dealing with this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who is in favour of the Bill, 1 want to say that 1 am disturbed to know that our <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee comprised of legal men mostly, I understand, should come to the chamber today and admit that this particularly important aspect was not noticed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but those decisions, in my humble judgment, or rather- for it is in nearly all the instances only so- these expressions of opinion by the way, have signified not alone an encroachment upon and suppression of private right, but the gradual invasion and undermining of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To remit the maintenance of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to the region of judicial discretion is to shift the foundations of freedom from the rock to the sand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to show that I am not referring to considerations of antiquity and to remind the Committee of what Lord Shaw said about judges certainly not being permitted to invade this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right, I shall refer to what Lord Shaw said: He said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the high <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles involved here, I submit that this Committee ought not to trespass again upon the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right which is, as the House of Lords pertinently reminded us, the fundamental guarantee of freedom that judicial proceedings in some measure should be the subject of publicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say this to you,  Mr Temporary Chairman,  because you would know that I intend no offence at all: Unless you are to usurp my senatorial right of freedom to propose an amendment and to speak to it- I remind you that Lord Shaw said that the judges below had usurped an important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right- you surely will not rule that an amendment which does not introduce a single word but seeks the omission of words that the House of Representatives has used in its amendment is not relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that to nominate the Director of the Australian Legal Aid Office is to give legislative endorsement to an administrative creation of dubious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity which has no accepted position in any legislation which has been brought before this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I sit down I would also like to pay a tribute to the work of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which, in its deliberations helped to make this a better Bill than it was when it was introduced into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Minister that the members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs greatly appreciate the fine work which he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the disturbances that resulted in the shooting apparently were touched off by disagreement between rival nationalist groups, the illegal Smith regime by its intransigence and attitudes towards <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> negotiations which should lead to majority rule must bear a primary responsibility for creating the situation underlying the tragedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review recommended this particular reform in 1958 and again in 1959- with only one member dissenting- there had been only 3 occasions on which an election had been held to elect members of one House only- those for the House of Representatives in 1929 and 1954 and that for the Senate in 1 953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say is that on the occasion when the junta in Chile took over and at the occasion of the swearing-in ceremony of the new government, the military leaders pledged to return the country to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rule as soon as circumstances permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the ultimate return to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rule will be delayed if clandestine, subversive movements are seeking to overthrow the existing government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government of  President  Allende backs military and guerrilla groups and arms them with a view to establishing the authority of a government which is acting unconstitutionally, there is bound to be a reaction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been carefully overlooked, with the lawyer’s skill of  Senator James  McClelland, is that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision- by word, by clause, by specification- in the Republic of Chile making the armed forces responsible for the preservation of the Chilean Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claims to be a lawyer, but he did not understand even the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions of that Republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to remind honourable senators, if it is possible to get under the veneer of their sterile anti-communism, that the Socialist International is an organisation of social democratic parties whose objective is to bring about social change through <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not mean, however, that we condone their seizure of power, nor does it mean that we will not be related to those elements that seek to have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rearrangement in Chile in order that that country can proceed along the path of emancipation for its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no accident that the Christian Democratic Party, which one could generally describe as being of a conservative nature, having its counterparts in the governments of Italy and many other parts of Europe, has now officially dissociated itself from the military junta and has called for the return of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an example, I can mention  Mrs Bachelet  whose husband was a general in the Chilean air force, who was regarded in Chile as being a constitutionalist, and who pledged himself to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was in charge of food supplies and as a result of his adherence to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practices of the Chilean Government, led by the late  President  Allende, he was put in gaol and suffered violence, torture and subsequently death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the disadvantage of those of us who want to see social change brought about by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means that people like  Senator Greenwood  try to suggest that the forces for social change by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and democratic means are acting against the best interests of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it wrong for the  President  who holds the political and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to have arms within the Presidential Palace when it was common knowledge within the country that there were members of the armed forces who were seeking to overthrow the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had reached a position in England about a century ago when Maitland, the famous legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> historian, was able to write in 1888: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right rests with the State governments, not with the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly outside the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Federal Government to take any action of that nature unless there was some agreed quota arrangement with the State concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parliament has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for State courts and cannot, under the Constitution, intervene in the organisation of these courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the time for presentation of the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the clauses of the National Compensation Bill 1974 be extended until 2 1 July 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is likewise of the view that the advantages suggested by the Government for the Superior Court are far outweighed by other serious practical and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 systems would be explicable only by an expert in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest single disadvantage of the proposed Superior Court is that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions of jurisdiction will necessarily loom large in the Court’s deliberations, resulting in considerable uncertainty and expense to litigants, unproductive use of the Court’s time, and consequent damage to the quality of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us not get too carried away by the proposition put by such distinguished <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers as  Senator Sheil  that this Bill is in some way a retrograde step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 1 August 1974 the House of Representatives affirmed the decision taken by that House on 31 May 1973 that the Australian Parliament join with the parliaments of the States in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention that has been established to review the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  together with the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  and the Honourable Ian Sinclair, attended a meeting of the executive committee of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention that had been called to consider an agenda for the next full meeting of the Convention and to establish a date and place for the holding of that meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is to include a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment for the interchange of powers between the Australian and State parliaments- a much needed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment; consideration of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of local government; several important references of power to the Australian Parliament, and a number of matters of importance to the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must look at the whole history of this <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known- nobody is under any illusion- that the Prime Minister would not care if the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention died and disappeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Prime Minister would be able to say to the Premiers Conference next week: ‘I wanted to go to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention but those old dinosaurs in the Senate who are supposed to represent the States prevented the national Parliament from being represented ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, I thought this was supposed to be a parliamentary delegation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  is now looking to use brute force in this House to alter the position dramatically in his Party’s favour, in fact to double- to put up by 100 per cent- the representation of his Party from this Senate at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Withers’  view prevails there will be a significant independent and small party viewpoint which will be unrepresented at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So as far as the Federal Parliament is concerned the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention will be a big party machine deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope they have not made any changes in South Australia because my colleague and State leader,  Mr Robin  Millhouse, is recognised as a very keen and able <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> student and lawyer who applies himself well to matters relating to the Federal Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without in any way arguing this in a personal way, I think it is wrong for  Senator Withers  to try to use brute force to double his party’s involvement from the Senate at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and to exclude all federal non-major party representation at that Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in replyThe proposition which is now before the Senate on behalf of the Government is simply to ensure that what can be fairly described as a new political party, namely, the Liberal Movement, should be represented at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has not been greatly interested in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, but it is interesting to note that only this week he attended the meeting of the Executive Committee of that Convention which I think was held in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is quite clear that the exercise of powers under this Bill raises and will raise a vast number of very difficult questions not only of Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law but also of international law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic charge that we make against the Government is that it is the Prime Minister who has ignored <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are to some extent involved, as my colleague  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack mentioned earlier, in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr Justice  Murphy, as Attorney-General, also promise at the Standing Committee’s meeting on 3 July 1 973 to let the States have an outline of the type and scope of the powers which he felt would be necessary to enable the Commonwealth to legislate in a competent manner removed from any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have just said reflects a time-honoured <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle of the greatest importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point of my mentioning this is but to indicate that I stand in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship to the Crown in which under the Constitution the Executive power of the Commonwealth alone is vested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a well recognised <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle that the deliberations of the Crown are secret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of its Law Officers, I may not consistently with my <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty intentionally act in opposition to its claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, 1 shall attend the Senate in  answer to the summons issued by it as one of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> organs of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750715_senate_29_s64/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are engaged in an exercise of high <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> import. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against my own Party I voted for the production of Government files, which was the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It puts down quite properly in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, legal and parliamentary sense the way in which the Senate ought to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Byers; It is because the Crown has made the claim in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Byers; I should have thought that there were the most central principles of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me, as I think  Senator Greenwood  said earlier today, that this raises a central <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point, and the point is: May I in conscience answer a question which, in conscience, I believe I should not merely because one of the chambers of the legislature says that in its view the Crown ‘s claim to privilege is unfounded? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am endeavouring to do, to the best of my ability, is to act consistently with my <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty to the Crown in not revealing its confidences whatever the result may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Greenwood,  if I may say so with respect, raised it quite clearly this morning when he said that this was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is not the ground which you disclosed to the  President  in your letter of 15 July based upon the ‘well recognised <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle that the deliberations of the Crown are secret’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one of its Law Officers, I may not consistently with my <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty intentionally act in opposition to its claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Byers; Again with respect, I do not understand those as but specific examples of the central <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> notion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The central <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> notion is the secrecy of the deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the central <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> notion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just  speaking intellectually, my approach is rather to ask: What is the central <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> notion which finds specific illustrations in various circumstances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have thought that the central <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> notion is the notion of secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2 occasions that voice from the past has spoken in vain- a voice of essential principle and genuine liberalism on these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues- both in 1974 and again in relation to the question now before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of that essential grandeur, that voice of true democratic liberalism and the view of a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, we get the sort of remarks which were made by  Senator Greenwood  in this chamber and on television about conspiracies, criminality and all the things of that kind which exist in the mind of that senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The desirability and feasibility of establishing a securities and exchange commission by the Commonwealth either alone or in co-operation with the States and the powers and functions necessary for such a commission to enable it to act speedily and efficiently against manipulation of prices, insider trading and such other improper or injurious practices as the Committee finds have occurred or may occur in relation to shares and other securities of public companies, and to recommend generally in regard to the foregoing such legislative and administrative measures by the Commonwealth as will, having regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> division of legislative power in Australia, enable the utmost protection of members of the public and the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution itself provides by section 74 that no appeal shall be permitted to the Privy Council from a decision of the High Court upon any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits  inter se  of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States or as to the limits  inter se  of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of any two or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is one which ought to be determined by the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are threatened with the possibility of what is called a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis is when the Lords threaten the use of legal powers bestowed on them by the legislation which ultimately trimmed their wings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply state facts and for particularity I refer to a lot of the evidence that was given publicly to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in relation to the National Compensation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those figures would be very much in line with the figures recently given publicly to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to which I referred earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is rather an amusing side to a serious subject because the legal advice given to me is that for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons the powers of the Tribunal in this respect are limited to companies and cannot be directed to individual people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal’s jurisdiction extends only to companies, for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons, and its powers are limited to this type of business organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that when it was proposed to bring in an Australian law to cover drugs, under the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Australian Government in relation to international agreements, it was the States, including Queensland, which opposed the Australian Government having that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> barrier, as we found with the Trade Practices Act, to the completely comprehensive application of the provisions of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We got far more effective legislation because of the fact that the Family Law Bill was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember that early in its life this Government attempted to implement a prices and incomes policy and it sought additional <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base for this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 9 I have asked quite seriously whether there is a proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base for this form of activity which, it is freely admitted, was engaged in by governments of our political persuasion as well as by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs established that the Bill was rotten to the core and basically was wrongly established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it said that the whole question of command was in complete doubt, that there was a grave <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question involved, and that it needed to be clarified, perhaps even to the point of a referendum, before the question of command in Australia could be put beyond doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Now, those who read this report, as no doubt  Senator Poyser  has, will know that it was concluded from the evidence that it is quite impossible in the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> circumstances for the Governor-General to vest his authority in anyone else at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention debates in Melbourne in 1 898 an amendment was proposed that command in chief should only be exercised on the advice of the Executive Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee recommends that the Government establish an eminent group of people to study the complex legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues which are raised in the above paragraph. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposed new section 8 defines the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Minister and provides that, as always has been the case, the authority exercised by the senior Service Chiefs will be subject to the directions of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The commandinchief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is, in accordance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> usage, vested in the Governor-General as the Queen’s Representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is one of the oldest and most honoured prerogatives of the Crown, but it is now exercised in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is there a proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base for this proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement of Parliamentary authority for the expenditure of the moneys borrowed would be satisfied by clause 4 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As soon as I am in receipt of the name of this nominee,I shall advise you accordingly and, at the same time, the necessary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedures for the filling of this casual senate vacancy brought about by Dame Annabelle ‘s resignation will be set in train. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that resolution expressed a recognition of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My remarks were not based upon the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation but upon information from Jewish sources about the relative degree of freedom from persecution afforded by the authorities in the three Baltic States in that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the third resolution, in 1970, was that questions relating to changes in the Papua New Guinea Act or changes in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of Papua New Guinea were for the members of the House of Assembly to determine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Leader of the Government should acknowledge this and should at least inform this Senate, which has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in respect of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, what is involved in what appears now to be an open ended Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will arise inevitably because no country can develop without problems in such a short space of time from a comparatively primitive society in the parliamentary and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no precedent that I can refer to for a situation such as this, and it is obvious that I could not give a decision on such an important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Press of this country talks about whether the Senate has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power or authority to pass a Budget- poor little scribblers who take their information from yesterday’s newspaper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Budget is not a proper occasion to get the Government to the country, for my part- the Senate having the inalienable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority and therefore the responsibility to reject every Bill that we think is contrary to proper responsibility- the Government should go to the country, and the sooner the better, not for us but for the relief of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Australian Government uses its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Australian Government uses its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to assist the Queensland Government and any other properly constituted body to develop and conserve the recreational, educational and scientific potentials of the natural environment of Fraser Island for the long term benefit of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know that the Australian Government would have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to exercise any control over such an activity except possibly through the Prices Justification Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We also face the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem of whether the Commonwealth has the right to establish an inquiry into the behaviour of State police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By his statement the Minister has signified that the Government recognises- I think this is very important- that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are sovereign territories of the Australian people and are a sovereign part of the Australian mainland in exactly the same way, I suggest- whatever is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difference between Queensland and the Australian Government- as islands in the Torres Strait are an integral part of the Australian mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He comes here laying down propositions on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and parliamentary practice with the air, urgency and assertion that we should take notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority is there, other than yesterday’s newspapers or the newspapers that repeat themselves and grow within themselves, as does  Senator Hall,  on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters, for an idea that a parliament elected by the people is entitled to run its term? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that  Senator Hall,  if he were to remind himself calmly and simply that there has been <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice in this country even within his memory and a little before his short experience beganbut no doubt he has had the opportunity to acquaint himself with it- would know that Prime Ministers have regarded themselves as entitled to advise the Crown to dissolve a parliament of which they may have a control by majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was about to say when I was interrupted that apparently the new expert would give the right to a fragment of a party in the lower House, by withdrawing 4 or 5 votes to a junta or a party, to cross the benches today and to establish a new party and so constitutionally cause the Government to go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that a fragmentation of the government party in the lower House is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> justification for destroying a government but that this House is denied the right to reject any measure such as I have described. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can take the challenge to go to the country and has been given the opportunity by the Senate to do so a dozen times by proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rise only because I am tired and impatient at the ignorance that is paraded uncontradicted too often that this House has not the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to reject any Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am just testing the absolute flimsiness and putting into perspective the inalienable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In CANBERRA today, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Lynch,  charged the Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  with trying to ‘create circumstances for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> anarchy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, during the past several weeks, as a matter of electoral panic has mounted a campaign in which it has attempted to deride and criticise the Opposition for not staying within what the Government is pleased to call the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions and practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those professors talk about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it wants to stay totally with the law it cannot attempt to criticise the Senate for exercising its undoubted legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to force an election for the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one reads the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> debates of the 1890s, section 57 was inserted for quite a simple reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what a government did not do was just insist upon its legalistic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and build up a storehouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no law compelling the Government to do such a thing, and the Government is quite within its legal rights and its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights not to proceed under the Electoral Act and resubmit the matters to the Electoral <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would do no harm at this stage to indicate that one of the very first questions which was raised by  Senator Cotton  was: ‘Is there a proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base for this proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement of Parliamentary authority for the expenditure of the moneys borrowed would be satisfied by clause 4 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the matters to which  Mr Hamer  and the Leader of the National Country Party in Victoria have referred are matters which are the subject of the Woodhouse-Meares report, they were dealt with by the National Compensation Bill which is still on the notice paper in the Senate and was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier, when the United States of America was involved in ethnic problems with the vast waves of migrants entering the United States of America, it made it quite clear that when a migrant came to the United States of America, applied for citizenship and was granted that citizenship by swearing to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, he had fulfilled the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements of the United States of America to become an American citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that many years ago- in 1922, as a matter of fact- 2 justices of the High Court, Chief Justice Knox and  Mr Justice  Starke, sat to determine the constitutionality issue in the actual case in which they had previously appeared as counsel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the famous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> case of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice Marshall presided over the United States Supreme Court and ruled on the validity of events in which he had participated as Secretary of State <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absurd to suggest that Justice Murphy should not rule on whether, apart from the method of its passing, the Act was <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect, the case was no different from the one concerning the constitutionality of any one of the hundreds of Acts which were passed during the period of each of the former advisers to the government who now sit on the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it ought to be recalled, in the light of what he said, that  Mr Justice  Murphy had declined to sit upon the first <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> case which the High Court heard after his appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is usual for the Bench on hearing a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> case to be composed of all Justices available to participate in the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That initial attitude which was expressed by  Mr Justice  Murphy was not carried through to subsequent cases of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> import on which he has sat, one alone of which has so far reached the point of judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s reference to  Sir Adrian  Knox and  Mr Justice  Starke I think completely misrepresents the actual statement which those judges made in which they explained why, having regard to a provision that there should be at least 3 justices concurring in any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> case, they had to sit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But during its discussion before the Full Court, some questions affecting the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth arose, and it was doubtful if a decision of the case could be arrived at unless those questions were determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>provide: ‘A Full Court consisting of less than all the Justices shall not give a decision on a question affecting the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth, unless at least three Justices concur in the decision’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The significant aspect of that passage is that the 2 judges involved did not consider that to participate in a debate on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspect of the matter was in any way in breach of their duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-But they adjudicated on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects, which is exactly what  Mr Justice  Murphy has been doing in this case, and I think that the tortuous casuistic attempts which  Senator Greenwood  has made to justify his original totally unjustified slur of  Mr Justice  Murphy simply will not hold water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> body that is not beholden to either the Commonwealth Government or the State Government and is therefore the only body in the Constitution of an executive nature that has a power to override divisions between a State and the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was part of a continuing campaign being conducted by the Opposition and master-minded by the present Leader of the Opposition to scratch around with their fingernails in an attempt to find what he calls reprehensible circumstances’ to justify rejecting the Appropriation Bills and plunging this country into a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I dare say that neither the facts, the rules of arithmetic, nor the parliamentary conventions which have governed Australia or which have regulated the political system in Australia for the last 70 years will deter the Opposition from circulating untrue statements, from attempting to establish what they call the reprehensible grounds which they are searching desperately to find to plunge this country into a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen a copy of the letter which  Sir Robert  Menzies sent to  Sir Philip  Game in 1 932 commenting on the circumstances in which the late  Mr Lang  was dismissed from office and giving  Sir Robert’s  opinion on certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters which are again being aired today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the substance of the letter and does it illuminate current <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following the dismissal of  Mr Lang  in 1932, various interested parties including <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers wrote letters to  Sir Philip  Game. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, the newspaper demand that you should dismiss a Premier on the ground that there was some reason for believing that he no longer enjoyed the confidence of the electors always seemed to me to be based upon an absolute misconception of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of a modern Governor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election, and upon his continued authority in the popularly elected House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia today faces a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those on the other side of the chamber who say ‘hear, hear’ show to the Australian people the horrible alternative that faces them in the event of the Opposition bringing about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis which it is seeking to bring about in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was willing to distort the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes in order to obtain money by getting an oral opinion from the then Attorney-General at an Executive Council meeting at which I believe neither the Governor-General nor the Vice-President of the Executive Council were present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How could any Opposition, having undergone the traumatic experience of seeing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes distorted for one reason or another, approach the problem of the defence Loan Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are merely adopting the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> method of giving the people a choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam made clear his understanding of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no tradition, as has been suggested, that the Senate will not use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers whenever it considers it necessary or desirable to do so in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers except the limits self-imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Malcolm Fraser, the Leader of the Opposition, in explaining his accusation against  Mr Whitlam,  said that the matter was an illegal conspiracy, and he produced the professional opinion of  Mr William  Deane, Q.C., a leading <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer of the Sydney Bar, which said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gentleman, who will try to cling to office despite the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge that the Senate makes to him to go to the people, came to light this morning and equipped himself with the letter of  Mr R.  G. Menzies written 40 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only has a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis arisen, but the decision plays into the hands of subversive elements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, is this yet another example of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice being flouted in the interests of the political advantage of one political Party which has twice been rejected by the electors of Australia within less than 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Government which can send a pathetic puppet like  Senator Field  to Canberra in defiance of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and tradition could be expected to have a Governor with no regard for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Bill, these terms are given the same meaning as in the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, and the provisions of the Bill relating to the off-shore industry are therefore placed on the same <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis as the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>deplore in the strongest terms the intended action of the Senate to reject or delay Supply stop We believe Constitution empowers the House of Representatives and only the House of Representatives the right to make or bring down governments stop We urge you not to be a party to any action that would precipitate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> chaos and prejudice future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in Australia stop <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No government can continue under our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system without Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Library gave me Howard’s  Australian Federal <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On page 6 of that volume we find reference to the difference between the interpretation of common law and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most interesting and important characteristic of Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law is the continuing tension it displays between common law and federal attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, as applied to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions the theory of impartial legalism can be argued to nave the serious defect of being an abdication rather than an assumption of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that we are in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis, it is one which the Prime Minister is making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, legitimate course open for this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it chooses, although senators will not take their seats in the Senate until next July, it is constitutionally empowered to have an election for half the Senate at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was what  Mr Fraser  has always said and those who know him know that it is a view which he holds fervently as a sound and important principle of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, a principle which he declared as one on which he places very great weight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment like the Parliament Act is enacted in some form in Australia the English analogy just is not applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it has happened in Chile which, despite some of the humorous remarks that have been made about that country by people sitting opposite, is not a banana republic but a country with a long <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democratic history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to take <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means to avoid the breakdown in government which may happen if he finds himself still in office at the end of November without Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder how <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> it is that these 3 bureaucrats should have the power to fix prices when government price fixing is not included in the Constitution and was rejected at the last referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The House of Representatives claims that what the Senate did is not contemplated within the terms of the Constitution and was contrary to established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not look at any one person in particular, because I believe that there are persons on Bills- I Opposition benches who are capable of acquiring principles for the purpose of assisting the nation to be extricated from this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis into which it has been plunged by the blatant and premature grab for power by power-hungry members of the National Country Party- I put them first,  Senator Webster-  and the Liberals in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore difficult to predict with certainty which payments could be delayed and those that could cease almost immediately because of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> crisis and political impasse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I can only say I hope that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> crisis in Canberra will not be allowed to become the threat it could pose to the stability of State government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to that which has been advanced by  Senator Everett  through the document that we gave him leave to incorporate in  Hansard,  it betrays on the part of the Premier of Tasmania a complete misunderstanding of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes that should govern the methods and procedures of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be those on the other side- the Cavanaghs- who would prevent my delivering the response here now because of this pusillanimous, contemptible channelling by  Senator Everett  into the records of this chamber to cow the senators of Tasmania to a complete acceptance of the unconstitutional arrogance - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the Australian Government uses its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have not seen the report in the  Australian Financial Review,  but since the Senate Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs brought down its report on the previous National Compensation Bill discussions have been going on constantly within the Cabinet and within the Parliamentary Labor Party on the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>2) 1975-76 for the reasons given in the Senate resolution is not contemplated within the terms of the Constitution and is contrary to established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention, and therefore requests the Senate to re-consider and pass the Bills without delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That there is no convention and never has been any convention that the Senate shall not exercise its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate affirms that it has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to act as it did and now that there is a disagreement between the Houses of the Parliament and a position may arise where the normal operations of Government cannot continue, a remedy is presently available to the Government under section 57 of the Constitution to resolve the deadlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is currently trying to establish an atmosphere of great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis because of the deadlock between the 2 Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has adopted the proper democratic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> form which will allow this to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When previous governments were deadlocked the situation was resolved properly and constitutionally by a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all  Mr Whitlam  ‘s bluff and humbug, the plain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fact is that the Prime Minister no longer controls the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> machinery- a double dissolution- is the only way of resolving the deadlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this deadlock must be resolved in the proper legal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> manner- the holding of a general election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to raise some 5 claims that are being peddled around the community and being misunderstood by the community I want to examine those claims, because we recognise that this is a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue and the people of Australia deserve a full understanding of those 5 points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The first assertion- it is a wrong one, because each of the 5 claims is wrong- is that a government elected to office constitutionally should be permitted to remain in office for the whole of its term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those who as lawyers look to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters should go back to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> debates and they will understand that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fathers deliberately pondered upon upper houses overseas and their limited powers and constructed an upper House here with powers specifically given to it, including this power which is now being used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has been referred to as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a situation which, in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms, has already been foreseen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a clear duty on the Prime Minister not to create a crisis but to use the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process and to advise the Governor-General that the Prime Minister no longer can govern this country and that he must take his Government to the people for their verdict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for all these reasons that having had many messages from people whom I respect and who are concerned at this time- and I have had many more messages from people who are obviously supporters of the Government in relation to dealing with this situation- I insist, as an elected senator for Australia, that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions to deal with the deadlock between the 2 Houses of Parliament should immediately be put into operation by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not about political convention or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have heard the phrase used many times that this democratic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> activity that we are involved in at the moment is a political innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few weeks there have been some views- I must admit that these views are still relatively few- emanating mainly from academic cocoons and other ivory towers to the effect that the Senate Opposition in the Parliament of this country is acting in a manner which is anti-<span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and which is not related to the conventions under which we operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no tradition, as has been suggested, that the Senate will not use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, whenever it considers it necessary or desirable to do so, in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the performance of the Government that is causing instability in this country and it is the performance of the Government of which the Senate Opposition must take heed today and on which it must act in a responsible manner within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of review that so rightly and properly rest with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators on the other side of the chamber are serious in not wishing to see fear and confusion reign supreme in this country they will do that which is honourable and that which is required according to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis arises from the Prime Minister’s determination to follow the lead of  Mrs Ghandi  in India- a country which had a Constitution to protect it from absolute power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election, and upon his continued authority in the popularly elected House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition senators, particularly elderly Opposition senators who have some sense of history, do not want it to be indelibly recorded in  Hansard  that they personally voted to reject Appropriation Bills for the first time in 75 years of Federation, thereby jeopardising or endangering the survival of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since  Senator Rae  or someone else has mentioned the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions I suggest that he look at the record of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions of the 1890s and see where Deakin realised right from the beginning- in fact from before the beginning- that the Senate would operate as a party House and not as a States House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion that was moved and passed in the House of Representatives yesterday expressed the sentiment that the reasons given in the Senate resolution- that was our resolution of last week- first, were not contemplated within the terms of the Constitution and, second, were contrary to established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He, the Labor Party Leader in the Senate, rejected the argument that the Senate did not have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and said quite clearly that it is a matter ‘of political judgment at the time that the decision is taken’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, of course, this great debate is really not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one because it was conceded long ago, and it was conceded specifically today in the Senate by the Leader of the Government in the Senate that the real debate is on a political situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate affirms that it has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to act as it did and now that there is a disagreement between the Houses of the Parliament and a position may arise where the normal operations of Government cannot continue, a remedy is presently available to the Government under section 57 of the Constitution to resolve the deadlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to quote now from a statement by the Right Honourable  Sir Robert  Menzies, who is a man for whom I have the greatest admiration, who is one of the greatest statesmen we have ever known in Australia and who is today one of the most competent gentlemen in the field of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, it has been suggested on the one hand that the Governor-General may be the centre of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> storm involving an Appropriation Bill which could be presented to him without passage through the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that in the event of a continuing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and financial crisis, caused by the Senate refusing supply, action will be taken to reduce excesses of” this” nature by the Leader of the Opposition who is known to be financially well endowed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Prime Minister in 1974, at just a threat from the Senate to stop supply, rush to a double dissolution election, yet under almost identical circumstances this time, with the actual delaying of Supply, the Prime Minister finds the excuse of a very great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question to prevent his going to an election on this occasion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a great deal of apprehension throughout the land at the continued attitude of the Opposition parties, attitudes which indicate clearly that they are endeavouring to create not only a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis, a political crisis, but also a financial crisis from which the Australian community may well suffer considerably more damage than from the indecision that has characterised the attitude of the Opposition since the Labor Government came into power in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are those who work endlessly to break down the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> mechanism of change by bypassing it, by advocating courses without the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very interesting to note that at this very moment in England the Conservatives, or the peers as they are called, in the British House of Lords are considering whether to force a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis in respect of government legislation- not Supply Bills, because the House of Lords has surrendered that right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem of preventing the Senate from inhibiting and frustrating government can be solved by  <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>  amendment, firstly, to deprive the Senate of the power to reject Supply for if it is to defeat a government it should do so on specific measures, not on general grounds of dislike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sir Isaac  Isaacs and other eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers have constantly placed before the Australian people the need to see the Senate as a House of review and not as a House bent to bring down the elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the complete opposite of our <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> provision, which- in section 64- lays it down that ‘ no minister of state shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless he is or becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strict Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> position is that, except as to ‘money Bills,’ that is those which impose or reduce taxes or appropriate moneys, the Senate has equal power with that of the House of Representatives, in respect of all proposed laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What seemed to be regarded by most people at the time as a fairly normal matter may turn out to be a quite remarkable and crucial event in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the legal power of the Senate to refuse Supply, and the absence of any convention that it shall not do so, are quite clear from the debates of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister and his party and trade union followers have decided however to defy convention and to tough it out’ (as they put it) with the avowed intention of smashing the power of the Senate forever, thus destroying the Federal compact, centralising all power in Canberra and effectively robbing us of one of the chiefest safeguards of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As any lawyer will tell the honourable senator,  Mr Gruzman  is noted more as counsel for the financial desperado Alexander Barton than for any performance in the field of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He took it upon himself to issue gratuitous advice to the Governor-General which was out of tune with anything I have read from any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer and which does not stand up to examination in the light of the sections of the Constitution which he was attempting to construe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis; it is a political crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this matter I have considered the writing of  Sir Richard  Eggleston, whom I regard as something of an authority in certain areas of law, although certainly not on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We say to the people that our action has been <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there is no convention and never has been any convention that the Senate shall not exercise its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Senate affirms that it has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to act as it did and now that there is a disagreement between the Houses of the Parliament and a position may arise where the normal operations of government cannot continue, a remedy is presently available to the Government under section 57 of the Constitution to resolve the deadlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reliance on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to reject Supply misses the point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The continuation of democracy requires political parties to do more than exact their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> pound of flesh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is well to remember that most of what was done by Hitler was done within <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is, and has been, much said and much written concerning a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow me to raise my voice alongside that of my Leader, Malcolm Fraser, when I state categorically that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us have done with that humbug and hypocrisy that we are having a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis at the moment; we are not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us have no more of this humbug and mischief that is going on at the moment about a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I say in conclusion is that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot stress that enough, and I want the people of Australia to know that we are not facing a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis or a political crisis is little to the point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis; it is a crisis that has been brought about because this Government will not face up to its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister was challenged in the House of Representatives on the attitude he would take towards the Senate in the context of the Appropriation Bills, he put down that tremendous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal advice that it was the duty of the Government to resign, but when questioned again on the same matter the other week in the other place it was found that he had changed his mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually that culminated in an attempt by the Senate to bring before the Bar of the Senate some public servants in order to throw some light, through them, upon this murky <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process that had taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not in a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis in the sense that has been advocated and argued by Government senators or by Government supporters in another place, but we are in a crisis where the authority of the Parliament is being directly challenged by the Prime Minister who refuses to disclose to the Australian people the elements of corruption which involve him or some of his Ministers, whom he has acknowledged were involved in it in the last 12 months- since December 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been activated and motivated at the present time is the Senate which, for the first time in 75 years, has had to reach for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power that is given to it to deal with matters of the high and scandalous nature with which we are involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jealous guardianship of unwritten <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions, based on precedent, is the firmest guarantee of liberty and order in any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That condition came about on 2 December 1 972 when the new criterion of reprehensible circumstances had not been invented in Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real task is to persuade the Australian people of that as a political exercise, quite apart from the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which you have, quite apart from questions of political morality and quite apart from departure from the fine sounding statements which their new Leader of principle has espoused over the last few months and from which he has so consistently departed in practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems certain that future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements will be discussed also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is firmly of the view that this very necessary need can only be achieved effectively if all its  aspects  are brought together under one authority which has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to set and enforce these standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have been able to obviate the money problems that it has at the moment or the one that it will have from 30 November until next April and so obviate the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation and stay in government at all costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has established quite clearly that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> argument at all about this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there has been one surprise in this whole affair it has been that ordinary people have understood this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis- no matter how much the Opposition tells us it is not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis, it is- and have taken the matter to heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leading <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers in Australia have come out and said that the conventions that go with the Constitution should be observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the traditional <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice in order to bring about an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government believes, as the honourable senator has said, that nobody is against the Whitlam Government- she went on and on about this - let the Government take its courage in its hands, as is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, and go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trying now in the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> confrontation to put itself above the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only people who are breaking the Constitution at this moment are those who are breaking the clear <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice that when Supply cannot be established a government resigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask through you,  Mr Deputy  President: Is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call as witness the Prime Minister of Australia and the documents relating to the double dissolution which were tabled in the Senate yesterday Honourable senators will find by persuasive reading that it is said repeatedly that because the Senate has declined to grant Supply the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice is that the Prime Minister must go to the Governor-General and seek a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is on written record, by letters to the GovernorGeneral, saying that it is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty of a government denied Supply to go to the Governor-General and get an election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me move on to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of lawyers, academics and ordinary members of the public have expressed their views on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legality and/or propriety of what the Opposition is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view that I want to put to the Senate- it is a view that I expressed publicly in Queensland recently- is that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric which clothes Australian society does not consist solely of the written Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It consists also of the body of rules, precedents and practices which have been built up over a period of three-quarters of a century and which, in line with the development of the constitutions of other countries where those constitutions are not written, comprise just as important a part of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric as does the written Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is only half of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position that has to be met by an Opposition which will be judged in history as to whether it is acting with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that view is correct, then there can be no doubt whatsoever that the Opposition is behaving unconstitutionally in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say ‘illegally’ in the sense that court action could be taken against the Opposition or that in some way a judgment of a court could be obtained to the effect that what it is doing is constitutionally illegal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if 50 per cent of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric is the written Constitution and the other 50 per cent is that body of rules, practice and conventions that I assert it is, then the Opposition, on its own stance, stands convicted of having acted unconstitutionally in this matter and of persisting in acting unconstitutionally in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter to which I wish to refer is the assertion that was made by  Senator Rae  last week and repeated, although without detailed argument, by  Senator Carrick  this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, when one looks at the message which was sent to the House of Representatives by the Senate and which is referred to in the amendment moved by the Opposition yesterday, one finds that the whole area of the powers of the Senate, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue and so on are canvassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for words of abuse to be hurled at Opposition senators who are carrying out their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have sat in the middle of what has been described as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reject the concept of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we are simply acting out the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes under our Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that crisis is not <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They say that this is an undemocratic House which is not properly representative and it ought, therefore, to be frightened of carrying out the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities vested in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States Senate has great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, as does this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The specific <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision in Australia is that we have 2 chambers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there are differences of opinions among quite senior and distinguished lawyers as to the precise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote from what  Sir Norman  Cowper said in the  Sydney Morning Herald  yesterday because I think it represents the most dispassionate assessment of the so-called <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis I have seen over the past fortnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  judgment is slightly different from mine but as an analysis of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position I think it is the clearest and least argumentative that I have seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this has been said before but is it not the final proof that this argument is about politics, and to dress it up in whole lot of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> finery is simply a clever and so far fairly successful attempt to divert attention from the real political arguments on to a specious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other Committee that received the lash of the Prime Minister’s tongue was the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on which I served under 2 consecutive Labor Chairmen-  Senator James  McClelland and subsequently  Senator Everett. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J hope that Government senators will not join in the witch hunt against the Senate that has been indulged in by the Prime Minister and that they will not try to use the exercising of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of this chamber as a smokescreen to divert the debate from the real questions of politics that are affecting Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we are doing no more than our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty as senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has denied that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis exists, and he has endeavoured to draw upon the experiences of previous Oppositions and governments in the post-war years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he must accept that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis with us; there is a polarisation between the 2 Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are arguing that the Senate does not have the traditional or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to take the course of action which it has taken on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will win the minds and the support of the Australian people in this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>-cum-political crisis which has been engineered by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> understanding, realised that the parliamentary system has to work and, as it was impossible for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to work with the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, introduced a new intermediary into the procedures of the Senate, namely the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without provision for executive authority this was a very limited <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major parties in government and opposition have espoused the cause of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development for the Northern Territory in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator knows, the Government is now in the process of preparing a new National Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill to deal with the proposals for a national compensation scheme which will take into account most if not all of the recommendations which were made by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government can govern without the Budget being passed by the Parliament, what is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis about which the Prime Minister keeps talking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis is quite obvious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can the Minister say, as he did in answer to a question asked by  Senator Chaney  this morning, that the Opposition’s action in this chamber, in relation to the current appropriation Bills, is unprecendented and constitutes a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the matter of the powers of the Senate to reject money Bills and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety of the Senate’s present action has been dealt with  ad nauseam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a government, as in this case, exceeds its powers and its authority then these powers of the Senate are and were meant by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fathers to be a safeguard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads the reports of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention one sees that 20 per cent or so of the time of the proceedings of the convention was taken up with a discussion of the powers of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister and  Senator Gietzelt  talk of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and of tradition, it is important to remember that the Prime Minister is recorded as having said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator James  McClelland, in his attitude of righteous indignation the other day, quoted some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the views of the former  Senator Murphy,  whose standards of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law are so high that the Prime Minister saw fit to elevate him to the High Court, were made quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What utter nonsense it is for the Government and  Senator Gietzelt  to talk about breaking the Constitution when the High Court- the highest <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority in the land- has upheld the Senate’s powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not need to refer to other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities such as Professor Lane and others who have upheld the powers of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have listened to a variety of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and politicians on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not quite certain whether there is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power for the Senate to reject a money Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition senators that there is such <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power; that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis as such, that it is a political crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and some of our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> experts opposite could put their minds to this proposition: If it is not possible for the Senate to amend money Bills, if it is not possible for the Senate to amend 99 per cent of a money Bill and to leave one per cent unamended- I take it that that is not possiblethen surely it must be accepted that it is not possible to reject the Bill in toto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Parliament should be able to ask whether a matter is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> before the legislation is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to deny Supply, as I said before, having listened to all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and having become aware of their divisions and variety of opinions, 1 am not certain of this power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly four of the judges said that we have the total and absolute <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do what we are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Will the Leader of the Government in the Senate explain to the Senate and the people of Australia what are the claimed legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means by which this Government proposes to hang on to power without the passage of Appropriation Bills? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people have repudiated them in the same way as they repudiated them last year when they forced this country to a double dissolution and in the same way as ultimately they will repudiate them when in good time, in accordance with proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions, this Government does go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I did notice that the Loan Council was not standing by, and it seems to me somewhat amazing, from a government that is so concerned with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues of the day, that the Loan Council, which the Government obviously was circumventing on the strange assumption that 20 years was a temporary period, was not standing by in this crucial moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crisis has not just become what it has been intimated to be- a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or conventional crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should not be led astray, we should not be led off the track, by assuming that the solution lies purely in the area of  Mr Khemlani  or in the area of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or conventional issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because the Prime Minister finds that the Senate seeks, through the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers that it possesses, to refer the performance of this Government to its masters, the people, that his reaction now is quite different to his reaction only 18 months ago, quite different to the action that he advocated in this Parliament for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Besides the views of  Mr Justice  Murphy,  Sir Robert  Menzies and  Mr Whitlam,  we have the view of Quick and Garran, the interpreters of the Constitution, the view of  Mr Odgers  in his book  Australian Senate Practice,  and the views of a number of professors of law, of prominent Queen’s counsel and of many other people interested in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> circumstances of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We can forget in some measure about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues which are virtually settled and agreed to by all sides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next major breach of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention was the decision made by the Opposition on 16 October to defer consideration of those Bills which make up the totality of the Budget until such time as the Government submitted itself to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Senate rejection of supply would place at risk the maintenance of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sorry fac;s are that the Senate, through its threatened refusal to pass Supply last year, went a long way towards creating a precedent that threatens Australia ‘s long-term stability, and that its success in forcing the Government to the polls this year, or early in 1 976, would make that precedent a regular element in Australia’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now in 1975 a similar situation has arisen but it turns out to be a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister says that it will be legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and that no course which involves any breach of the law will be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions distinguish between the two Houses of the Parliament in relation to money Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions dealing with money Bills are section 54 and 55. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an attempt were made to ignore one of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> directions it is not clear what the consequences would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt if it were proposed in the Senate to amend a Bill imposing taxation, the  President  would rule the proposal out of order as unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the High Court would refuse to entertain any action to prevent the Senate attempting to pass an unconstitutional amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Wright  would care to cast his mind back to the time when he was sitting on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs when it was inquiring into the National Compensation Bill, he might well remember some evidence which was given to the original inquiry into rehabilitation and compensation in Australia by  Mr D.  G. Pettigrew, the managing director of Sun Alliance Insurance Limited, which is a multinational and which is the oldest still existing insurance company in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite any arrangements which the Government may be negotiating with the trading banks at the present time, does the Minister agree that there will be no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to spend such funds until Appropriation Bills are passed by both Houses of the Australian Parliament and have received the assent of the GovernorGeneral? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2) 1975-76 for the reasons given in the Senate resolutions is not contemplated within the terms of the Constitution and is contrary to established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We definitely have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis on our hands, and we also have a political crisis on our hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a working rule has for the present been adopted, based upon what is called the theory of <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Government, which lays down that the continued life of an Administration is practically dependent solely upon its enjoying the confidence of a majority of the House of Representatives, and that it is sufficient if it enjoys that confidence without regard to the views of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His wide acquaintance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, his broad grasp of the principles, and his keen powers of analysis were invaluable in laying down the lines of the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His name will go down in history as that of a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, who founded on an enduring basis the traditions of the great Court over which he presided with such distinction for more than 1 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Upon it  Sir Samuel  stamped the impress of his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> mind- in itself sufficient to give him enduring fame- and first draft though it was, the Bill of 1891 in its main outlines was accepted as the framework and basis of the Constitution drafted by the National Convention of 1 897-8, and finally approved by the people as the charter of Federal Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be noticed that the Chief Justice is not on record here as interpreting section 53 as denying to the Senate the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to reject a money Bill, whether it be one which is amendable or one which is not amendable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not refer to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> powers between the 2 Houses but simply lays down  Sir Samuel  Griffith’s views as to the principles by which the Governor-General should guide himself in a double dissolution situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not accept the manner in which the election was brought about and it will continue to explain to the Australian people the wrongness of what was done and the inherent dangers which those actions have brought to the Australian parliamentary system, in the hope that the Australian people will recognise that there must be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes in this country which would prevent any political party ever again bringing about the event that we saw last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that lunch he freely discussed the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not have a continuation of what was an extremely unsuccessful election campaign; rather, let us have people considering whether any form of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, analogous to this, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which cannot be ignored by this Parliament or by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I say that there should not be in our minds any idea that the various <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues which have received attention and attracted importance in the last few months will just go away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not matters which will be resolved in the type of heated debate which we have had in the last 2 days, lt would be well worth our while to put them aside for 6 to 9 months, but not much longer than that, so that they could then be considered, perhaps at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which will be recalled or in some other forum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think this matter will be resolved until it is resolved by a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection I should like to refer to an extract from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on clauses of the National Compensation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think, idealistically as  Senator Missen  spoke, that what he was suggesting to members of the Opposition as to what we could do about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems that face this country is stretching the credibility of his argument a little too far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was suggesting that perhaps in about six or nine months time issues such as the powers of the Governor-General, who at the moment seems to have the powers of an absolute monarchy, and the powers of the Senate, which at the moment is the most powerful House of Parliament in the world, and the problems created by these powers, which have been confirmed by the actions of the Governor-General in November and the elections since, can be discussed perhaps at a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one on this side of the chamber or, I suggest, on that side of the chamber- not even  Senator Wright-  and certainly no one in the House of Representatives will suggest to me or to anyone else that, while John Malcolm Fraser is the Prime Minister of this country and we have a conservative regime such as that we have now, there will be any possibility of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment or even discussion of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Mr Fraser  is about and what the others are about is power, and any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment would decrease that power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did its duty not only in the legislative sense by passing a whole mass of legislation but also in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense and, if I may use the words which are used by the  Clerk  of the Senate in his book, in the institutional sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, if any man had dared to stand up and tell the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of 1897-98 that the Senate could not reject or defer Supply the Constitution would never have been accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  saw fit at that time to take the circumstances of a deadlocked Parliament to the people, as was the traditional and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> necessity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it most extraordinary that we should be concerning ourselves today and over this last week with Opposition efforts in this chamber to assert that the action of the Senate was a threat to democracy and the action of the GovernorGeneral, as the ultimate force in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> set-up of this country, was in some measure a threat to democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significant character and quality of a one party State is that the Prime Minister of the day usurps the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions which should be carried out either by a Governor-General, in the case of Australia, or in the case of a republic- which  Senator James  McClelland so earnestly advocates for Australia and which  Mr Whitlam  prophesied would be established here in his own liftime- by a  President,  who would be turned into a cipher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not make the decision right and it does not say that they cannot be enlightened about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues, about the morality of the decision or about any of the other subjective factors involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the Governor-General say when he talks about his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows that the Governor-General must act upon the advice of his Ministers, his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> advisers, when that advice is finally and formally given to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all the issues that might come before this Senate- this place which was formed as a result of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conferences, this place in which it was agreed by the States that they would have equality of representation as a precondition for their joining the federation- what is the most significant issue in that sense? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis- as it was called by the then Government, the present Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were allegedly going through a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committees that  Senator Withers  has suggested should be established are the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, the Education and the Arts Committee, the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, the Social Welfare Committee, the Trade and Commerce Committee, the National Resources Committee and the Science and the Environment Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some advocated a system of joint committees while others, each with their own view of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> differences between the two Houses, urged separate committee systems for each House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the  Clerk  of the Senate argued that ‘joint committees subvert bi-cameralism’ and that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> roles of the Houses militated against joint committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On policy committees the Senate has a separate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role when compared with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under his chairmanship the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs carried out a very valuable exercise which was reflected in debate in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mention has already been made of the reference to the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs of the Family Law Bill when it was introduced into the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Central Intelligence Agency engaged in scores of plainly unlawful and improper invasions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights during its 28-year history, including domestic breakins, wiretaps, mail openings and data-collection on thousands of Americans, the Rockefeller Commission reported yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is all that the decision of the GovernorGeneral meant, and it was an entirely <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a crisis concerning the very legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> fabric of our system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I am a layman I would not like to enter the arena and try to dispute what are the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legalities, what they should be and whether the situation should be remedied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are, analogous to this, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which cannot be ignored by this Parliament or by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen went on to refer to three of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions that should be investigated and resolved to the satisfaction of not only the Senate but also the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Senate has an undeniable responsibility to the Parliament to remedy the unresolved <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> anomalies that cheated the Labor Government of office last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that an investigation should be made by a Senate committee into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legalities of the position and that the matter should be sorted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of my colleagues in an earlier stage in this debate said- I think it was  Senator Rae-  that if the Labor Opposition believes there is a real political or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue raised, let it bring forth a proposed amendment to the Constitution or let it raise the matter as an amendment to the motion which we have before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is obviously not possible in my case but mention might be made of 3 people from amongst all those who have fought for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the former Government assumed office in 1972 great forward steps have been taken in the field of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General has at least 2 clear <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> prerogatives which he can exercise- the right to dismiss his Ministers and appoint others, and the right to refuse a dissolution of the Parliament or of either House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also said  Sir John  had no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to dissolve Parliament on the advice of the minority party in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such be the section’s purpose and intended operation, how is it possible consistently with the Constitution that a reserve power of uncertain existence and unknowable constituents must be exercised in a way necessarily denying effect to the one <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision expressly directed to the solution of deadlock between the Houses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his summary of reasons,  Sir John  said: ‘If the Prime Minister refuses to resign or to advise an election, and this is the case with  Mr Whitlam,  my <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority and duty require me to do what I have now done- to withdraw his commission and to invite the Leader of the Opposition to form a caretaker Government . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a few days we had an express confirmation of the power from no less a jurist than the Governor-General himself supported, as it was, by a plain, succinct and clear opinion without qualification by one of the most eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers who has ever practised or presided over a Bench in this country,  Sir Garfield  Barwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all neatly summarised for us in the document which the  Clerk  of the Senate, through the  President,  laid on the table at the opening of this session when he succinctly put forward a view of the striking steps made in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development during the 3 years of Labor challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For anyone to argue that the Senate should not have the power to withhold Supply is to misunderstand <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> intent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, if any man had dared to stand up and tell the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of 1 897-98 that the Senate could not reject or defer Supply the Constitution would never have been accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A proper classification of what are the ordinary annual services of the Government in order to protect the Senate’s <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power of amendment in respect of certain money bills (1901-2, 1924, 1952, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1968). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that any purposeful student of this situation will now ask himself seriously whether this Senate has the legal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to reject or defer an appropriation or Supply Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> course of a government whose appropriation of Supply Bill is rejected or deferred is then either to advise a general election or to resign, let us consider the propriety of the exercise by the GovernorGeneral of the powers that he exercised on 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that danger the reserve power of the Crown, and especially the power to force or refuse dissolution, is in some instances the only <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> safeguard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a succinct piece of advice that should be written in bold letters so as to enshrine it as a clear statement of clear <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In England the chief judicial officer, the Lord Chancellor, is a member of the actual Cabinet and is privy to consultations not merely upon <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters but on all political matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our conversations I indicated that I considered myself, as Chief Justice of Australia, free, on your Excellency’s request, to offer you legal advice as to Your Excellency’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and duties in relation to an existing situation which, of its nature, was unlikely to come before the court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to Your Excellency’s request for my legal advice as to whether a course on which you had determined was consistent with your <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority and duty, I respectfully offer the following. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two relevant <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> consequences flow from this structure of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the Senate has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to refuse to pass a money Bill: it has power to refuse Supply to the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, a Prime Minister who cannot ensure Supply to the Crown, including funds for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election (of a kind which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation may then allow) or resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, being unable to secure Supply, he refuses to take either course, Your  Excellency  has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to withdraw his commission as Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very wisely, he took the course of accompanying his letter of dismissal to the previous Prime Minister with a statement of reasons to be publicised so that the country could understand that the purpose of the GovernorGeneral ‘s action was that the ultimate sovereign power in this country, namely, the vote of the people at a secretballot, could be obtained, and it would lead to a solution of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in making that assessment -  that is, the Governor-General’s assessment-  it is a common-sense as well as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although no doubt uncomfortable and irritating to those principally concerned, the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis in Australia is a marvellous example of the Constitution working well in a crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are in the midst of a political and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis which was already beginning to cause some hardship and much inconvenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He purported to dissolve both Houses of Parliament without any demonstration that he possessed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power at the relevant time to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The effective head of state in a parliamentary system is indeed bound to consult his law officers at all stages of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis up to the time when he decides that he is constitutionally required to reject this advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That opinion must certainly be correct when the effective head of state could reasonably form the view that his ministers were embarked on a course of gravely unconstitutional conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Governor-General was advised by the Chief Justice on this point as follows: ‘First, the Senate has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to refuse to pass a money Bill: it has power to refuse supply to the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, a Prime Minister who cannot ensure supply to the Crown, including funds for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election (of a kind which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation may then allow) or resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, being unable to secure supply, he refuses to take either course, Your  Excellency  has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to withdraw his commission as Prime Minister’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer ought to grant that the issues involved in this crisis have nothing at all to do with independence or colonialism, or hereditary monarchy, but everything to do with the rational coherence of the parliamentary system, which requires an effective head of state with the responsibility of acting in the way that  Sir John  Kerr has acted, in the most unusual sort of circumstances here involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the circumstances- the exceptional inflation in which the country was being drowned, the high interest rates, the record unemployment, the depressed rural industries, a tariff decision still operating to an overall cut of 25 per cent, a deficit in the Budget that is now approaching $5 billion, and the wake of the loans scandal, in which there had been an attempt to raise from external sources, by unconventional means, no less than $4,000m- it is a matter of great satisfaction that the public of Australia could be relied upon to solve a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis, to give confirmation to the GovernorGeneral, and also to solve a political crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be inappropriate to the remarkable occasion of the dissolution, its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> significance and the signal victory that the Australian people registered for the maintenance of proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> procedures and for the restoration to government of a government of responsibility not to deal with that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general election and upon his continued authority in the popularly elected House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The significant character and quality of a one party State is that the Prime Minister of the day usurps the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> functions which should be carried out either by a GovernorGeneral, in the case of Australia, or in the case of a Republic . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will remember also that the Liberal-Country Party senators when opposing the Bills on that occasion, found it appropriate to abuse, to misuse and to distort the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and parliamentary procedures and conventions in an endeavour to corrupt and mislead the people and the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of illustration of the difficulties confronting the Committee, it would have been necessary, in any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration, to deal with possible cases of a vacating senator who joined another party after election, became a member of another party because that party succeeded the party in existence at the date of election or who, for that matter, was not a member of any party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I desire to make some brief remarks in support of that motion which I move as a member of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any decision would be a matter involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment but that is a matter for further consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been speaking in general terms but it is with these matters in mind that I suggest this motion be agreed to so that the reference can be sent to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and enable a full examination of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that in the early part of 1975 those who are now in Government and the conservatives generally both inside and outside this Parliament were hell bent on destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that  Senator Wright  is in the chamber because he is a man with a long and distinguished interest in matters <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and I raise this next matter as a senator from Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Twice in a little over a year this same Premier intruded into an area which is unquestionably the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of the national government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had an argument about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and foreign affairs responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The prime objective of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as limited by the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth, is in respect of the prevention and settling of industrial disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the other part of the honourable senator’s question in respect of nuclear waste facilities, I point out to the Senate that in view of Australia’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and responsibilities under the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, any question relating to the establishment of nuclear waste facilities in Australia is a matter for the Commonwealth Government alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations, this concept can only be realised through a system of State Family Courts exercising State and federal jurisdiction covering the whole area of family law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As promised, this Government, immediately on being elected, began moves towards executive responsibility for the Legislative Assembly based on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development of the Northern Territory- recommendations which were available to the previous government for twelve months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report, which was presented to the Parliament by the honourable member for Hunter, as  Chairman  of the Committee, has made a valuable contribution to the Territory’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is tangible evidence of the Government’s determination to give effect to its election undertakings on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in its history it will be a responsible legislature in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This occurs not through any fault in this legislation but because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> constraints placed on any Australian government by the Federal Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit the embarrassment produced to the learned judge of first instance and to the majority of the Court of Appeal by the state of the decisions; but those decisions, in my humble judgment, or rather- for it is in nearly all the instances only so- these expressions of opinion by the way, have signified not alone an encroachment upon and suppression of private right, but the gradual invasion and undermining of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To remit the maintenance of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to the region of judicial discretion is to shift the foundations of freedom from the rock to the sand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it surprises me when I turn to the Bill to find that despite the fact that the High Court invalidated section 97 insofar as it referred to other courts in the sense of State courts, as I read the Bill there is no amendment put forward to section 97 although in other respects of custody and property there has been an attempt to alter the language of the Bill so as to come within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limits allowed by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is designed to reduce the definitions so that it only covers those things that are within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister been able to obtain a reply from the Attorney-General regarding  Senator Cavanagh’s  question without notice asked on 6 April 1976, viz: ‘What <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority has the Government to make home savings grants to single persons as proposed in a statement submitted to the Senate ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General has advised that it would not be in accordance with practice to furnish legal opinion on the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers in answer to a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>277), which provides a reasonable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis for the making of the grants by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An inquiry into Australian newspaper publication was not considered because the Commonwealth Government does not have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility with respect to the printed media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure honourable senators will agree the Government would be negligent in its duty if it did not take action to ban the advertising of such products in areas where it has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this connection the Government has agreed that the Minister for Health should pursue with State Health Ministers their proposals to work towards uniform legislation to control cigarette advertising in areas where the Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a High Court ruling on this matter and that is that that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision does not protect people in the Australian Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> gap in that should the Commonwealth acquire property in the Territories there is no obligation upon it to pay just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that people who live in the Territories ought not to be deprived of receiving just terms for their property that is compulsorily acquired merely because of an accident of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does matter is the fact that for the first time since I have been in this place there has been a party political attempt to upset the oldest presently existing active committee of the Senate which has enjoyed an enormous reputation not only within the Parliament but also among political scientists, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and those interested in the workings of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Mission would therefore like to know in general the problems with which the people of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands may be faced during their process of development, particularly  in  the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, administrative, economic, educational and social fields and in the field of general wellbeing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded that he was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and that the consideration by that Committee of the clauses of the National Compensation Bill last year probably saw the Social Welfare Commission functioning at its finest hour because it was the evidence and contribution of the Social Welfare Commission which more than anything else demonstrated the shortcomings in the proposed legislation and which led to its being withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were the factors which justified the breaches of convention in the Senate and which created a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis in this country which undermined the confidence of half the Australian people in parliamentary government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we did this also because it is the one area in which the Federal Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in relation to the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that requires an exercise of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lack of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power over the media in general terms including, for example, newspapers has the consequence that a government is unable to follow a consistent policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Opposition I very much regret that the Government does not have the capacity to influence more widely tobacco and cigarette advertising but, as I said earlier, I congratulate the Government on the steps it has taken within its present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>True it is that the Labor Government could not exercise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> control over advertising in newspapers or magazines, but it could exercise such control over radio and commercial television advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem about the fixation of a wages policy or about profits in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the years many moves have been made to bring about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also remind honourable senators that the Governor-General was appointed by the Labor Government of the day and he was described by the Labor Government of the day as a man eminently equipped in the law, and in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, to uphold the Constitution of Australia, which he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Theory of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention on Subject of Supply in Australia is not readily sustainable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The description by the paper writers of this as a literal interpretation of a merely theoretical power to refuse supply seems to be an attempt to use political arguments to determine what is essentially a question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is open to the Governor-General to obtain advice on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question from other quarters- perhaps from the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General or eminent counsel- and then a solemn responsibility rests on him to make a judgment on whether a dissolution is needed to serve the purpose of good Government … by giving to the electorate the duty of resolving a situation which Parliament cannot resolve for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is just because the Governor-General used his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers- those powers most people thought belonged to the days of yesteryear- to serve the interests of the Liberals rather than Labor that the men of good-will, men who may have been bothered by all those errors human frailty and folly had caused Whitlam and Co. to fall prey to, were filled with a righteous indignation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another proposal is to the effect that the  President  of India- another <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment makes it clear that the  President  of India can act only on the advice of the Government of India- can amend the Constitution for a period of 2 years; that is to say, for all intents and purposes the executive government has the right to amend the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been seen in other countries, once you start off on the road of taking away the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of people by whittling down democracy it is usually an unending process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Committee that made the recommendations regarding the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments- are calculated to emasculate the concept of checks and balances in respect of the exercise of executive authority by seriously diminishing the scope of judicial review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to refer briefly to a report in the  Canberra Times  today relating to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that that sort of statement gives rise to some concern among many public servants in the Territory who are associated with its administration or who may be associated with its administration following the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My personal concern is that a report of that nature may be taken to mean that no such assurances have been given to public servants who may be involved in or affected by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in the Austraiian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight in this chamber I seek a clear assurance from the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory that the statement made by the Government parties during the election campaign and the assurance which I gave on 4 August still stand and that public servants who, because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, may be involved in or transfer to the Capital Territory administration will have the same rights and terms and conditions as all other public servants under the Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister also noted that as of yesterday the 5-point program appeared to be reduced by one point, with the elimination of the proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment in relation to prices under the benign influence of  Mr Hawke? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year it was proposed to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Melbourne that a referendum be held to enable the Parliament to grant financial assistance to local government bodies in the same way as it has always been possible to grant assistance to State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not always that I agree with  Sir Eric  Willis, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, but I think he acknowledged the proper role of local government when speaking at a meeting of the Liberal Club at the University of New South Wales on 22 September 1976 when he said in essence that the role of local government should be defined by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an example we have only to look back as far as 1 974 when honourable senators opposite boycotted the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that when we raised the question at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, to which I was privileged to be a delegate, in Sydney in 1974 it was the very conservative representatives of the present Government as well as their counterparts in the States who were resisting any recognition of local government at all- firstly, at the Convention, and secondly, in any change in its relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heavens, America would be one of the last countries that we should try to ape in terms of the way in which <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that opportunity has, of course, already been given to local government and to the States at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention without much success or much progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, no matter how concerned we may be about certain matters that occur from time to time, no matter how much we may believe that a question of civil liberties is at stake, there is nothing that we can do unless those matters come within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth Parliament and the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the Commonwealth has the necessary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to legislate in this area and considers that it should introduce appropriate Commonwealth legislation into the Parliament during the current sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on its inquiry into the retiring age of judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what little spare time I had from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention during the week, I noted that a great deal of interest was shown by all people in Hobart in the arrival of the U.S.S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4, the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the retiring ages for Commonwealth judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee has made certain recommendations to the Senate relating to the retiring ages of High Court and Federal court judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also reference was made to this very matter at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention that was held in Hobart last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we would hope not only that the matter standing in the name of  Senator Missen  would be brought forward at an early date under General Business when Parliament resumes for the autumn session but also that the Government would see its way clear to act in accordance with this recommendation and in accordance with the recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which was held in Hobart by bringing down a Bill early in the next sessional period to enable the retiring age of judges of the High Court to be set at 70 years and of all other judges of Federal courts to be set at 65 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Australian Government uses its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the Australian Government uses its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to assist the Queensland Government and any other properly constituted body to develop and conserve the recreational, educational and scientific potentials of the natural environment of Fraser Island for the long term benefit of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week in Hobart I had the opportunity, during some part of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, to have personal discussions with the Lord Mayor of Perth about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I became aware of this matter last week at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart when one of my State colleagues from Queensland raised it with me informally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the authorities who have analysed the situation from a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point of view, such as Professor O ‘Connell,  Dr Forcey  and Professor Richardson, citing such authorities as  Mr Justice  Dixon for the right of the Senate to reject Bills with a consequent dissolution of the Parliament, bring home to the people of Australia how useful it is in this democracy to have a mechanism in the Senate with the power to reject a money Bill such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am suggesting here is that we should take a few minutes to remind ourselves that that is our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority and our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty on some occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak tonight in the hope that the Senate will interest itself in the development of the practice, that the Government will give consideration to it and that that practice will develop, notwithstanding the existence of the Public Accounts Committee and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure that has recently been set up, because all these matters require that this chamber considers its undoubted <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of request for amendment to be exercised on the appropriate occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the very issue,  Mr President,  that you and your colleagues used to bring down a properly elected <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government when you took the infamous action just a year ago of denying the right of this Parliament to look at the Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large part of the money that is granted is granted in terms that maintain the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following recommendations of Estimates Committees in 1973 and 1974 the Senate referred the question of the ‘ordinary annual services of the government’ to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and that Committee considered and reported upon the subject It appears logical and sensible that matters arising from Estimates Committee deliberations should form the bases for such further Standing Committee examination, and the continuation of the practice warrants the consideration of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This happened in 1973 and 1974, as  Senator Douglas  McClelland mentioned, when the question of the ordinary annual services of the government were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, they are established basically under State law because the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of power in respect of universities and colleges is a State head of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to 2 meetings to be held in Adelaide next week- one at the Adelaide Town Hall and the other at the Norwood Town Hall- on the subject of last year’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis and democracy in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had, of course, to consider the source  of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to enable the Parliament to enact the legislation and to confer the jurisdiction on the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the present case, I believe that the external affairs power provides a sufficient <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis for the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement recognises, in Article 5, that the signatories will need to pay regard to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and other requirements, such as the enactment of enabling legislation, before the Agreement can come into force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority, either in the Constitution or in the decisions handed down by the High Court, which says that the Senate can only make a request and that if it is ignored that is the end of the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator may have seen Press reports that during the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart  Mr Neilson  had produced his 24-point plan- I think there were 24 points in it- and the Prime Minister said then that the Commonwealth Government would give serious consideration to the matters raised by the Premier and, having studied them, he would be prepared to discuss them with the Premier of Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Primmer should know that the central responsibility to answer the question he has posed lies with the Victorian State Government because State schools, primary and secondary, are the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and financial responsibility of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Australian Government uses its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to prohibit the export of any mineral sands from Fraser Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Australian Government uses its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to assist the Queensland Government and any other properly constituted body to develop and conserve the recreational, educational and scientific potentials of the natural environment of Fraser Island for the long term benefit of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that the Senate should consider ‘its undoubted <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of request for amendment to be exercised on the appropriate occasion’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly the Senate’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility to exercise scrutiny of that expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the opinion of Estimates Committee F, as expressed in its report to this Committee, that the Senate should consider expanding the role of Estimates Committees to enable them to fulfil their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that on examining certain aspects not only of this edition but also of previous editions- but the last edition in particular- I find that in fact the book extends beyond what one could expect to see in a manual where it incorporates a personal opinion or alternatively a dogmatic assertion about matters of high <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> debate presently in train in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than the fifth edition being seen as I believe it should be, it is being seen as simply another contribution to the debate on the great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question which arose on this day last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate would also be aware of the very great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems that are presented to a national government in achieving its purposewhether it be a purpose of covering the whole field in the way in which the Labor Government attempted to do it or whether a national government decided to achieve a more limited purpose such as, for argument’s sake, the regulation of the securities industry alone without a full national Companies Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whichever way a national government wished to move in this area there would be very great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the concept of a Superior Court was developed by the Labor Government from the original proposal by  Sir Garfield  Barwick, it was found to involve many technical <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Needless to say, the course of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development for the Northern Territory may eventually require that the Supreme Court of that Territory have its own internal system of appeals and the Government recognises this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court now proposed will not, as would previous Bills to establish a Superior Court that have been introduced into the Parliament, perform judicial functions that can better be performed by State courts or create jurisdictional problems of a kind that might delight <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers but only add to the hazards of litigation for the parties concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement, that a Judge may be removed from office only by the Governor-General on an address from both Houses of Parliament in the same session praying for his removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity, is contained in clause 6 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Judiciary Amendment Bill, together with a number of other measures to be introduced separately will give to the State Courts new jurisdiction in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and in tax and industrial property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court itself will be better able to concentrate on its role as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> court and the final appellate court in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court occupies a position of special importance under our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is vital to the working of the High Court that it should be left free to concentrate on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues and on the fundamental issues of law that come before it in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court is empowered to order the removal into the High Court from a State court of any proceedings involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue before a State court involves an  inter se  question, it is automatically removed into the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An  inter se  question is one involving the mutual limits of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision was inserted in 1907 to prevent the Privy Council from dealing with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions of an  inter se  character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Appeals in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters can no longer be taken directly from State courts to the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because section 40A operates automatically in cases involving  inter se  questions it can cause inconvenience and sometimes can cause insignificant <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and other questions to be sent to the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions for removal of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues to the High Court by order of the High Court are to be extended to federal and Territory courts as well as State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The AttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth and the States are to be given a right to intervene in proceedings in all courts involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new provision is to be inserted requiring notice to be given to the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and of the State in which the proceedings are instituted in the case of proceedings involving <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues in courts other than the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing provisions forbidding State courts from dealings with  inter se  questions have operated to prevent State courts from making a substantial contribution to the interpretation of the Constitution, since most <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues involve  inter se  questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a wealth of information available to us in Australia from the reports of the Woodhouse Committee and the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill subsequently was referred by the Senate to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard absolutely nothing from the Government on this question, despite the fact that we still provide inadequate social welfare in this field- it is a field of social welfare- but it has apparently relied on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties which, at least according to some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers, are more imagined than real; on the alleged disagreements with the States; and on what I think to the Government would be most important, the opposition of those insurance companies which believe that at some stage the Government may bail them out and see that they are able to carry on lucrative businesses out of working people’s misfortunes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it may have been glossed across by  Senator Wheeldon  that there were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties in the national compensation scheme which was introduced, this in no way is an established fact to the degree that may have been pretended, that the scheme that was introduced could have been implemented in all its facets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If this Bill is misused against the people of this country I shall certainly introduce a private members Bill and use every other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means at my disposal to overturn it in 6 months’ time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To facilitate the process of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Northern Territory, the Government has established an interdepartmental committee to advise it on the long term financial arrangements to apply to the Northern Territory and to examine and report on all the issues requiring decision between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-75-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Primarily, the matter is one for the higher education authorities in the Queensland State Government because, as the honourable senator will know, the primary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for such colleges rests with the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, we support the Bill because we believe it is correct that the Australian Government, being responsible for exports, should take financial responsibility for its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in relation to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ill behoves those who believe that because we want to exercise our rightful and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> prerogative of adequately debating Bills and drawing attention to what we consider to be the deficiencies of the Government and its inability to comprehend the total picture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other problem with the Housing Corporation is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations of this Parliament in relation to housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which the functions of the Corporation are set out in the Australian Housing Corporation Act reveals the very clear <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations of this Parliament in relation to housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Court now proposed will not, as would previous Bills to establish a Superior Court that have been introduced into the Parliament, perform judicial functions that can better be performed by State courts or create jurisdictional problems of a kind that might delight <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers but only add to the hazards of litigation for the parties concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man- a prominent lawyer and a former member of this Parliament- has been active in the past few months as a propagandist on behalf of the Government’s side of politics in respect of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> events of last year and has made several quite vicious attacks upon the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the transfer of Australian Public Service staff to the Northern Territory Public Service as a further step in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was confirmed by the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee appointed to inquire into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This BUI is an essential component of the new and expanded <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status that we are seeking to confer on the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I present 2 reports from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on its inquiry into: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is that there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to pay it to a single person, to an engaged couple or to two single persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power for the Commonwealth to be involved in housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous Act the Government had the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to pay the grant to married people because it had <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights to give benefits to families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority has the Government to make home savings grants to single persons, as proposed in the statement submitted to the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General has advised that it would not be in accordance with practice to furnish legal opinion on the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers in answer to a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>277), which provides a reasonable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis for the making of the grants by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am wondering now whether this is one of those things which are done in the belief that there will never be any challenge to their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This brings up a most serious question which concerns me: Is this Government much concerned with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of its legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there would appear to be no legal support for the direction of the Government given in the hope that if a payment is made no one will challenge it and the Government will get away with something for which perhaps there is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and which is not what Parliament intended when it enacted an Act of Parliament creating the benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it falls far short of giving the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power which the Government believed in 1964 it did not have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh has raised a useful point, but my advice is that the Government is satisfied that there is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> head of power to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government has failed to accept its full <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility, which it gained as a result of the 1967 referendum on Aboriginal rights, to regulate and administer all matters affecting Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the Northern Territory is commencing a new era of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#debate-83">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an exercise of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and its responsibility to make special laws for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people where a need is seen for that to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an exercising of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and responsibility to make special laws for the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders where a need is seen for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sound a note of warning that if this amendment is not accepted it will be possible that where a motion to disapprove a proclamation is moved such a motion may remain on the notice paper for the required fifteen sitting days and not come before either House for debate, but the amendment ensures that when such proclamations are made they will remain subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and debate thus fulfilling the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements given to this Parliament in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result was that, although the Senate would not reconsider its previous decision, the then  Senator Murphy  moved a motion to make the Ordinance an Act for 6 months- I think, so that it could be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee is to be commended for the work it did in producing its report on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Universities and colleges established in the States are established under a State <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power which the Governor-General has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> link between the Labor Party and its parliamentary members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know the extremely difficult and complicated <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position which arises in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that, with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position as it is, the matter can be properly resolved only by joint legislation between the Commonwealth and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I know that honourable senators and many other people may well become impatient about these matters  -Senator Georges  certainly seems to be in that state at the moment- it is the Government’s view that it is far better to bring forward a scheme which has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> force and effect than to bring forward some half-baked effort like that which the previous Government, of which  Senator Georges  was a supporter, brought in and which  Senator Georges  and others who served on the Select Committee know would very likely have been shot down in pieces in the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, the Court looked at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision in section 24, namely, that the number of members to be chosen in the several States shall be determined ‘whenever necessary’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the procedures which I have outlined meet the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements as interpreted by the High Court in its McKinlay judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court held that the pre- 1964 provisions which reflected the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position were the operative ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rules applicable to that occasion therefore, I think, is of prime importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I resume the debate on this motion which relates to a report presented unanimously, by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter which was referred to the Committee for consideration and report to the Senate was the means by which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the Senate to amend proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for expenditure on matters other than the ordinary annual services of the Government should be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To reaffirm its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to amend proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for expenditure on all matters not involving the ordinary annual services of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This compact is sanctified- I suppose that is the best word- in the correspondence referred to by  Senator Missen  who, on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, of which he is  chairman,  wrote to the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  on 8 April 1976 regarding this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I feel that the Senate Standing Commitee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has done a useful purpose in recording confirmation of the 1965 compact and recalling the contention that went before that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To reaffirm its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to amend proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for expenditure on all matters not involving the ordinary annual services of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these proposals stem from the Hobart meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proceedings at Hobart have given the Government some basis upon which to determine what proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform have a real likelihood of being approved by the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the relevant <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements are not changed there could be as many as four elections from 1978 to 1981 and as many as 14 elections over the 20 year period from 1 96 1 to 1 98 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal is in accord with a unanimous recommendation that was made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in its 1958 and 1959 reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one, moreover, for which substantial support was expressed from both sides of Australian politics at the Hobart meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in October last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were brought to attention by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in its 1959 report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More recently they have been under consideration by Standing Committee ‘D’ of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which noted that they would be cured by the simultaneous elections proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following resolution was adopted at the Hobart meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements precluded similar provisions being included in relation to Judges appointed to the Family Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment provided for in this Bill is in accordance with recommendations made in October last year by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and by the Hobart meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee considered that the Constitution itself should provide that High Court Justices be required to retire on reaching the age of seventy years and that Parliament should be empowered to fix the maximum retirement ages of other Federal Judges subject to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limit of seventy years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, by an overwhelming majority, adopted the Senate Committee’s recommendation in its own resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three important safeguards embodied in the present proposal, all of which were contained in the recommendations of the Senate Committee and the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the Hobart meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention have recommended this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to give electors in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory a vote in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums was also the first item on the agenda of the meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart last year and was overwhelmingly endorsed by that Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may come as a surprise to many Australians that electors who are resident in the Territories are not at present entitled to vote in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But now that these Territories are rapidly growing communities with representation in both Houses of the Federal Parliament there is no sound reason to exclude them from participating in the process of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The indications from the Hobart meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention are that the proposal that Territory electors should be given a vote in referendums has overwhelming support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If those Bills should be completed quickly tomorrow we will certainly broadcast the debate on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills and then they can be further debated on Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government announced on 17 December 1976 that it intends to continue to accept responsibility for maintaining Norfolk Island as a viable community and that its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship with Australia would remain that of a Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have planned this exercise have taken the precaution of putting on notice the responsibilities that accrue to this chamber under the Standing Orders and under a contingent notice of motion that standing order 242 should be suspended in order to speed up the processes by which the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amending Bill can be forced through the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, manifestly and I assume in conjunction with the Opposition, already has a scheme, that is, that no impediment is to be placed before this Senate, whose position is being placed in jeopardy in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> sense, by allowing the means by which the Senate can defend itself to be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had its genesis in the debates in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention prior to Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable Senators might say that the public had an opportunity at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, but the ordinary public, the rank and file of the Australian community, did not have a chance even to be present at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, not all viewpoints of this Parliament were represented at that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was for all those reasons that the Senate in its original wisdom said that in this chamber, following the second reading of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bill that honourable senators perhaps supported and voted for, there would be a 3-week delay before the third reading was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trying to deny the people of Australia an opportunity to engage in discussions on the formulation of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is nonsense because we know that these proposals in the main and with one excellent exception which the Government has improved on have been formulated and discussed over a period of years by a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>242 is one which was very suitable in the horse and buggy days, in the period in which honourable senators had to be called from far away when a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment was being considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am obliged to say that to my knowledge, prior to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of last October, there was no consultation as such on this issue of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support what  Senator Martin  said with respect to the matters discussed by the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view is that when we are discussing matters that have been referred to us by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention it is fair to suggest that before substantive propositions are put before the Parliament, those propositions ought to be subjected to consideration by a subcommittee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the Government would have mentioned to the Opposition that it intended to jettison those proposals and then to proceed with the debate on these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would cut out the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> independence of the Senate and open the way for progressive reduction of its powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The innocent abroad, the elector who is expected to cast an intelligent vote in relation to these matters and to differentiate between what he wants and what he does not want by way of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, would expect to find any provision in relation to casual vacancies in the Senate in a Bill entitled Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as we on the Opposition side are concerned, we have supported the proposals contained in this Bill consistently in the 3 <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions which have been held in the last 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality of this proposal is that when it is passed, if it is passed, the Senate will more truly reflect the people’s wishes than it has even done before, except when as  Senator Wright  quite correctly pointed out in his dissenting view to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee of 1959, that up to that time there had been very few occasions when Senate elections and House of Representatives elections were held separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be no doubt about that because we believe in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, not just for its own sake but because of the experience of this Parliament and the experience which the government of Australia has had at the hands of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that it is a somewhat phoney proposition that because of  Senator Harradine  ‘s false rhetoric in this matter the people should have a say in the drafting of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the whole of Australia the percentage voting in favour of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill was 48.3. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in relation to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am confident that its forces will carry through the Senate and that it will carry with other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums through the poll which will take place on 21 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may well be seeing a new era where <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations that have gone through the vetting of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention, come to the Parliament and then gone to the people will be treated by the people in a new way- not the way to be found in previous dealings with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment when fog, fears and so forth have overwhelmed them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate I must speak only to the general matter in the simultaneous elections Bill and not to the other <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration Bills which I also support enthusiastically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 does not diminish the sole authority of the Queensland Government to direct and control the management of State-owned land when that authority is exercised within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-51-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place, the Court looked at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision in section 24, namely, that the number of members to be chosen in the several States shall be determined ‘whenever necessary’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I think there is general acceptance in the Parliament of what might be called the theoretical proposition of one vote one value, there must be a recognition that in the Australian Federation, with the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> entitlement to 5 seats and with the Territorial representation, the proposition of one man one vote in this community is mathematically impossible to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact they have had the endorsement in all essence of a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and were considered there in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The four questions being put to us in May were endorsed by the majority of delegates at the Hobart <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another fundamental reason why these referenda propositions, now contained in this Bill in particular, should be accepted is that, as I have already said, they have had the substantial endorsement of, and have been discussed at length by, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which has been meeting off and on over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel therefore that it is terribly important that these proposals, which received the overwhelming endorsement of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last November, should succeed and show that we in Australia can go through a rational process of discussing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the forecast that the result of these propositions will be that we will get a new approach to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately this has been the process of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform in this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from this being something which can be turned against politicians by saying that we do not want more of them so we should vote against the proposal, I think the Australian people will be ready to say that we have had over the years too many elections and too often and that situation will be solved by the proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the sorry history of reform which we have had over the years could well be changed by this series of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is terribly important to us is that these referendum proposals are the first that emerged from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all the proposals were discussed and dealt with in that Convention and they are therefore the products of a rational consideration of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving that major argument which applies to every one of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments I turn to the matter of simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know also that if we proceed without the acceptance of this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment we will have about 14 national elections between 1961 and 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment in relation to simultaneous elections will ensure that elections for the 2 Houses are brought together, and we can have at such elections a full national debate on issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the people of Australia are becoming more accustomed to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I move from that question of the benefits involved to point out that the argument of constructive government which I present under this oil arrangement is one which has been debated before particularly by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote extracts from the 1959 report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe in the arguments which we have heard, which we will hear and which I have heard around the Senate already that somehow a government, under this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal, will rush to another election immediately after an election in order to bring out a hostile Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons and trusting that the ideas of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions will meet with the favour of the Senate and the people, I support the Bill with all my heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program provides, in any event, that after disposal of the first 2 Bills on the notice paper today, namely, the Customs Tariff Validation Bill and the Defence Force (Retirement and Death Benefits Amendments) Bill, the 4 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Bills will be disposed of not later than 5 p.m. tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That requires, therefore, a short reflection upon what is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find in the second reading speech of the Bill the words of  Mr Ellicott  and  Senator Durack  stating that this legislation represents the unanimous view of the most formidable committee that has ever sat to consider <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> revision in the 76 years of Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say at once that in my opposition to this proposal in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee, I made it plain- I circulated the text of my remarks to honourable senators 2 days ago- I have no objection to simultaneous elections as such; what I have objection to is using that rather superficially attractive expression to induce people to adopt a Bill, when the real effect of it ls to undermine the powers and give the go-by to section 57. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was because of that power that there has been such unanimity and sustained advocacy on the part of Labor ever since the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Committee of 1959- it continued through the term of the Whitlam Government and now in to this debate- for the abolition of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated so in the 195 8 report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review, saying that - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although 1 1 members of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee advocated a measure such as this in 1959- an advocacy from which I dissented- Menzies had sufficient prudence not to bring in a measure which would have undermined the Senate even at that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people say that we should be able to lead public opinion but we also ought to reflect public opinion, and public opinion was declared very firmly in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum of May 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>would cut out the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> independence of the Senate and open the way for progressive reduction of its powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think another honourable senator said that there has been a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Good lord, so <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions change immutable principles! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who attended that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Need I read out what was said by the Australian Labor Party and the Government about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and its worthlessness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that not every opinion represented in the Parliament was represented at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the rank and file of the Australian community was not represented at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As occurs with all attempts in this and other countries to bring in sensible reform, whether it is legal, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or social reform, there is always opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> reform in this country is always difficult because of the methods that we must use to seek to change the Constitution and because people like those gentlemen who opposed the nexus referendum a few years ago can confuse the public with simplistic and dishonest arguments as were used then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that Australia needs protection not from sensible <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform but from the unthinking conservatism which opposes every form of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform, social reform or other type of reform that is ever put up in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support this Bill, which is one of four that relate to proposals to be submitted to the Australian electorate by way of referendum for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vital difference is that all the Senate is doing with this legislation is allowing the people of Australia to have the opportunity to pass judgment on proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been influenced in its decision by the widespread support accorded to these 4 proposals at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in Hobart towards the end of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went to the people with a referendum before holding a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the recent history of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions shows that in their early days they were not accepted by the people but I do not think anyone can deny that that is not the case today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was sorry to hear  Senator Harradine  denigrating the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in Hobart last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can call them socialist and anti-socialists if you like but there was strong support at that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, on both sides of the political spectrum, for this proposal and the other three proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fair to say, in this context, that when we are looking at questions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform they ought to be above party politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of 1975 will be a hallmark in the history of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is great need for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform in a number of areas and hopefully this will be one of the first instalments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if we look to the future and see what the present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision could require if there is no amendment to it we find that there could be as many as 4 elections between 1978 and 198 1 and as many as 14 elections in the 20-year period from 1961 to 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that many people did, and certainly the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review looked at this question before 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at what the 1958 Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review said about having too many elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate out of line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill- the one we are considering at present- I first wish to add strongly and emphatically opposition to the manner in which these Bills came before this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In common with all other honourable senators I assume, my first intimation of the existence of these Bills was last Tuesday on an aircraft when I picked up a newspaper and read that these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration Bills were to be brought in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote the  Hansard  record of the debate on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember sitting on Committee D of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However tainted the Government’s motives might be in introducing this Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill- terms such as political expediency, deceit, cynicism and hypocrisy, among others, have been thrown around by members of the Liberal Party of Australia and in my view the motive is quite clearly and incontestably the desire of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to protect half of his senators from the wrath of the electorate 12 months hence- the Bill provides an opportunity for significant <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are arguing whether a decision made at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention should go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever we may say about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and however many of us may like or dislike it, the fact is that the Federal Government, all State governments and local governments are represented on that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had hoped that they would scrap the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Federal Government is really the only instrumentality that can implement the decisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention we have a responsibility to act on its behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions it is possible theoretically for elections for both Houses of Parliament to be synchronised by holding elections for the House of Representatives whenever half Senate elections are due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it should be pointed out at the same time that this amendment is in accord with the unanimous recommendation made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in its 19S8 and 1939 reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, as has been mentioned, a great deal of support was expressed from all parties at the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in October 1976 in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Government proposes to do is to carry out an instruction from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention to see whether the people are interested in changing the ground rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that it was the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which suggested that the referendum be placed before the Australian people; it was not the Australian Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other reason why I am in favour of this Bill is that it reflects the clear indication of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention that this proposition, having been agreed to in large measure by that Convention, should be put to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In rising to speak tonight I find myself in complete opposition to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention had only just been convened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention had many meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is these 4 proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform which the Government is now putting to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all are well aware that for some years there has been talk of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Various intellectuals, academics and political commentators, and, in particular the Australian Labor Party, have been trying to achieve <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not call that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform; I call that revolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This view is taken in the light of the decisions of the last Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Diamond Valley had cared I would have been only too prepared to have allowed him to have incorporated in  Hansard not  only those significant passages from the 1958 report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee but also the reservations that were expressed by  Senator Wright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that I am no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, as are some of my predecessors in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise, however, that the executive Government, the Opposition, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and the States believe that the proposition should go ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in relation to this Bill, we see a Liberal Government almost ambushing the Parliament and rushing the Bill through on the shallow pretext that it was considered and found to be necessary by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which okayed such reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators refer to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> debates back in the late 1800s they will find that that is true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It means that necessary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, real reform, in this country is being put in jeopardy as a result of the action being taken apparently by a majority in this chamber today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are important questions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had kept any record or paid any account to the proceedings of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, they would have been aware that as long ago as 28 October 1976 there was a recommendation from that Convention that this Bill, in the form it now holds, should be brought forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we all are to be men of absolute consistency it seems to me that we will never make progress with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change and reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change has been a politically devisive issue in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole concept of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has been to try to bring the warring parties together around the conference table so that they can agree on desirable changes to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which is now quite an old document I found a good explanation of why too many elections should not be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with the majority view of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that in 1974 this referendum was put forward before there was any talk of a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and before the States and the Commonwealth came together to try to devise solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We put this forward as something which has come not just from this Government but from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which, I understand, has the support of every parliament in the Commonwealth and which has met seeking to bring us together to update the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was speaking of  Mr Whitlam:   is moving step by step to remove first one and then the other <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objections hoping that the people will not see his real object until it is too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention did not meet in 1974 is quite irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There had been a recommendation as far back as 1958 by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review on the need for this legislation to be carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has brought forward this proposal for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform along with three other proposals that the Senate will be debating subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sovereign power comes from the people themselves and it will be the people themselves who will decide the fate of the proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change that are contained in this Bill and the other Bills in the package before the Senate, as they have done on other occasions when there have been proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal for a referendum concerning amendment of the Constitution arises out of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and the deliberations of that Convention at the end of October of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of speakers in the debate have emphasised the need for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review and reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the only real measures of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform that hitherto have been feasible have stemmed largely from the interpretations of the High Court of Australia, which, of course, is not subject to the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the movement for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform has been a most important one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, which was established in 1973 and which proceeded through to the end of 1976, will continue to proceed because it was decided in 1976, as a result of progress made in Hobart, that it would meet again in Perth at the end of 1977, and there is every hope that it will do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is to have any prospects for the future and any credibility with the people of Australia- the electors who ultimately will decide these matters- it must be seen to be having some practical effects and not simply to be a talking shop wherein the politicians of Australia gather from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the fundamental fact about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view and in the view of the Government which I was expressing, the power of the Senate to which I am utterly devoted and which I will always support will reside, firstly, in that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> guarantee of equal representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point,  Mr Minister,  is that when we bring in those shortened terms for honourable senators which coincide entirely with the terms of honourable members of the House of Representatives, when we remember one ‘s experience here from 1975 or such a brief period as that or remember the whimsical reaction of  Mr Whitlam,  when we rely upon <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> experience throughout the democratic world in the last 25 years and when we remember the quotations which were given by  Senator Martin  and myself - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-50-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister considered the recommendation of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which reported in 1959 unanimously in favour of legislation to give the Commonwealth power over corporations, untrammelled by the limitations in the present Commonwealth power, which would enable a uniform companies Act and Federal legislation effectively controlling the securities industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the attitude of the Government to that proposal for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review reported in 1958 and 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services, calling upon his responsibility for the administration of the Representation Act which provides for the members of Parliament who are entitled to join in a No case on a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Attorney-General inform the chamber of the progress of the 2 consumer protection ordinances for the Australian Capital Territory, the Manufacturers Warranties Ordinance and the Misrepresentation Ordinance, on which the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs reported to the Senate in December 1976? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go back to the 1973 Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and the speech at that Convention by  Senator Ivor  Greenwood, the then shadow AttorneyGeneral, the then Opposition or Liberal and Country Party spokesman on matters to do with the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To synchronise the elections so that they would both take place on the one day-to compel that course of action by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, would be to weaken the effectiveness of the Senate because there would be a tendency for the Senate and the Senate’s interests to be submerged . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Melbourne in September 1975 the report of the committee on the synchronisation of elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives said as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the most disgraceful performance, to the eternal disgrace of the concept of a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, took place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In looking at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, to be most generous, approximately 1600 words were spoken in relation to the whole of the matter, other than the question of casual vacancies and the question of who should issue the writs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was never considered by a committee and quite clearly it was never considered by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in 1976, other than on the most superficial basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to intervene to deal with the very extravagant attack on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention discussion which has just been made by  Senator Rae. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then waited to hear what he was going to say about the 1976 <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been made quite clear that the person who decides within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> period of 3 years when a House of Representatives election shall occur is the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> writers and practice indicate that there is no real limit upon that man’s judgment to require a dissolution of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he supported the clause because the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention had endorsed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the reason for us to support this particular clause of the Bill is that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention endorsed it- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing that  Senator Missen  said in this debate was that all of these wise men sat down at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and carried this proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention decided to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine  says that the only reason given by the Government is that the amendment is not in accordance with the decision of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That indicates a fundamental lack of appreciation of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> safeguard of section 57 which provides that if the House of Representatives sends to the Senate a Bill which fails to pass and after an interval of 3 months the Bill comes again from the House of Representatives and we again fail to pass it, then, and then only, there may be a dissolution of the Senate, accompanied by a simultaneous dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One example was given by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959 in paragraph 238 of its report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am conscious of the fact that consideration is being given to this legislation today as a result of a determination by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention at which representatives of the 3 tiers of government throughout Australia, irrespective of party affiliations, were present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention debated this matter and, as I have said, took the view that the writs should be issued by the Governors of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention did not discuss this proposal in any detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numerous people who were at that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention had participated in debates on this matter in both of the Houses during those years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the only conclusion one can reach is that when the matter came on at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, by some strange form of osmosis there was a transmutation between the thoughts of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and National Country Party and there was no necessity for any debate whatever even to explain to anybody- for anybody even to raise a question- about all the things that had been put up in the preceding 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to hear some debate on that real issue instead of some statements saying that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention said something ought to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention did not debate it, its committee did not consider it and- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put up arguments other than that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention had agreed to this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are treated to this load of- this argument as being only one of the reasons along with the changed circumstance of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention having considered it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have liked the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention to have a proper debate about these matters, these real issues, that are raised here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had a committee of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention discussed this matter, considered it properly and come up with a reasoned view we may have had some basis upon which we could consider it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment all we are given is this totally superficial reason of cost and convenience and the fact that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention discussed it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention did not discuss it all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who looks at the transcript of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention will see perfectly clearly that the matter was never given any consideration by that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a person infantile in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation of this Federation could put it forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compressing myself to the utmost brevity, the last thing is that  Senator Steele  Hall sits down with the false misrepresentation of the motives, purposes and arguments of us who oppose these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations, saying that we are seeking lifetime appointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention considerable time was available to consider this matter and a definite recommendation was put. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill in its present form is being put forward in accordance with the decision that was taken after consideration and debate by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I think that the lawyers have not been as prominent in this debate as people sometimes think they are in debates on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine  objected to the Senate being tied to a decision of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention about which we have heard much detail from  Senator Rae  and others today and its validity has been challenged in a real way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason he gives us for accepting the proposal is that the lawyers decided on it at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Townley  ‘s interjection that the issues will be put to the people but we do nothing for the status of the argument, the proposal, the referenda or the Parliament if we put any old issue just for the sake of it on the untenable grounds that the Minister has put to us in relation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the view put by the late  Senator Greenwood  in moving for a committee consideration by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not considered or debated in detail in any way whatsoever at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in 1 976 or at any other time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum to make sure you behave yourself in future’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In wider terms one could say: ‘We should have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum to make sure that we behave ourselves in future’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For us, it might be described as the ‘lest we forget ‘ <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that it is in substance the provision which was approved of by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in substance the proposal which was approved of by the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review of 1959, although that Committee did not see the way in which it could be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support very warmly this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  referred to a meeting of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be done now only by a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that this matter was discussed by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of the amendment, which is likewise most valuable and originates from the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention last year, is the provision that the person appointed to fill a vacancy shall not just fill it until the next election, when he may be thrown out and proportional representation would no longer apply in the State he represented, he will in fact now serve the balance of the term of the person who was elected originally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Liberal Party have worked on and developed this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debate on simultaneous elections we heard constant references to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told how important it was that we accept the view of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and that any argument advanced against anything recommended by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention would be invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject of this Bill has been before Committee D of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It came to the conclusion that the original Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review on which  Senator Wright  sat was perfectly correct in saying that there was no possibility of getting a form of words which would meet this situation and put it beyond the risk of prejudice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It so reported to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention discussed it briefly to see whether it was possible to put into the Constitution something which would enshrine the concept that it should be the function of those people responsible for filling casual vacancies to be obedient to the principle; but it confessed that it was totally beyond legal expression in any form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was agreed to by all the Government representatives who were at that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and on Committee D. In Committee D it had the support of that eminent legal luminary who now sits in the High Court and once sat in the Senate; it was not possible to find an appropriate form of words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation clearly is that the Government cannot look to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and say that it recommended that there be a referendum on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention simply stated a principle and expected that those people present, including those in State governments, would take that principle back and implement it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be said that we should have known about it because the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention recommended that there should be an amendment to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who do care about the 1 975 incident should support any moves to have the deliberations of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in relation to casual vacancies investigated further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a member of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee which considered this subject in 1959 and reported unanimously that no formulation of words could be devised by draftsmen in the 3 years of the Committee’s consulations to give effect to this principle without invading fundamental principles which we have always held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As no division has been called for, I draw attention to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that this Bill must be passed by an absolute majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government received a report indicating that there will be serious legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties in implementing State income taxes and associated matters which are proposed under stage 2 of the Government’s federalism policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I hope that the debate will be kept to the highest of levels consistent with consideration of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in the Senate of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well for us on occasions such as this to reflect that the remaining <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> links with our mother country are embodied in the Crown, represented here this week by the Queen in person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also well for us to remember that we have a form of government known as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this day and age in which we live there are those among us- I hasten to say that I am not one of them- who espouse the cause of cutting the ties which link us with the British Crown and of establishing, in heu thereof, some form of republican government in this country by doing away with our role as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Knight’s question raises matters of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance and they will be given careful consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia unfortunately have a long record of making many decisions on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in an atmosphere of confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arguments are a poor foundation in which to find something to replace the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy with something which I can only see in the public debate at the moment as being a vague republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy, the establishment of the Queen of Australia, provides the Australian nation with the best possible head of state system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any person would argue in favour of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarch as head of state, all arguments must be placed with realism and, what is more, with contemporary, practical thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime, I believe that it would be unfortunate if I did not use this occasion to make one or two observations about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy, the strength of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy, what it stands for and what it means to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we must ask ourselves: What is the significance of the monarchy in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> setup of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have gone a long way in the development of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy in the Australian scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>’, his answer was that he really did not know whether it would be better or worse than a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy but he supposed we should try it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarch in the Australian context stands as a symbol of unity and as a symbol of the strength of a family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The monarchy as we see it in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> circumstance is removed from high pressure politics and, consequently, it has an enormous amount to commend it over the sort of presidential circumstance which is totally associated with an emotional, political era, sense and atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy as we have seen it develop through British countries and in Australia is something which we should be loath to forsake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill, which is a simple machinery measure, is to ensure that there is no legal objection to using for this poll the same ballot-boxes and polling booths as will be used for the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had agreed to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums before we reached the worldwide economic recession, it may well have been that we would have had greater safeguards against the recession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another alibi is the failure of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to realise that its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legislative function is to settle industrial disputes, and its failure to realise that it is an arm of government economic policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I refer briefly to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory as it is set out in a report of this Parliament’s former Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that majorities of voters in four States must agree to any proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change will not be affected by a ‘yes ‘ vote onMay21.TheStateswill still have the protection the Constitution guarantees them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that debate ought to range over the most vital subject of what form of government there should be within Australia; whether it should have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarch or whether it should be a republic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I report to the Senate that I have received a letter from the Leader of the Government in the Senate nominating senators to be members of legislative and general purpose standing committees as follows: <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs-  Senator Missen, Senator Chaney  and  Senator Rae;  Education and the Arts-  Senator Davidson, Senator Collard  and  Senator Martin;  Foreign Affairs and DefenceSenator Sim,  Senator Knight  and  Senator Scott;  National Resources-  Senator Thomas, Senator Maunsell  and  Senator Townley;  Science and the Environment-  Senator Jessop, Senator Bonner  and  Senator Townley;  Social Welfare-  Senator Baume, Senator Tehan  and  Senator Walters; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adoption of a proposal for legislative uniformity which recognises that the States are not required to surrender or refer any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a dangerous law would vitally affect the parliamentary system; it would cut out the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> independence of the Senate and open the way for progressive reduction of its powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking about whether the proposed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change would affect the Senate, in the statement the Leader of the Government in the Senate said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in the 1974 case quite legitimate and good <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arguments were presented for the No case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To hear him talk now you would think he always had been in favour of these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alterations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other matters I want to mention which were referred to in the Queen’s Speech relate to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were some differences of opinion in the Senate as is well known about the need for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform and the proposals which are being put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am already on the record as saying that I believe it is extremely important and we should to a great extent or as much as possible sink our normal political differences and try to achieve some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To some extent we are at the beginning or the end of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know the history of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now we have this system of having a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention at which people from all the States, from all the political parties and from the Commonwealth and all the political parties operating in that sphere can get together and, to the greatest extent possible, iron out their differences and arrive at agreements for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An excellent report was produced which recommended a number of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prospects for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform if we fail this time must be dismal indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if we fail this time we will be left in a situation of holding <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions of questionable value and use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a system of arriving at <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change which most of us would agree is unlikely to produce much <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that if we find that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change is impossible, perhaps the one thing we ought to do is to examine what other means are available to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that those of us who believe in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change can move together with maximum amiability, at least until 2 1 May 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue in Australia is not any of the four that we are putting forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question that we have to face is before sub-committee D of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and relates to the powers of this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had had an elected  president  during the time of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis, he would have had the power to do what  Sir John  Kerr did which was to dismiss us and send us to an election in the event that we could not agree to the carrying on of government by the granting of Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But really we ought to be talking about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Senate and what ought to happen in the resolution of deadlocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that with the smallest amount of goodwill it would be possible to agree around the Senate chamber with very few exceptions and it would be possible to obtain agreement out in the community that that very minimal change ought to be made in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure so that the Senate is not insulated from the results of its actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are earnest in this matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform, there is one signal service that the Opposition and only the Opposition can provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem we have to face up to, find a solution to and if <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change is necessary we have to be prepared to go to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill introduces a modification to the legislation to enable a song to enter the minds of the electors and for them to determine at the same time as they determine the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposals which of the 4 songs or tunes is acceptable to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators, before they allow the discordance that has arisen from that disgruntled experience to override the matter we are dealing with, which is predominantly the national song or national tune, before they allow any disharmony to come into the debate arising out of sourness and disappointment, to reflect how consonant it is for serious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions to have to be discussed along with a national tune. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am trying to examine how consonant it is that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues such as this should be considered at the same time as the selection of  Waltzing Matilda, Advance Australia Fair  or  God Save the King. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee accepted it as a principle and the Hobart meeting last October endorsed it as a principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Committee denied that the matter was appropriate for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A song is to be determined at the same time as a high matter of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> import relating to casual vacancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am showing how incongruous it is that with such high principles of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice and provision we are to vote for a song and a put that question in as a pretext for saying that it is an egregious mistake to have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum costing $5m to $7m in this time of stringent economic hardship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this time we come in- I see  Senator McLaren  waves to the music- with the idea that we put a song forward as a pretext for that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that when the Bill was before the Senate it was investigated by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall read from paragraph 34 of the report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the judiciary, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs stated in its report: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Am I correct in understanding him to say that the Commonwealth has before it 2 different opinions in respect of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the States in respect of stage 2 of federalism and the collection of an income tax? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received a letter from the Leader of the Government  (Senator Withers)  notifying me that  Senator Rae  has indicated that he wishes to be discharged from further attendance upon the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That  Senator Rae  be discharged from further service on the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rae  has decided that he will no longer sit as a member of the important Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and his great legal mind will be lost in the consideration of the Committee’s business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility over marketing and exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This commitment has been demonstrated in a wide range of reforms: The rapid advance to statehood of the Northern Territory, now underway; the granting of a greater degree of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory; active support for the participation in the Hobart <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention; the decision to put to the electorate the 4 referendums on 2 1 May; our undertaking to introduce freedom of information legislation; and our fiscal policies of tax sharing and tax indexation which will render State governments and the Commonwealth government more accountable to the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was under the impression that both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have consistently supported the various <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party contributed to the Hobart <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and has contributed to such conventions for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today I asked a question of the Minister, as I think  Senator Colston  and  Senator Walsh  also did, in an effort to learn from the Government whether it understands the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications of the implementation of stage 2 of the new federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The adoption of a proposal for legislative uniformity which recognises that the States are not required to surrender or refer any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find it extremely difficult to tear into the subject and obtain overnight solutions to situations, that involve deep rooted <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> positions and, as  Senator Georges  would well appreciate, political stands that have been entrenched since the creation of Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly the matter should be referred to the appropriate Senate committee-the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister will adjourn this debate and refer the matter for consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of discussions that have taken place in the last few minutes I think we can come to an agreement to refer the clauses of the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs provided that a report can be obtained from that Committee as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We appreciate the suggestion made by the Minister to refer the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are prepared to agree to that now in order to obtain a report from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders, the Clauses of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1977 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for consideration and report to the Senate on or before 26 April 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That the following 4 matters be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report to the Senate: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inside our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice whether it is written or unwritten- in this case in the situation in which we are involved it is unwritten- we have inherited a whole series of expressions of unwritten <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on a fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> theorem which exists in the English speaking world, whether it be in the United States of America or in Australia in 1977, and that is that in circumstances of peace the conduct of foreign affairs lies in the area of the prerogative power; it does not lie in the area of the parliamentary power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on the gravest of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues I oppose, first of all, setting up a special Senate select committee to look at an area of foreign affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties in the State of Queensland in determining replacements for retired senators under section 15 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Attorney-General agree that section 15 refers to a joint sitting of both Houses in appointing a replacement senator and as a consequence the Queensland State Parliament cannot meet this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They and they alone have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legislative power to implement legislation as to essential services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I present the report on the clauses of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1977 by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on 31 March 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government continues to take the firearm problem very seriously and certainly will have to deal with any proven problems in the Territories where it has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that delegates at the Hobart meeting agreed that it was impossible to find a form of words that would provide for all contingencies when filling a casual Senate vacancy, as did the 1958-59 Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Government proceed with this Bill in the knowledge that it did not conform with the spirit of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review 1958-59 was unable to find a set of words sufficient to write into the Constitution is not a sufficient excuse to say that the present Government and the Parliament have not found a way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was canvassed in the debate on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1977 in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question to the Leader is this: In regard to the proposal for casual vacancies, did the subcommittee of the Hobart <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention report that it was inappropriate to introduce into the Constitution as an amendment the principle of replacement from same parties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that is to say, the principle of replacement from the same Party, as a political agreement, was acceptable but because of language difficulty it was not capable of being drafted to make it a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is also fair to say that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, when my colleague  Senator Durack  was speaking to the motion, he indicated that the Commonwealth Government believed that it was possible to draft an amendment to be submitted to the people to put the principle in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I point out that at that Convention it was flagged that the Government believed that the principle was capable of being drafted and put into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While talking about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart, I remind the honourable senator and anybody else who cares to take notice, that I was not the only person between the referendum in 1974 and the present time to change my mind about simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if I have changed my mind once and if I have done that, as  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack said yesterday, by sitting on a penitent’s stool, I point out that I changed my mind after reflecting on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An offer having been made as to compensation, if the person concerned is dissatisfied he has the powers and the right- he has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right what is more- to apply to a court to have just terms determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say, as I have said all along, that if  Mr Aufferber  is dissatisfied with the offerthat is all it is, an offer of compensation made by my Department on proper advice- he has his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to resort to the courts and have the matter properly determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been urging  Mr Aufferber  to exercise his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question raises a number of matters of detail and also some of considerable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that change to the Constitution can be made retrospective in relation to the appointment of a senator, why cannot a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration have retrospectivity in relation to the present judges of the High Court of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment so satisfactorily passed by the electorate in relation to the retiring ages of judges does not apply to the present members of the High Court is that it does not purport to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator asks whether the relevant <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment will apply to the period for which  Senator Lewis  has been appointed to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We meet in a rather grizzly atmosphere after an ineffectual fortnight when an assault upon this chamber was defeated fortunately by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means which provided for the people of the 3 small States to have the chance by individual votes to defend themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what change in their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status has made it inappropriate for them to vote in subsequent, or future referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of thing can be imposed on any society only if one has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do so and the will to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 he was a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is probably well known to listeners of the  AM  program because of the comments he made in late 1975 and since then regarding <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claims to be an authority on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not argue against any claims he might make as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He questioned them about the cost of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums that were put to the people last Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Wood  that both the Prime Minister and  Senator Withers  cannot get away with it by saying that the referendums were introduced because of a resolution passed at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is on record as saying that at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention both  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  and  Sir Charles  Court had agreed with the proposition but that when they went back to their own States pressure was brought to bear, no doubt by the same people as brought pressure to bear on those honourable senators opposite who advocated a No vote, they changed their stance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, those two Premiers will not even abide by a democratic decision of a democratically constituted <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are advised by the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  that for certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons instead of having one Bill to amend livestock slaughter legislation there are four, five, six or seven Bills- I forget the number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the arrangements should be free of any significant <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> or other legal doubt; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They tried every <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> trick to get out of their justifiable taxation commitments, and they have been doing it ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for 5 separate Acts arises from a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that laws imposing taxes should deal with one subject of taxation only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-48-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wriedt pointed out that the Commonwealth pays entirely for the maintenance of universities and colleges; but he failed to point out, of course, that the whole <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and responsibility for all areas of education, except that of student allowances, resides in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is common ground that the Trade Practices Act does not have universal application throughout the community because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there was an application of the Act to the Territories within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forget the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> interpretation and then consider acceptance in principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a later stage I intend to move that it be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I foreshadow that I shall be moving at the end of my speech in the second reading debate that it be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘corporation’ is used because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that among the proposals which the Labor Party makes there is one that there should be an amendment to this legislation to refer it to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs considered the Australian Capital Territory ordinances in regard to manufacturers’ warranties and misrepresentation and made recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming back to the situation in Australia,  Senator Harradine  was trying to develop his argument, and I think the inability of some Government senators to grasp what he was saying justifies the Opposition’s proposal that the legislation should go to the Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs, which is one of our leading committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that if this legislation is to be handled in temperate discussion it should be sent to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which comprises people whom I would call big league legal luminaries, such as  Senator Missen  and my own colleagues  Senator James  McClelland and  Senator Wheeldon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I do not want to detract from the expert standing of members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, the Trade Practices Act and this legislation have been considered very extensively  Dy  experts of the calibre of those I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the limits on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of this Parliament, that other person has to be a corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770602_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not believe that the problems of providing an effective legal aid service will be solved simply by leaving the matter to the States- not because we believe that the attempts made by the Stales over the years have not contained a great deal of merit and have not contributed a great deal to the provision of legal aid services, but the fact is that the Commonwealth has a direct <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal responsibility in a number of areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister considered the recommendation of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which reported in 19S9 unanimously in favour of legislation to give the Commonwealth power over corporations, untrammelled by the limitations in the present Commonwealth power, which would enable a uniform companies Act and Federal legislation effectively controlling the securities industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the attitude of the Government to that proposal for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does not the Minister representing the Attorney-General recall that the recommendation of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review for the alteration of this power expressly recommended legislation that did not authorise this Parliament to regulate the trade and commerce of corporations, which is the effect of the recent interpretation of the High Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this not an instance in which <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> review is more properly done by referendum than by High Court interpretation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review reported in 1 959 in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1973 the first meeting of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention referred the question of amendment of the corporations power to its Standing Committee ‘A’ for consideration and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In doing so, the Government will take into account the recommendations made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government received a report indicating that there will be serious legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties in implementing State income taxes and associated matters which are proposed under stage 2 of the Government’s federalism policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects of implementing stage 2 of the proposed income tax sharing scheme have been examined, but no advice has been received by the Government that there are any serious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or other legal difficulties that would prevent introduction of appropriate enabling legislation by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with you that the proposition by Murphy J that United Kingdom Ministers ought not in future tender advice to The Queen on any matter involving Australian internal affairs goes beyond common understanding of existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles if it is intended to embrace purely State affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770817_senate_30_s74/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister, accompanied- I understand- by the Attorney-General,  Mr Ellicott,  recently paid a visit to Norfolk Island, can he now say what decisions have been made in regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the island and its future administration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators who were members of this chamber in 1 974 will recall that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs brought down a report on the Family Law Bill, then before the Senate, that was responsible for the insertion in the Bill of provision for the Family Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the report of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on a retiring age for federal judges, which led to the Constitution alteration, specifically recommended 65 as an appropriate age for judges of the Family Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives a quite unfettered right which is unavailable to any employer in this country other than the Commonwealth, a right which this Government has not the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in a direct sense to give to any other employer in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leave out all words after ‘That’, insert ‘the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the amendment seeks only to refer the Bill to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee to clear up all these legal points that are involved in the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one has yet explained- I hope that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs  (Senator Durack)  will do so in the Committee stage or in replying to the second reading debate- where the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to control employees in relation to industrial matters is to be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In spite of the differences that we have on some subjects, this is one matter on which honourable senators are not divided, irrespective of the advice which is proffered to us occasionally by people who have no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator would know from a number of questions that I have been asked on these matters that a great deal of discussion has taken place, that a broad outline of principles has been agreed on with an approach to this matter on a national, uniform, co-operative basis, contrary to the approach taken by the previous Government, of which  Senator Georges  was a supporter, which was for a centralised, national control, largely to the exclusion of the States altogether and without regard to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations that there may well be on this Parliament to take the sort of action that I gather  Senator Georges  supports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs three years ago, and it was applied and put into force with respect to the establishment of State family courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment of May 1977, this is something which can be done so far is the Federal Family Court is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It must be a matter of pride and great satisfaction to those honourable senators who served on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs that one of the important recommendations of that Committee resulted not only in legislation being passed through the Senate and hopefully through the Parliament but also in an amendment to the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I draw the attention of honourable senators to the presence in the Gallery of a delegation from the Swedish Parliament ‘s <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Committee led by the  Chairman, Mr Karl  Boo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In accordance with the undertaking made in October 1976 the Government has now decided to release a proposal for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Australian Capital Territory with the objective of encouraging widespread public examination and comment on the issues prior to a final decision being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After considering various reports on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Australian Capital Territory the Government indicated last year that there should not be any piecemeal delegation of functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Territory as the seat of government and national capital does not allow the Commonwealth to divest itself of responsibility for the government of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> pressure or other form of pressure that would stop the Government governing for another year, but it is talking about going to an early election and will not deny that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was accepted that in order to enable the government of the day to fulfil the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements upon it this method of accounting should be adopted, and it was recognised as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My principal reason for rising is to afford an opportunity to the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to bring the Senate up to date with the latest developments in regard to the activities of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to canvass the other references which the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has at present but to content myself with this report and the items in it, one of which has some updated information which I think should be made available to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in 1911 through a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change- South Australia gave up the responsibility of the Northern Territory which became the responsibility of the Federal Government- all parliamentary franchise was taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that organisation is not carrying out its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> charter then there are means of correcting that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has never been proclaimed because it is of doubtful <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity, but more importantly because the Government recognises that that rushed legislation is unworkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the time left to me I want to refer to the history of the trade union movement in Britain which shows that as far back as World War II there were concerted efforts to substitute irresponsible shop steward leadership for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> union leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this is a very worthwhile activity and it certainly highlights the legislative problems and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which the Government faces in dealing with these sorts of disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the evidence and material before it, the Committee became aware that the current system of reviewing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes can and does create serious problems, the most important of which arises out of the delays which occur in having the validity of legislation determined by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendation that a referendum be conducted to correct this deficiency is itself an indication of the importance of this matter and I hope that between now and when the report is more fully debated honourable senators, especially those interested in legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and processes, will give it their close study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of clothing the High Court of Australia with the responsibility for giving advisory opinions has, as the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs pointed out, been an issue in this country for well over 50 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Minister said in this chamber on 2 1 May this year when answering a question by  Senator Wood  in respect of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referenda: I am prepared to admit that I was wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  might remember that in October 1975 he was a member of the then Opposition that took action in the Senate to delay the Budget and bring about a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus the Lords agreed to the modification of the old-established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> formula whereby subsidies were granted by the Lords with the assent of the Commons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step towards a restoration of effective financial control would be the realisation that, under long-established British <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, defeats over details of the Budget or of Estimates are no cause for resignation, provided that they do not amount to denial to the Government of the entire annual supply or an essential part of it, and provided that they do not amount to the rejection of some major policy to which the Government had committed itself.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the exercise of their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions, the House of Commons not infrequently dissent from the financial propositions of ministers . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot accept the proposals suggested by  Senator Withers  to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That should be examined in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way and perhaps given more consideration, to ascertain whether a correct, legal interpretation of section 57 was made, or whether the Governor-General perhaps had an alternative course of action available to him in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The book represents an interesting extrapolation of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers which the Governor-General enjoys, and will I hope draw some critical attention to the sort of function which he performs, or ought to performwhich, of course, is a more important matter than is his salary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we should be looking also at the nature of the institution, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> function which a Governor-General has, whether those <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions are appropriate in 1977, as they were deemed to be in the Victorian era - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that, as a result of the presentation of this legislation which gives a handout to the office of Governor-General, honourable senators opposite who are so sensitive about decadent institutions in this country, including the office of Governor-General, should think a little more seriously about the nature of that institution, about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions which are imposed upon the Governor-General and about the way in which he in fact discharges those functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At different times different forces of experts, including lawyers and professors of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, have said what  Senator McLaren  said in a revised version of his opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  I put it to you that it would be sad if honourable senators or members of the Parliament were not allowed to express in the Parliament opinions which, while not being disrespectful, were critical of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> action which a high personage might take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem relates to the question whether Parliament should be committed to charges without those charges being referred to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the financial powers of the Parliament are abdicated by the refusal of the constituents of the Parliament to know and understand what is happening, the Parliament becomes reduced to an enigma and a cypher in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions of government and the power of the Executive becomes overwhelming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An election for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly will take place before the end of 1978 and issues of future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development for the Territory will be widely canvassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to move a motion for an extension of time for the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to report on the four matters, namely, the processing of law reform proposals, the delegation of parliamentary authority, the priority of Crown debts and parliamentary scrutiny of rules of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the date for presenting the report of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the four matters- Processing of Law Reform Proposals; Delegation of Parliamentary Authority; Priority of Crown Debts; and Parliamentary Scrutiny of Rules of Court-be extended until 31 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power is being used to enforce the situation because elections are coming up in Queensland and in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right to assign the land for the benefit of the Aboriginals, and the Labor Government was prepared to do that in Western Australia and in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition has been obtaining legal advice about how to avoid the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulty it faced when in government in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister agree that it is in the public interest that all communications relevant to Her Majesty’s consideration of the petition be tabled in order that their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications might be properly evaluated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He built up an extensive practice and appeared as counsel in several important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was at one time the  President  of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Club of Melbourne and showed an interest in that organisation for many years, constantly attending its lunches and meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that area, as Attorney-General and as a politician of great renown, he always showed a great deal of interest in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and an awareness of and interest in changes and ideas that came forward from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention this matter also because the election of  Senator Haines  was the first after the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration which provided for the filling of a casual vacancy by a member of the party with which the retiring member had been associated at the time of entry to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contention of the Liberal Party was that the party to which  Senator Steele  Hall had belonged at the time of election had now merged with the Liberal Party and that, in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration, a Liberal Party member should receive the endorsement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must be careful in our interpretation of the wish of the people expressed in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum that we keep the numbers of the party for which the electorate originally voted so as not to give an advantage to another party which was not elected by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  seemed to think his thoughts were quite irrevelant- that somehow the election of a successor to  Senator Hall  was related to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment which this Parliament and the people, adopted last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last few years we have found some weaknesses and obscurities in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must get on to these issues and try to find dialogue and solutions, whether through the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention or through our individual activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is the essence of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> contract that someone should be able to blow the whistle on the Executive and say in effect: ‘Hey, back to the people ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view whatever the man has done subsequently, in November 1975  Sir John  Kerr showed considerable courage and great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety in making the decision he did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to talk a little further about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is anything that is anathema to the independence of this chamber, to the separate existence of this chamber and to this chamber being able to fulfil its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role relating to the scrutiny of the Executive and ensuring the accountability of the Executive, if there is anything which could destroy that it is a system of joint committees where the Senate is the poor relation of the greater number in the House of Representatives, where we are taken on suffrage in some way to do the bidding of the House which represents the executive government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This 40 per cent of the people, including some of Australia ‘s leading <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and historians, saw through the plotting that was taking place between Kerr, Barwick and Fraser: They realised what was happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In full public eye, he accepted the big payoff, more than $70,000 a year plus benefits and the hardships of the post in Paris, a large income by any standards, but surely a cheap reward for dividing his nation, undermining the very fibre of Australian <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy and degrading the position of Head of State of the Australian Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Circumstances in the States come into this, and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position affects it as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least my experience was part of the catalyst which led to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in relation to casual vacancies in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change affected the length of tenure of office of  Senator Lewis  who was in the chamber at the time of the 1977 referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect, therefore,  Senator Lewis  was the first person to be directly affected by the 1977 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I would have thought that  Senator James  McClelland, as other members of the Australian Labor Party have done, was exposing the fact that through the actions of Kerr while he was the Governor-General of Australia the whole democratic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> parliamentary system was brought into contempt amongst a great many Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very circumstances called upon the South Australian Government to take note of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year when the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs was considering the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill the adviser to the Committee,  Mr P.  Waight, a recognised authority on evidence matters attached to the Law School of the Australian National University, wrote to the Committee on 26 October 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Michael Dixon, Secretary, Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his letter to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs,  Mr Waight  said:  it is generally said that there is only a rule against hearsay or secondary evidence (although in each case there are many exceptions to it) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important at this time of critical <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Northern Territory that we- my colleague,  Senator Kilgariff,  and I- should be responsible for putting in front of the Senate and the Government the needs and problems of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This process has begun, as may be seen in my Government’s reforms in the areas of taxation, social welfare and its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have given careful consideration to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis and have made some decisions which I wish to explain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been necessary for me to find a democratic and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> solution to the current crisis which will permit the people of Australia to decide as soon as possible what should be the outcome of the deadlock which developed over the supply between the two Houses of Parliament and between the Government and the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to refuse or defer supply to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Prime Minister refuses to resign or to advise an election, and this is the case with  Mr Whitlam,  my <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority and duty require me to do what I have now done- to withdraw his commission- and to invite the Leader of the Opposition to form a caretaker government- that is one that makes no appointments or dismissals and initiates no policies, until a general election is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in passing that I have a personal view that the life of the Parliament should be extended to four years and that it ought to be a mandatory term, although I recognise that for it to be made mandatory there are many very substantial <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems to be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obviously a matter which, although it is now under examination by a government committee, ought to go to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention to be examined by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an appropriate time for Australia to be looking to further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Colston  has said, that is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill was referred by the Senate to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which furnished a useful and constructive report to the Senate on 26 April 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommended that the Bill be amended to ensure that persons serving with the armed forces of a government or a force approved by the Minister pursuant to sub-clause 9(2) should not be liable to penalty for acts done during the course of their service with those forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of course, the messages concerning the appointment of members to this Committee and other such committees have always come from the House of Representatives after each House of Representatives election; but over at least the last 10 or 12 years my colleagues in this chamber have taken the view that the Senate is a House in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> life irrespective of the dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall when the present Government parties were in Opposition- those dark years- and a delegation went to the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, it was the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition congratulates the Minister first of all on having allowed that procedure to take place and, secondly, on the Government’s acceptance of the suggestions in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs of which I was  Chairman  considered this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly concur with  Senator Missen  that the manner in which this matter has been handled by the Senate as a whole- I think the present Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  deserves some credit for that- in agreeing to refer this vexed matter to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the manner in which the Committee dealt with the matter, are in the rather better traditions of the Senate ‘s conduct of its business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the Attorney for his consideration and the Government for its consideration of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I acknowledge with appreciation the consideration that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs gave to the Bill, limited as it was and handicapped by the fact that its decision had to precede consideration of my submission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was then considered by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs after the Committee of the Whole debate which resulted in the decision to refer the Bill to that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I apologise to members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for the way in which I rushed their consideration of this Bill when it was referred to them last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there are, in the first place, strong <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objections: military government of any kind is anathema to us, and we are all deeply aware of the tragic failure that the use of the Army in the policing role in Northern Ireland represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, these are areas over which the State governments have <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government should assume full legal, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and moral responsibilities so that the Aboriginal people in Queensland can be treated in the same way as they are in all of the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position in relation to the power of the Australian Government is clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms that issue has the recent support of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first year of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history of this country  Sir Edmund  Barton, the Prime Minister of Australia, wrote to the Queensland Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the ratio of Yes to No votes in Queensland was eight to one which is a pretty good indication that there is massive support in that State for the proposition that the Commonwealth has a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In common with a number of other members of this Parliament, I engaged last year in one of the exercises we have performed pursuant to our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They urge that the Federal Government take steps to prevent the actions of the Queensland Government in whatever way it possibly can- be it legally or constitutionallybecause they believe that the Federal Government not only has those legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights but also has a moral responsibility to support the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I urge the Federal Government- I would beg if necessary- to  exercise its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right under the terms of the 1967 referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1967 this Parliament was given the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to protect those people and to allow them to make their own decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament is honour bound to use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to make laws for the protection, peace, order and good government of the Aboriginal people in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the date for presenting the report of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the four matters- Processing law reform proposals; Delegation of parliamentary authority: Priority of Crown debts; and Parliamentary scrutiny of rules of court- be extended until 3 1 August 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one examines the report made by the Committee one will find that it went also into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation of that concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Territory which inquired into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Northern Territory called for discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, in relation to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Northern Territory- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to be able to quote that reference from the honourable member for the Northern Territory who sees the need for close consultation in all these matters relating to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been many <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes in the Northern Territory since 1947 when the Legislative Council was formed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These moves resulted in a further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changethe introduction of nominated members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report became the bible for further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change that produced a fully elected council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So this further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change to a fully elected council occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that I cannot claim to have the expertise of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, although I did spend many years on the bench as a cabinet maker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He referred to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to confine the payment of bounty to bountiable yarn spun in registered premises and the Minister’s power to register premises and in that way to select who is entitled to the bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this is one of the problems highlighted by the investigations being carried out at the moment by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, of which I am a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) A reference of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to the Commonwealth to enable it to confer jurisdiction on the Family Courts over children not covered by the Family Law Act necessarily depends entirely on the willingness of States to make such a reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments were made to the Family Law Act following the decision of the High Court in  Russell  v.  Russell  to bring it within the limits of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power as determined in that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of this Parliament to pass section 45D of the Trade Practices Act is an issue before the High Court and it has not yet been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I realise that there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) How many envelopes addressed ‘A message from the Minister for the Capital Territory’ and bearing the logo of the Australian Government Publishing Service, containing a letter dated 9 March 1978 and a document headed Proposed <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Development in the Australian Capital Territory’, have been posted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-49-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is carefully designed to achieve that result within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth, given by the 1967 referendum, to make special laws for the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> because of the referendum that was carried in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not stand here to expound <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are here promoting a unique <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> contest between State and Federal governments on the question of the control of two Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I do not recall that it embraced a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle, but do so on that basis and on that basis alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not remember any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue between State and Commonwealth giving rise to such an acute crisis since the Depression days when  Mr Lang  refused to pay moneys to the Commonwealth Government and the Federal Parliament put through garnishee proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like  Senator Wright,  I do not claim to be an expert on either the affairs of Aborigines or the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems of this country, but there are various aspects of the legislation and the manner in which it has been handled and brought to this Parliament which disturb me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright raised considerable doubts and objections to the legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects of the Bill, something which is beyond my capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that he has had some difficulty because of the lack of time and the need for advice to look at the legality and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That provision is in the Bill as an express saving of the right of the State to continue to carry out its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities in these areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright arrested our attention on a number of matters of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> concern and matters of legality which he raised in his speech last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I speak on behalf of the Government when I say that it would expect that after the third reading a Government senator would move that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for urgent investigation and consideration of many of the matters that have been raised, as well as any others which it saw fit to raise, and then report back to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In replying to the second reading debate, I indicate that after the third reading it is expected that the measure will be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am grateful to the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  for having indicated that if the Bill is passed she will accept a motion to refer this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for ex post facto examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the question of the true effect of this legislation not from the point of view of any legalistic or technical <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> contentions, all of which I disclaimed last night, but in accordance with proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principlenot specific <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are serious legal defects in the argument which, if allowed to be carried, would throw into jeopardy the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out to  Senator Gietzelt  and the Opposition that if we were to accept his amendments, in particular those in relation to reserves which seek to freeze the status of the land, they could raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties and invite a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change which could set aside the whole of the Bill now under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister must approve by-laws, and the application of by-laws to non-Aborigines, I am advised, could raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred earlier when speaking on this clause to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt that would be created about a Bill of this kind if it were to provide for people other than Aborigines and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice that the Government has is that it could raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt and a provision of this kind should not be believed necessary simply for the reasons expressed by  Senator Gietzelt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have to say that the real difficulty that the Government finds in accepting an amendment to remove sub-clause (9) is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt which it would raise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the fact that the Government acknowledges that the matter needs to be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is indicative of the existence within the legislation of certain deficiencies which need to receive further consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could be some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt about this matter and the second proposed sub-clause is unnecessary since the Aboriginal rights are already protected under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or any other reason why the majority of States cannot transfer such powers despite the obstruction of the Queensland Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to comment on proposed section 7 Q which is of some significance and which was suggested to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs by an adviser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation and the principles and structure of the legislation are consistent with the proper responsibilities of the Commonwealth; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether, in the opinion of the Committee, the sections of the legislation are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, comprehensive, consistent and effective, or whether any amendments should be made to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I am aware of the work of a number of committees, and particularly of the Committee to which I have asked that this matter be referred- the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister submitted that there was some legal doubt and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems associated with the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the motion moved by  Senator Bonner,  which is under consideration, states that we should look at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, comprehensive and consistent effectiveness of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not an indictment upon us and an indictment upon the framers of the notice of motion- I am referring to those who have the responsibility of preparing the notice of motionthat on the same day that we passed it, when it was part of our responsibility to review the legislation and make the essential remedies, if there were defects in it, notice was given of a motion to set up a committee of the Senate to study it, to see whether it is effective, to see whether it is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and to see whether it is comprehensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt that the States have certain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and certain capacities to be difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of  Senator Gietzelt’s  contention is centred around the fact that we want to send a Bill off to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill was sent off to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which recommended 120 amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that was the first point of great pressure and urgency on the Federal Government, to move to legislate to enable it to act on its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility in respect of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is some argument, I understand, about whether a select committee ought to be set up to look at the Bill or whether it would be better to send the Bill to a standing committee such as the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no ideal standing committee to which this matter could go except the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee which does have some natural advantages in that it has a secretariat and members who are used to looking at <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and examining them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So anybody from the Senate who is not a member of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee but who does have a keen interest in the subject can of course go along and participate in the proceedings of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee ought to take a close look at a very wide range of Queensland legislation to ascertain just how many pieces of legislation could possibly affect the welfare of Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference of this matter to a committee will in no way limit the rights of and opportunities for people to put submissions to the Committee and to say whatever they believe is relevant, particularly under paragraph (c) of the motion in respect of the constitutionality, comprehensiveness, consistency and effectiveness of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Indeed, it is even open to the Queensland Government, if it sees fit, and to any department under that Government, to put in submissions relating to the legislation and to say what they think about the constitutionality and so on of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be interesting to see whether they treat the Senate committee with that son of interest and respect and choose to put to the Parliament and to the Government via the Senate Committee their views on whether or not that legislation is really <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and properly consistent with the responsibilities of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt  has indicated the difficulties he sees the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee will have in reporting quickly in any event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has already stated publicly that if the proposed legislation and the lease arrangements which will be legislated for by the Queensland Government are not satisfactory to the Commonwealth, the Commonweatlh will use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of acquisition in order to ensure that the rights and interests of the people of the two communities are fully protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there does seem to be under section 51 ( 1 ) of the Constitution, as suggested by  Senator Tehan,  ample <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power for the Parliament to pass legislation in regard to conciliation procedures in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It certainly must be a very sad day for  Senator Bonner  and those other honourable senators on the Government side who took part in the debate on the matter of public importance on 1 5 March, who took part in the second reading and Committee stages of the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Bill and who supported a motion yesterday to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs all the matters that were raised in the Senate about the effectiveness of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before World War II Australia and other metropolitan powers performed administering functions in their respective South Pacific territories without any visible attitudes or programs aimed at change in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status of their territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, I seek leave to make a statement relating to consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs of the reference concerning the provisions of legislation empowering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to live on reserves in Queensland and to manage and control their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As Chairman of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, I wish to acquaint the Senate and all interested parties with the course of action which the Committee proposes to take in relation to its newly acquired reference on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the action of the Queensland Government in effectively abolishing the reserves at Aurukun and Mornington Island has had considerable impact on the effectiveness of the Commonwealth legislation, a number of cogent reasons were advanced for nevertheless referring it to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee met yesterday to discuss its role in the light of these developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with this complex reference the Committee accepts that its primary concern is the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal aspects of this matter rather than the difficult questions of social policy which arise in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lawyers can sort out whether the matter is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Commonwealth Government says that because it believes many functions can be done better at the State level or by co-operation, irrespective of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, there will be co-operative federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A question concerning section 45D is under <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780505_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the AttorneyGeneral aware that because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties Queensland could become a State without a properly elected government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, I look forward to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These shall also be furnished to the appropriate Minister of the Northern Territory, on or after 1 July 1 978, in line with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These discussions which are continuing have involved the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relations between the Commonwealth and the States and the Commonwealth’s international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-46-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Basis’ the paper states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of any State Government being unwilling or unable to adequately guarantee the rights of the Aboriginal and Islander peoples to self-determination, the Australian Government should not hesitate to use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers in the manner and to the extent desired by those peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If agreement cannot be reached to these vital questions, the Commonwealth will have to use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power including the power to acquire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth Government is not satisfied with the terms of both the local government legislation and the leases, it will exercise its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to acquire land in the interests of the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said and said again that if at the end of all of this discussion and consultation the Commonwealth Government is not satisfied with the tern  i  of the legislation and of the leases it will exercise its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to acquire land in the interests of the Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to each point in the Minister’s speech she said that the Commonwealth will consult with the communities and, if the communities do not agree, the Government will use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and acquire land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out to  Senator Gietzelt  and the Opposition that if we were to accept his amendments, in particular those in relation to reserves which seek to freeze the status of the land, they could raise <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties and invite a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change which could set aside the whole of Bill now under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not being a legal man like  Senator Missen,  I could not argue the legal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> act can be made unconstitutional by changing a date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the legal luminaries say that a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> act can be made unconstitutional by changing a date? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suppose that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs can determine this matter by expressing an opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said the Commonwealth recognised its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations, ‘ and we expect to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But from the Commonwealth’s point of view, looking at its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations, we have to decide on the basis of the work that’s been done over the weekend- the various options that will be put before Cabinet- just what ought to be done to bring the matter to finality, and finality in the interests of the people ‘, he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  raised the question of whether this is constitutionally possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right, what are the other problems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aurukun leaders have told my Committee- the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- which is looking into the existing legislation, that this is something which worries them very considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs is pledged to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality of new federalism in operation, as we all know now, is that if the Premier of Queensland stands the Federal Government up on a particular matter in which the Government has not only <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power but also <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations- like the question of Aurukun and Mornington Island- then the Government goes to water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Bill adopts a recommendation of the Fox report by extending the power of the Minister to exercise control not only for defence purposes but also for all proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would seem to be little doubt that the Commonwealth has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to assume full control for all proper purposes, and we suggest that consideration should be given to its doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see that we are expanding our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> base from the defence area into the area of power relating to trade and, of course, to external affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not care that the Marcos regime, with which it is making bilateral arrangements, has already demonstrated total disregard not only for the protests of people of the Philippines who live near the reactor site but also for the democratic and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights of the entire population of that nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In none of the documents that have been produced in relation to this matter is the slightest reference made to the report of the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review which met between 1956 and 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect we recommended that the Commonwealth Parliament should be empowered by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to make laws with respect to: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Government senators in their speeches have not even referred to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, I shall refer to the question of power as it was raised in the Fox report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would seem to be little doubt that the Commonwealth has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to assume full control for all proper purposes, and we suggest that consideration should be given to its doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am dismayed to think that in this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> menage we have a structure that is so indefinite as to the degree to which it depends on the States that it suggests that the code will be referred to the States, but insofar as their laws do not provide properly for the code, the Commonwealth takes power under the Bill to add to the legislation and supplement it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a remarkably brief period at the Victorian Bar in which his practice ranged over industrial, common and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, Menzies built a formidable name as a brilliant legal intellect and an outstanding advocate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that historic achievement in which he successfully stood alone against several notable King ‘s Counsel he appeared in many famous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases before the High Court and the Privy Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This outstanding <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer had few rivals and in 1929, at the age of 34, he became Australia’s youngest King’s Counsel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He saw clearly the place of the Crown in the Australian body politic, and stood by the principles of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchy which are the fundamental base of our political life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case you put in the Senate about the effect of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposals on the position of the Senate was unanswerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the agreement, if the Commonwealth is not satisfied with the terms of both the local government legislation and the leases it will exercise its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to acquire land in the interests of the Aborigines, but it has been agreed by everybody that there ought to be a testing period to see whether this legislation will work and will achieve for the Aborigines the degree of self-management which will enable them to determine their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would need our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some doubts about the legislation and that is why I want the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to look into the question of how far our right to acquire land for Aboriginal settlement extends and whether or not that power was given to the Commonwealth Government in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the particular interests identified with  Sir Robert  Menzies and with which might therefore be drawn within the purposes of the fund are the law, with particular reference to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters and Federal-State relationships, studies concerned with Australia’s role within the British Commonwealth and with AustraliaBritain relations, studies of Australia and the United States, studies of relations between Australia and the Pacific Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former raises jurisdictional issues with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even setting this aside the Bills have wider <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects that require consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to his doubt as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power on which the whole of this legislation is based and said that there had been failure to obtain by agreement with the States a very firm <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the important recommendations of that Committee was that the Commonwealth Parliament should be empowered by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to make laws with respect, firstly, to the manufacture of nuclear fuels and the generation and use of nuclear energy and, secondly, to ionising radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power is linked very much to the attitude of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed his doubts about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> basis of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, we are in a somewhat unsatisfactory situation where we have this opinion of the States and the very doubtful <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power upon which the legislation is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory, I am sure all honourable senators will agree that these are all very proper and responsible proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and arises from an item in this morning’s  Canberra Times  which gives the names of the delegates from the Senate to the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My understanding of what happened is that yesterday in another place the Prime Minister put down a statement about the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and gave the names of the Commonwealth delegates to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I recall reports such as the 1958 report of the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate agrees that the Commonwealth Parliament participate with the Parliaments of the States in the continuing work of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention established to review the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution and accordingly resolves: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next plenary session of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is scheduled to be held at Parliament House in Perth over the three-day period 26 to 28 July 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s view is that it is desirable that at least one more plenary session of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is held so that the continuing work of the Convention in reviewing the operation of the Australian Constitution may proceed further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the original impetus for the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention came from  Sir Henry  Bolte ‘s Liberal Government in Victoria and, particularly at the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we can all recall with some satisfaction the overwhelming approval given by the Australian electorate in May of last year to three referendum proposals, each of which had first been approved in principle at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Convention provides a unique forum for discussion of fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to the Senate this motion which seeks to ratify the continued participation of this Parliament in the endeavours of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the composition of the Commonwealth delegation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Conventions in those years, the relevant Journals of the Senate reveal that a much more democratic attitude was adopted than the one adopted in the present Government’s motion, which I gather has the tacit approval of the present Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I contend that a delegation of Commonwealth parliamentarians to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention is to the general public in the long run of even greater importance than a Senate committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate rejects the idea of having delegates from non-Labor and non-Coalition parties at the Convention it will be doing a disservice to genuine <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware from reading the  Canberra Times  this morning that I am indulging in a somewhat futile exercise at the moment, as it would appear that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has already decided not only what parties but also what members will be represented at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Opposition welcomes the statement made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  in relation to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall the Press discussion on the policies of the Australian Democrats at the last election, it was to the effect that the Australian Democrats had no policy, particularly in relation to matters such as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could scarcely say that Australian Democrats come here with a mandate- if one can use that expression- on the basis that they have shown an interest in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform, because that is not so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I alert him now, if I may, both in his capacity as a delegate and as Minister for Administrative Services, to the fact that that presents a problem for the Opposition in the Senate in view of the fact that senators will be retiring from this Parliament on 30 June and we will have at least three new senators here, some of whom might both desire to attend and be appropriate persons to attend the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, we have not yet seen an agenda for the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today in the Senate I referred to the report of the Fifty-eighth <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention ought to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention meeting again in plenary session after the Perth meeting if it is not to be a meaningful convention which discusses questions of fundamental importance to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I hope will happen is that in July when the Australian Democrats come here in their full glory- I do not wish to detract from  Senator Haines  at all- they will argue the case for a popular convention to consider <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues and not just for a convention which is confined to the sort of grey bureaucrats of politics, such as the Minister and I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that because it is a meaningful convention it will not be the last convention and that the subject of desirable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reforms will continually be brought forward and debated in this country as an issue of national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  also raised a problem with respect to a senator who will retire on 30 June being appointed a member of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are at least two senators coming into this place next July who are lawyers and who would be appropriate people to attend the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives acquainting the Senate of a resolution agreed to yesterday relating to the participation by the House in the continuing work of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties but surely the first approach to the States should be one of consultation first to see whether they will agree to give the Commonwealth powers in relation to this matter and secondly whether they agree to a uniform code. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officials indicated that the States saw these particular Bills as raising the possibility of Commonwealth intrusion into areas of State responsibilities in respect of uranium mining and nuclear energy, that the Bills were seen as being of doubtful <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity, that their passage raised the issue of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> impropriety with the Commonwealth resiling from its cooperative federalism policy, and that the Bills lacked specific arrangements for Commonwealth/State consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important to understand- and I do not seek to be vexatious in any way- that the States are saying that there is some question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must concedeperhaps even more readily than did the Ministerthat there are problems of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power for the Commonwealth Government in dealing with this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find it extraordinaryI think  Senator Wriedt  touched on this point- that, in the process of consultation which the Minister says he has had, it never occured to the Commonwealth Government to advert to the weakness of its own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power until it was pointed out by a State Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 take it from what the Minister has said and from what  Senator Button  has said that there is some doubt about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is felt that the Commonwealth is on more solid <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I admit that I am not a legal man, these provisions may be necessary in accordance with <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights, but if they are necessary we have to admit that the Commonwealth Government cannot protect the environment from uranium mining unless we first get a uniform code of agreement which all States will observe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond any doubt at all it has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to ensure that, and it will not occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because there is some worry about where <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers lie in Australia we will do this as far as possible by complementary legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition itself has indicated that there is without any doubt some lack of assurance throughout Australia regarding the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> heads of power as to the Government’s capacity to enforce totally its laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am always delighted when  Senator Button  gives me a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lecture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him rely on the absolute security of his vast ignorance on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law because I am sure that that is a comfortable thing, and I say that happily in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen in the last few weeks that the Commonwealth Government has not only a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right, as it has in relation to the granting of export licences, but also a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> duty and obligation to make laws with respect to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In the second reading debate I likewise expressed concern about the dubious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and the fact that that matter had not been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are trying to do now is to have each State amend its legislation, where necessary, so that any possible defect in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of this country can be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The purpose of the insertion of new Part IVa relates in a sense to a judicial and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> point which is simply this: Assuming the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 is passed and proclaimed, the Commonwealth Government will be given paramount rights over the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of challenging the validity of regulations, the States or anyone else, provided they could establish standing, could challenge the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This assumes their constitutionality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The requirement is not due to any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions but rather to a general order of the Commonwealth Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most salient feature in regard to State elections is that in all States except South Australia no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements necessitate State public servants to resign to contest a State election in their own State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate on the introduction of the Crown Employees Bill into the Queensland Parliament in October 1958 there was discussion about whether the Bill would be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> if the right of reappointment was included in its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removal of this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement would allow public servants the same basic freedom to nominate for political office as is enjoyed by other Australian adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change is made, it may still be necessary to alter some existing legislation or regulations which unnecessarily fetter the rights of public servants to stand for election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that senators and members who are interested in this question will provide me with their comments on my suggestion of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention was excited in a very keen way by a proposal concerning the former Governor-General,  Sir John  Kerr, already by special Act of this Parliament in receipt of an ex-Governor-General ‘s salary equivalent to the retiring salary of a Chief Justiceby the way, I had the honour to contribute two vital objections to it when we voted on itbecause he had taken a notable and distinguished, and probably an epoch-making decision in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of this country to the great satisfaction of the Australian people who registered their approval of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) It is a fundamental right of the House to legislate on any matter within <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-What did they do when they were forced by the epoch-making decision of a great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> exponent, John Kerr, to submit themselves to the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it was made clear that the Australian Government, while it recognised the desirability of further investment in newsprint production being located where it would make the best use of the combined resources of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Area, had no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority to influence the location or nature of such further investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not certain whether this matter is on the agenda or ever has been raised for consideration at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should it ever make such a policy decision, I would imagine that it would do so on the basis of its being referred to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention for comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their thinking was that the purpose of civilised democratic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in countries such as Britain was to carry on the traditions which had been established by the glorious Whig revolution of 1688, to take by gradual <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means with the consent of the electors steps towards a state of society in which, whether the means of production were publicly or privately owned, at least there was, as far as one could possibly achieve these means by legislative action, equality of opportunity amongst all of the people to live in England, which was the country with which they were dealing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Churchill was saying that it was because there was a secure and ordered <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government that one person was able to pass on to his successor the fruits of his labour or the fruits of what he had inherited from somebody else’s labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I sought the adjournment of the debate so that we could give further consideration to the position of this chamber and the position of the Commonwealth generally in relation to this <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which has been proceeding now for nearly six years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the reasons for this is that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is basically representative of the executives of the governments of Australia and the executives of the oppositions of Australia and is not representative of the parliaments of Australia, nor of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the total federal compact which was arrived at as a result of the numerous <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions of the 1880s and 1890s which led to federation, this chamber was created as an equal House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The troubles we have, which are fundamental, with our Constitution in practice are because executive power has been permitted to override <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangement was that we had two equal Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we come to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention we find that this House has six representatives and the House of Representatives has 10 representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if we have delegates to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention representing the executive governments of the houses of parliament of the various States of Australia, what we will have is discussion which takes place on the basis of what is most convenient for an executive government rather than what is in the best interests of democracy and federalism in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the fiasco of the referendum last year- it was a most unfortunate fiasco- is the best demonstration I can produce of why we ought to be cautious about how we approach the next <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and any which are held thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thank God for the futureology which was displayed by those people who attended the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions of the 1880s and the 1890s’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention must remember is that a great Australia will depend upon the whole of Australia, not just Melbourne and Sydney; not the mob of people who are living on protection, on the well-being and the resources developed by the producer States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is important to bear this in mind when we are talking about the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, when we are talking about safeguards, when we are talking about the role of the Senate, when we are talking about the Senate as a States House, when we are talking about the compact that was originally agreed to when people surrendered their rights to be independent and were brought together as one Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to suggest, for instance, that honourable senators ensure that this chamber receives a better and more adequate representation at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which is a meeting of the executive nominees of the various government of Australia, a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which virtually disregards one of the equal Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth is a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which we should support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is a necessity for a little consideration to be given, even to some of the principles for an elected <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That does not mean that they have an absolute right to nominate who shall go to a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, who shall participate in it and who shall express views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that whilst we have an opportunity to discuss this <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention we ought to give some thought to what it means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That reminds me of the fact that only 1,500 words were expressed on the most controversial matter in the last four referendum proposals dealt with at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Hobart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that that is not a good enough approach to the question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought this was an encouraging sign from the point of view of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the arguments in relation to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform have tended to be negative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have said that there is no point in putting up proposals for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform because people will not vote for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes us believe that it is worthwhile looking to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention which represents the people from all the States and from the various Houses of the Parliaments of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the people who think that the future of Australia is to be found in the featherbedded areas I can only say: ‘Come on the next <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> convention when there will be an opportunity for those who have been producing and working to talk, to ensure that the compact agreed to originally is not destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are talking about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions, about a States house having inadequate representation out of the total Commonwealth parliamentary representation, and about what changes we ought to be making to the Constitution, I ask people to bear in mind that it is not unreal to suggest that many parts of Australia would be better off to go it alone than they would be to succumb to being ridden over by a feather-bedded majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although there are some aspects of what he said with which I am afraid I cannot agree, I find a great deal of support for him in a number of propositions which he has made concerning the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention and our representation at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might even say: Look at the record on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that that is not a wonderful record in regard to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in the future we will see a lot more support for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying - I am agreeing strongly with  Senator Rae-  that a popularly elected convention would bring a great deal more knowledge of and concern for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that if we moved now to an elected convention where people had to choose delegates and had to think whether those people would be the most suitable persons to be delegates at a convention for the purpose of looking at a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change, I believe we would have a better understanding of the proposals that are put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably there would be much more interest taken by the public, Press and others in the workings of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention than is taken at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has too much of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> flavour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While supporting this motion, nonetheless we ought to recognise the thin nature of the popular support for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, we are in agreement upon the essential importance of the Senate of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change and on the need for greater knowledge and deep understanding of it, and on the need for a democratically elected convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that my own colleagues have raised a number of matters concerning the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the quality of the senators at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention far outweighs the numerical strength they will bring to bear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows that there is more goodwill about for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform than some people imagine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention is a method of getting the Commonwealth Parliament, which is the lone initiator of referendum proposals, to put certain things to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, we still rely on quality from Western Australia because, like going to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention, we might not have the numbers but we have the quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the State governments, acting under their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, have set up a series of committees to look at post-secondary education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal principle involved, since the change will make practice in this matter consistent with that in other situations where the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present the report and evidence from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the priority of Crown debts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Opposition senators who are on the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs associate themselves with the remarks made by  Senator Missen  in bringing down this report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the arrangements should be free of any significant <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or other legal doubt; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has disagreed with his Party on matters so diverse as life insurance; land tax; civil aviation; matters affecting the sugar, wool, meat and wheat industries; on parliamentary retiring allowances in both 1955 and 1959; on parliamentary allowances in 1959 and 1967; on the stevedoring industry; on tariffs and customs; on matrimonial causes; on broadcasting and television; on the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act; on trade practices; on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> alteration and on many other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is likely to be the normal situation now under the new <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements is that the elections of the Senate and the House of Representatives will be held simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to speak at any length  on  this matter at the moment except to commend the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on his report on a very significant matter which has been occasioning concern for a great many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received letters from the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  (Senator Wriedt)  requesting that Senators Button, Devitt, Tehan and Wheeldon be discharged from further service on the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and nominating Senators Cavanagh, Keeffe, Lewis and O’Byrne to be members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Senators Button, Devitt, Tehan and Wheeldon be discharged from further service on the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and that Senators Cavanagh, Keeffe, Lewis and O’Byrne, having been duly nominated in accordance with Standing Order 36AA be appointed members of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir REGINALD WRIGHT (Tasmania) (4.21)- There are two matters that I would have wished the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  to be present to deal with personally because, without any reflection upon  Senator Guilfoyle  whose presence is always welcomed, there are two matters that were raised in Committee that I think are of fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our Parliament it is a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement for validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir REGINALD WRIGHT (Tasmania) (9.18)- I will not speak unless the Senate is in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a very real sense, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history of the Northern Territory since that date reflects the endeavours of the people of the Territory to regain the rights which they lost in 1 9 10. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there can be little doubt that, while not conferring statehood, the Bill now before the House will, when enacted, represent the most significant advance to date in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill now before the Senate represents in a very real sense, a continuation of the endeavours of honourable members and senators on both sides of the Parliament to meet the legitimate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspirations of the Northern Territory community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As is appropriate in a measure of this type, the Bill commences with a preambular statement of the intention of the Parliament and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority for giving effect to that intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The miscellaneous provisions in Part VI cover a series of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>-type guarantees in relations to the freedom of trade and the acquisition of property on just terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be inappropriate for me to let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the people who, over the years, have made a significant contribution to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are people who, while holding divergent political views, have been united and tireless in working and pressing the case for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The additional amount would be allocated across the board on a uniform basis, in accordance with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements that bounties be uniform across Australia, to those factories which wished to receive an increased quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) the Northern Territory (Self Government) Bill 1978 should not be passed until a plebiscite has shown that voters in the Northern Territory approve the financial and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions due to take effect on 1 July 1978; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The financial implications of the Territory’s moves towards self-government are the least understood area of the current historic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill the Administrator- and no doubt some of the lawyers who may speak to this legislation will have some comments to makeseems to have undue <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I must say that in the last year or two, although Opposition members have indicated in a manner their support for these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes, they have been party to a continual questioning and erosion process which I do not think helps the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to retrace briefly the steps of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can best describe this most important <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change over the years as the political pioneering of the Northern Territory, lt has indeed been an extremely hard road. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can learn from the history of these pioneering giants who did so much for the Territory in those days, the various ways in which they produced, by continual battling with the Federal Government, a situation in which their rights were recognised and by degrees, they enjoyed increasing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1959 there was a further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the strength of their representation and their voice that echoed throughout Australia there were, by degrees, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an odd situation but, thank goodness, that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change did not last for long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the least I should do is perhaps to name one or two of the people who I consider to be political giants- people who have endeavoured to make history and who have helped the Northen Territory achieve this important milestone in its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Bill 1978 should not be passed until a plebiscite has shown that voters in the Northern Territory approve the financial and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions due to take effect on 1 July 1 978 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am vitally concerned with this legislation dealing with selfgovernment for the Northern Territory, because I was one of the members of the Committee which was set up by the Whitlam Government immediately after our election to government in 1972, to look at and report on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I was a member of the committee which inquired into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that I was a member of the committee, chaired by Bert James, which was set up by the Whitlam Government to look into the question of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill has been produced in an unnecessarily confidential or secretive manner, which has prevented the Government from having the benefit of the kind of wide-ranging discussions that are desirable in areas of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that the Senate, particularly Territory representatives, would consider whether there should be reference to a Senate committee of the question of further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development- with a view to ensuring a public avenue of debate and consultation that can be used in the Northern Territory by the Opposition, by the majority party, by the public and by all interested parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He can point out <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> weaknesses, but in the final analysis, it is my contention and the thrust of our argument, he must take the advice of the elected representatives of the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need for five separate Acts arises from a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that laws imposing taxes should deal with one subject of taxation only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a good deal in common in freedom of information laws in other countries in the kinds of information protected from mandatory disclosure, notwithstanding differences in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and administrative structures within which those laws operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government is confident that it has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, through its taxing powers and so on, to make this legislation operative or to achieve the purposes sought by this legislation, why did the Minister go on to talk about the Commonwealth having recourse to section 96 grants if any State really wanted to play it tough? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is nice to remember that having been on the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review Committee with a dissenting report in favour of maintenance of the Senate powers, in the only three referenda that have been put forward on this matter either by my side or by the Opposition, the majority of the Australian people, according to the Constitution, have not accepted the view that was put that the Senate power should be eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose one of the lighter experiences I enjoyed was to go to lunch at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee and listen to two other lawyers-  Senator Chaney  and  Senator Wheeldon-  exchanging repartee, embellished by comments from  Senator Button  and  Senator Missen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did the Minister refuse, on 8 September 1977, to make public a report of the interdepartmental committee established to advise the Government on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, financial and administrative issues associated with the transfer of executive responsibility to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly; if so, why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In response to a request from  Mr J.  McMillan, Lecturer in Law at the University of New South Wales, on 15 August 1977 for access to the report, I advised  Mr McMillan  on 8 September that I would not release the report of the interdepartmental committee established to advise the Government on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, financial and administrative issues associated with the transfer of executive responsibility to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly because its contents were very much in the nature of policy advice proffered to the Government for its deliberation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: The desirability and practicability of consulting the Australian people on whether or not they wish to have the right to initiate Federal legislation, with particular reference to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the possible reference of the question to a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention of which half the membership would be members of the public and the other half would be members of Parliament, elected by both Houses, at a Joint Sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is carefully designed to achieve that result with a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Commonwealth, given by the 1 967 referendum, to make special laws for the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is suggesting is that under the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> powers which were obtained in 1967 there should be legislation by the Commonwealth to take over the land constituting the local government areas which formerly were reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My criticism would simply be that I believe that point of view underrates both the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> complexities and the community problems that we face in this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event I think it was  Senator Durack  who, as the Minister in charge of the Bill, agreed to send it off to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was able to consider the Bill in the quieter circumstances of a committee meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may refer to the committee of which I am Chairman, the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, it often has been very valuable to that Committee to have a qualified lawyer, a lecturer in law or someone like that - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, when the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs did a reference on the Evidence Act in the Australian Capital Territory the lecturer in law at the Australian National University was there and discussed various clauses, made suggestions, did some drafting and came up with proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arguments have been raised at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before that, the Family Law Bill had been examined by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs as part of its examination of the reference on the then existing divorce law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was 10 years after the Matrimonial Causes Act commenced that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs was given the reference on the state of the divorce law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who  were associated with the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs at the time it dealt with the family law legislation when it was before the Senate will recall that many of the issues which now re-emerge in the terms of reference of the select committee were gone over fairly thoroughly by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a matter of regret that because the family law legislation was not voted on along party lines in the Senate the Government did not see fit to consult with the Opposition regarding the terms of reference of this joint select committee which, as I said, canvasses much the same grounds as the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee canvassed in 1974 and 1975 and indeed members of this Senate canvassed in the debate that took place when the legislation was considered on totally non-party lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make one other comment: That relates to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties which have occurred since the Family Law Bill became law, particularly those which have occurred in relation to custody and maintenance matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were adverted to by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> hang-ups which loomed large in the minds of Government senators it was not possible for them to agree with that view at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of the matters which will now be included in the terms of reference arise as a result of a failure to grapple with those issues in 1 975 either in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> terms or by means of seeking agreement between the States on the referral of certain powers to the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Pacific Commission, as the delegation discovered, faces some increasing problems because as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> process has continued in the South Pacific the role of the Commission has tended to be questioned in some respects by the emerging countries of the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two other small but, in the South Pacific context, important countries that we visited have recently been going through the process of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change and facing all the difficulties that go with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Committee has in its report very properly drawn attention to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development of the South Pacific nations and has reminded us all of the very many problems, opportunities, circumstances and relationships that closer contacts with external countries have yielded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, there is obviously a need to reorder the position on offences at sea as soon as possible, and in that regard for this Parliament to deal with those cases that come under the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Freedom of Information Bill 1 978 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should this matter now, in 1 978, be referred to the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a valid criticism of the Bill and one which justifies referring this legislation to the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to that statement because that is the nub of what we are saying in seeking to have this matter referred to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-It is with no little trepidation that I rise for the first time to address this House, given the frequency and vigour with which in the past, wearing a variety of academic and lawyerly hats, 1 have expressed my views as to its undemocratic character, its irresponsible conduct and its insupportable delusions of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> grandeur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take this opportunity to place on record my unshakeable determination- along with that of my Labor Party colleagues- to ensure that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> outrages of 1974 and 1975 are never again repeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was accepted that in order to enable the Government of the day to fulfil the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements imposed, this method of accounting should be adopted and was recognised as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I stress again for the record this year that there is no intention, nor would there be even if we were able, on the part of the Opposition to delay, much less to reject, this Bill because we stand on the principle, spelt out very ably by  Senator McAuliffe  in his contribution, that this is legislation which over the years has been accepted as normal Government accounting procedure to meet the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course I am no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> expert but recently something occurred to me in Queensland and my attention was attracted to this section by the counsel whom I engaged to defend me on the charge that was brought against me by the Queensland Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want someone on one of our committees, perhaps the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, to take a look at this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposal on simultaneous elections that was put to the people last year, and rejected by them then, was produced by the Joint Select Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review in 1959 and was endorsed by the 1976 Hobart <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All that would be needed would be to have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision that if a government could not be formed in the House of Representatives there should be an election for a new House of Representatives to complete the unexpired portion of the fixed term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal author of the Constitution, Griffith, was clearly of the opinion that the logical inconsistency would work itself out in practice, presumably through <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Deakin summed it up very well at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention 80 years ago when he said: The contest will not be, never has been and cannot be between States and States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this were to happen, the Senate would lack power and credibility and its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> roles would be emasculated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Increases in compensation payments to injured employees and to survivors of deceased employees when the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties occurred during 1975 were deferred and were not in fact approved until a year later in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To wind up, the last point that I make is this: The outburst of the Premier was not just intemperate, illogical and wrong headed- indeed extraordinarily so given the position and status which he occupies in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> systembut it also raises, I would suggest, quite serious questions about the privileges of the members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am of the belief that the legal advisers to the Government and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs also may have some doubts as to whether the Commonwealth has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to take over land for Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many legal authorities whom we could accept as <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities have expressed this doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was fortunate in the short time that I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to get, without a meeting having been held, a report from Professor Colin Howard, the Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Melbourne on the paper he gave to  Mr Justice  Kirby, the  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission, on the question of Aboriginal law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that so far it is a privileged document, although it was given to the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee with the approval of Professor Howard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I came back with the question of whether <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law could be declared to be unconstitutional because of a change in date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until 1967 that was the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was claimed that this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision discriminated against Aborigines insofar as the same laws could not apply to them as applied to other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two ways to legislate when there is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Opposition associates itself with the conclusions and the general tone of this report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the priority of Crown debts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which I have had the pleasure of perusing as a senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which we are now discussing is not perhaps of the same substance as the one discussed previously tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs deals with the routine work of the Senate committees, as do the reports of  Senator Jessop  ‘s Committee and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all might I say how interested I was in what my colleague,  Senator Missen,  said about the determinations of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, of which he is  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a very real sense, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> history of the Northern Territory since that date reflects the endeavours of the people of the Territory to regain the rights which they lost in 1910’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time the relationship of the Administator to the Commonwealth minister has been legislatively prescribed, and as legislative institutions were established as I have related, the Administrator’s place within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> structure changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though I claim to be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer, I should, as I said I would, exercise decent restraint in narrating this history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have recited the bare bones; it is necessary to an understanding of the significance of the events which have led to the establishment of this new <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it was fitting that the Commonwealth Minister in his speech on the second reading of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Bill should have pointed out that successive federal governments of differing complexion have promoted the development and changing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for water matters rests almost entirely with the respective States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee is of the opinion that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role should be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The actual form of it has been dictated by Standing Orders and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion is taken pretty much from the Australian Democrats draft policy on electoral and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it can make whatever arrangements, for better or worse, that it so desires under its own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1977, the clauses of that Bill were referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs when the Bill was being considered in Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those matters are squarely within the present reference of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in relation to the delegation of parliamentary authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third aspect of this item is a question related to the regulation-making powers which seem to come very much within the province of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, which is presently looking into a reference relating to the scrutiny of Bills before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Committee has done is to raise these three questions and to propose in its report that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs may, in examining its particular references, look at these items. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court should be free to concentrate on its role as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and appellate court in matters of general importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus in some cases where a statute now confers a right to proceed against the Commonwealth in the High Court, repeal of the statutory provision would still leave intact the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> jurisdiction of the High Court in matters in which the Commonwealth is suing or being sued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in line with the policy of giving Territory Supreme Courts, within <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limits, a status equal to that of State Supreme Courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also remind the Senate that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, admittedly before the legislation was adopted, took a very wide-ranging series of viewpoints and assessments from a vast range of groups in this community on what the effects of this legislation would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until recently, it has been generally accepted that the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to legislate in respect of trade marks did not extend to marks used in relation to services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave-I said as much as I had to say and as much as I believe that it is really appropriate to say when I moved the motion that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Archives Bill 1978 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible, in so far as the Bill relates to issues common to or related to the inquiry into the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason it is felt appropriate that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs should examine that Bill at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I envisage that the major inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs would be directed towards the provisions of the freedom of information legislation, and it may be that after the members of the Committee determine what principles they think should apply in relation to that legislation they could as a more supplementary matter examine the terms of the Archives Bill to see whether they think that those principles are appropriate for application to legislation of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the point of view of the Committee it might be quite a small reference and it may be that from time to time the Standing Committee on Education and the Arts would want to consult with the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs about the matters which it is considering in relation to the Archives Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will not oppose the motion as amended now by  Senator Button  to refer the Freedom of Information Bill and the Archives Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  has made out a case for the reference of the Freedom of Information Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  am not a member of the standing committee of the Senate which will examine the legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs will examine that exemption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs examine the reservations as expressed by Professor Shaw and take account of them when reviewing the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs I believe that I represent the views of members of the Committee when I say we welcome the motion to refer these two Bills to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I hope the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee would expect to do would be to conduct the most thorough and extensive inquiry that has ever been carried out by a Senate committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I support the reference of the Freedom of Information Bill and the associated Archives Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Affairs, of which I am a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, whilst it does contain among its members, including especially  Senator Missen  and myself, senators who have been publicly and vigorously critical of the Bill as it stands, will approach this Bill constructively and with a full appreciation of the difficulties and sensitivities that are involved in meshing it in with our system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, speaking on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, I look forward to co-operation and conversation with the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have absolute confidence that  Senator Evans,  as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, will discharge his obligations in an impartial way and will be, as indeed he always is, open to persuasion in relation to the issues and the evidence which will come before the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure, in all charity, that  Senator Lewis  has gone back to his room to prepare a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs about the issues involved in this debate on the freedom of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite recent history, I remain unconcerned with the controversies surrounding the existence and acceptance of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out by others on more than one occasion, we in the Senate provide one of the more important checks and balances within our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> obligations can be further strengthened, by developing the Senate ‘s other powers of scrutiny and review of federal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While not being unreasonably resistant to change, we owe it to future generations to examine carefully proposals which may be said to alter our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights and objectives in the name of ‘progress’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope at some appropriate time that we can give further consideration to the question of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although those developments did not originally have the force of law, the decree of 1972 to which I have referred was in fact adopted very briskly thereafter as guidelines by the respective State and Federal bureaucracies in West Germany and received the imprimatur of the West German Supreme <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Court in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties as well in this area and the solution to the problem has escaped the large number of people who have been looking at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many things wrong with this approach, quite apart from the fact that we probably have not the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to do anything effective about it anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power over exports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I particularly wish to refer to the Honourable  Sir Reginald  Wright who, for 29 years, untiringly fought to uphold legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> propriety and sought to maintain the Senate as a strict House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He attributed to the Assembly a capacity, a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, beyond its constituted limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out in regard to this tremendously important question of the respect that should be paid to the Assembly’s view that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs had to consider this type of problem when it dealt with the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of self-government or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development in the Capital Territory is to be decided by the people of the Capital Territory by the most democratic possible means- a referendum- on 25 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Whitlam Government was in office, I was part of a joint parliamentary committee which undertook an inquiry into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We decided- the Government accepted our report- that there should be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter relates to the provision by the Government to Australian university law schools of transcripts of argument in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases which was raised at that stage of the Committee’s hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, the situation is that back in July 1975 the then Labor Attorney-General,  Mr Enderby,  approved the supply to university law schools of such transcript of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The order of magnitude that we are talking about is transcript for some 10 or 12 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases, because that is all that are, being heard per annum by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have, of course, listened on two occasions to the views of  Senator Evans  on the question of the provision of transcripts of arguments in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the interest in the River Murray originated as far back as the 1890s in the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which dealt more with trade and shipping on the river than with the water itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not of course overcome the fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem in that even though the Commission may take into account the quality of water, the question remains of how a commission of this kind can enforce regulations over such matters when the powers still remain with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will steps be taken to amend the Constitution to enable the Court to give advisory opinions, as was strongly suggested at the recent <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-54-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if he moved a motion- he is indicating by nodding his head that he would do so if it were not for the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> restrictions- requesting additional funds for this road, it would become quite clear that what we were asking for, if the motion were accepted, was an additional allocation in the Budget; in other words, either for a greater Budget deficit or for the imposition of more taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst  Senator Bishop  under our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> restrictions could not have moved a motion requesting an alteration to the appropriation, he could have moved a request that an additional appropriation for the purpose of building the Stuart Highway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff  would know about that, because he gave evidence before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Reform for the Northern Territory, of which I was a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now being closely studied by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee will thus be making recommendations directly relevant to the future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status of the Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Foot and Mouth Disease Act 1961 provided also for payment of compensation to stockowners in the Northern Territory, but the present Bill reflects the recent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> developments in the Northern Territory and thus relates only to the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It brings it into line with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> legal status that it has of being on a par with the taking of an oath. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court building will be one of the most significant National buildings in Australia befitting the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present two reports from the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on scrutiny of Bills and delegation of parliamentary authority respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nor is there any legal limit on Parliament’s power to confer administrative authority, and other forms of power short of legislative power, provided that such conferring is otherwise within the Commonwealth’s range of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not wish  Senator Missen  ‘s reference to the legal input of  Senator Tate  and myself- we are both, after all, lawyers and, what is worse, <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyers and even worse still, former academic lawyers- to mislead anyone into thinking that these reports are just a lawyer’s exercise of the usual exotic, technical and, for the most part, unintelligible kind to which lawyers are prone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my hope, and the hope of all the Committee members, that the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for the establishment of a joint committee on the scrutiny of Bills will be adopted by this Parliament and that in due course, just as with the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, it will become a model that will be equally widely praised and adopted throughout the Westminster parliamentary world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate does not need me or the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to tell it what an unhappy chain of backsliding has been involved in the Commonwealth’s dealings with the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities over the last few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the very existence of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers to act in this area has been called into question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That power was conferred upon the Commonwealth in those terms in the 1967 <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-by leave- It was on a motion that I moved that this matter was referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for investigation and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments needed to achieve this are somewhat voluminous but this is mainly due to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with only one subject of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also recommended, with respect to the Australian Capital Territory, in a report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier this afternoon a proposal was put forward in a report presented by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs that Bills should be scrutinised in order to ensure that they are not in conflict with our ordinary civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise not to speak on any policy issue underlying this Bill but on a matter which I submit is equally appropriate for a house of review to contemplate- the question of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of this Bill if it is enacted in its present form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the further point that there is no basic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitation on the Commonwealth’s ability to impose whatever rate of taxation it likes on packaging as such but there are some very real <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations on the form of presentation in which that legislation can be brought forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be, and I am putting the point quite strongly to the Minister, that this legislation will be unconstitutional in its present form, and, even worse, will throw into doubt the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the whole Customs Act if it can be perceived to impose a duty of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also thank  Senator Evans  for his contribution and noted his learned comments on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> pitfalls in the path of any government under our federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, having read a speech that I made in this chamber last week, today brought down a recommendation which would suggest that the Parliament is not competent to make a logical decision unless it has someone looking over its shoulder and guiding it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have come to the conclusion that if a recommendation were brought down concerning an alteration to an Act- whether it be done by me, by some legal member of the House or by the committee that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee may desire to establish- the relevant Minister in this chamber would be unable, under this Government, to accept it, even when it is pointed out that the Act is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the function of that Committee to perform that particular role and, indeed, that is the reason why the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, in its report which was tabled today in this Parliament, recommended very strongly the case for the establishment of a further joint committee of this Parliament to scrutinise Bills for various deficiencies of exactly the kind that  Senator Cavanagh  has drawn our attention to tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most that any committee could do if a matter like this were referred to it and the most that a joint committee could do, if one of the kind that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee has recommended were already established, would simply be to report back to this chamber the deficiencies in the legislation in question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 70, however, authorises the suspension of certain <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> guarantees by the executive power “when the security of the State demands it”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-97-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their interest in the development of the Territory and the aspirations of its people have been evidenced by successive enactments of the Commonwealth Parliament which have brought this Assembly to its present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status, and we accept this generous gift as a further earnest of their continuing concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Swanson Committee reported in favour of such national legislation and the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, whose report I tabled in this Parliament in December 1976, likewise reported in favour of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A whole new set of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers is being wheeled in to sustain the legislation, not just the previous power in section 51 (20) of the Constitution relating to corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, quite on the contrary, that this legislation is in some real measure due to the recommendations of organisations such as the Swanson Committee, a Senate select committee and the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other Austraiian adults enjoy the freedom of nominating for political office without being required, by virtue of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions, to resign from their current employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes are required to allow the necessary complementary legislative amendments to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament, according to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> theory, is solely responsible for appropriating public moneys prior to expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs the Federal Government has the power to acquire the land, but it has done nothing about it, even though the Commission was prepared to make the highest bid for the property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975, South Africa officially recognised the international status of the territory and decided to initiate its own discussions in Namibia towards a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The five Western members of the Security Council (the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France, West Germany, Canada) in 1977 advised South Africa that its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> proposals arising out of these consultations would not gain international approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not do so for any narrow, legalistic or pedantic purpose but because I consider it crucial to policy, and in any case <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, to make it clear that the Federal Parliament is not abandoning its total ability to determine what shall or shall not be offences beyond the low water mark and the manner in which they are to be determined and disposed of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other important point to be made- I do appreciate that honourable senators who have spoken recognised this- is that this measure is the first in what I hope will be a series of Bills to be considered and passed by this Parliament over the next 12 months or more to give effect to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement reached at the last two Premiers conferences regarding the control of the offshore areas of Australia as a result of the decision of the High Court in the Seas and Submerged Lands Case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the basis of that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement is that the Commonwealth is recognising the traditional exercise of jurisdiction by the States in the territorial sea adjacent to their coasts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because  Senator Tate  raised the matter I wanted to emphasise that this is the first of a series of measures to give effect to that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do mind our Territory- it belongs to all of us, not just the governing group- being held up to ridicule and I object to our Territory starting on the wrong foot on its path to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its jurisdiction does not extend to prices charged by unincorporated enterprises for goods and services because of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> basis on which the Act rests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-62-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: The petition relating to the right of citizen initiative, presented to the Senate on 2 1 February 1 979 by  Senator Mason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have sought reference of this matter to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs because it is plainly the most appropriate Committee to deal with such a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Committee is busy because there is a much greater interest now in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change in Australia than there has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change would be necessary to introduce this power in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that the Australian Labor Party, both in opposition and in government, has always taken the view that the High Court should not be snowed under with original jurisdiction but should be the true pinnacle of the court system in Australia, an appellate court, a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> court, and a court which deals with intergovernmental disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objective of the Bill is to make the necessary detailed jurisdictional changes in order to complete the achievement of what the Government describes as a coordinated structure of Federal and State courts in Australia- a system in which the High Court is freed of a good deal of its previous original and appellate jurisdiction in order to be able to concentrate its scarce resources and efforts on appellate matters of major significance; a system in which the new Federal Court is vested with both appellate and original jurisdiction in a variety of matters, including the whole jurisdiction of the previous Bankruptcy and industrial courts and appellate jurisdiction from the Territory Supreme Courts; and thirdly, a system in which the State and Territory Supreme Courts become the primary trial courts in their respective areas with the State courts exercising in addition a more significant role than hitherto in the application of federal law- for example, in tax and industrial property questions and also to some extent in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> litigation at first instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which took place in Perth last year this question was again the subject of a major debate which culminated in a resolution expressing, quite surprisingly to many delegates and observers in prospect, quite overwhelming support for the concept of the creation by agreement of a single Australian court system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another major and very familiar problem area is of course that of family law, where, as is quite well known, the High Court has held in the case of Russell and Russell that there are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> inhibitions on the Federal Family Court being able to deal with the full range of matters that can arise in matrimonial and particularly child custody cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the family law type situation could, as the honourable senator indicates, be solved by the State governments being much more willing than they hitherto have been to refer to the Commonwealth under the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision in section 51(xxxvii), the exercise of legislative power in respect of certain presently exclusive State matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties in that, although there are differing views on that as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The restraining role, if it is to be performed at all, must fall largely on the upper House; and this Senate, because of its powerful <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position, is better placed than any other second chamber in the Westminster system to perform this role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly we have special <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements that force us to bring in two Bills on certain money matters which in other parliaments would be covered in a single Bill; but such Bills have a minor effect on the total and in no way explain why we pass three times as many Acts as Canada and twice as many as Britain, particularly as the British Parliament combines the functions of our Federal and State parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hamer’s motion describes one way of creating political arrangements to give effect to the fundamental <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements which we see as proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We of the Australian Democrats have not yet balloted it specifically because we have not got round to it, but I would be very surprised if our organisation and our people who are thinking about this area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal reform did not go along sufficiently with  Senator Hamer  almost to be induced to send him a membership form for the Australian Democrats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the honourable senator will be aware that in the matter of defining the responsibilities in relation to off-shore waters and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem that came up following the High Court judgment, giving the Commonwealth right over territorial waters, it has been necessary for the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government to enter into discussions relating to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790228_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That machinery is a reference to the appropriate Standing Committee of the Senate which in this instance is the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Opposition opposes the reference of this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the basis that no useful purpose would be served by so doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-What I have said should be clear enough from the lessons of our own history and from the record of the Australian people in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From the time of the introduction of the Family Law Bill into the Senate and throughout the discussions of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the clauses of the Family Law Bill, there was great concern and emphasis that the counselling procedures offered by the courts should be as informal and as adequate as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My suggestion is that the procedure contemplated in these reports which the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs have brought down, one that is quite innovative, not in existence to our knowledge anywhere else in the Westminster parliamentary world, will add a great deal to the quality of our legislative process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the conclusions of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs except those which relate to the appointment of a joint parliamentary committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have just listened to  Senator Cavanagh  speaking about recommendations contained in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In February 1978 the Government decided upon certain proposed amendments to the Judges’ Pensions Act, which included a proposal that judges who had served at least five years but less than 10 years, which is the existing qualifying period, should receive a pro rata pension if their retirement was due to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement, which was passed by referendum, of compulsory retirement at 70 years of age for High Court judges and Federal Court judges or 65 years of age for Family Court judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment to which I referred, he would be required to retire at 70 years of age and on attaining that age he would not have completed the 10 years of service which is required under the existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I certainly had in mind ultimately making a recommendation to the effect that it would be desirable, as a result of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, to make some amendments to the Judges’ Pensions Act to provide for a pro rata pension, as is provided, I think, in three States in which there is compulsory retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This of course will apply only to judges who were appointed since the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum of July 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian participation in IEA activities will therefore proceed on a basis fully consistent with the Government’s policies and with the Federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system which governs the division of government powers that may be involved in relation to those activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned about what the political situation will be in the Northern Territory because I was a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that looked into <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> reform for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 June 1978, the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs entitled ‘Priority of Crown Debts’ was brought into this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The All-Party Parliamentary Joint Committee of <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Review found in 1959: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That priority transcends the Minister’s responsibility to this chamber as a senator and therefore it can only detract from our proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the factors contributing to variations in fuel prices between the two areas is the fact that in peacetime the Commonwealth has no <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power to control reseller profit margins, ‘  Mr Fife  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement, insofar as it seems to divorce a duty to the Crown from a duty to the politically elected Government, suggests an absence of understanding of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system of South Australia or, for that matter, of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Congress, which has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and, indeed, the responsibility to monitor the CIA and US intelligence, has almost totally failed to exercise meaningful control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs produced what I regard as a generally important and good report which advocated, basically, that there was a need in relation to all legislation to ensure that civil liberties were preserved and protected; that there were no undue degrees of delegation of legislative power; and that the interests of the public were adequately protected by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australia has good reason to be grateful to those who have fought in the past, and in particular during the period of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> debates of the 1890s, to ensure that the Senate would be able to exist as a separate and distinct House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 35 per cent of the total debates during the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions of the 1890s was devoted to the question of what ought to be the Senate’s role and its powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was preparing its report it had some regard for what sort of committee should be designed for the scrutiny of legislation and said on page 15 of its report that it could be one of the eight legislative and general purpose standing committees of the Senate depending on subject matter, and existing standing committee- either the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee or the Regulations and Ordinances Committee- or a new committee specially established for the purposes- either a Senate committee or a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That fact is referred to and acknowledged in the report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to delegated legislation it has looked after the very matters which the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was concerned should be better scrutinised in legislation coming before these Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter referred to by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was the one which  Senator Grimes  found of some interest- the load on the committees as they exist at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In paragraph 4.7 of its report the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee on its report on the need for there to be some scrutiny of Bills to ensure that civil liberties are adequately preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I find myself in agreement with all speakers on some major matters that are in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others, for example the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, would have a considerable number of Bills- perhaps in the Treasury areabut on the whole there would not be any even distribution of work between the Senate committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee concludes on this particular subject matter that the doubts which have been thrown up from time to time about the scope and effect of that <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> power are, by and large, without any real substance at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to quote the reference which was given to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to help to examine the problem to which my colleagues  Senator Cavanagh  and  Senator Evans  have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 11 April 1978, the Senate resolved to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs the following matter <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the legislation and the principles and structure of the legislation are consistent with the proper responsibilities of the  Commownwealth <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether, in the opinion of the Committee, the sections of the legislation are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, comprehensive, consistent and effective, or whether any amendments should be made to the legislation ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That first paragraph sets out the substance of the Senate resolution which was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of the Commonwealth in these matters, can he provide any details of the proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the scheme involves a levy it is supported for <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> reasons by Commonwealth legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paragraph 35 I described rather than defined it as an activity whose purpose is, directly or ultimately, the overthrowing of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government, and in the meantime the weakening or undermining of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Overthrowing the government’ does not, of course, refer to the ousting by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> methods of the political party in power for the time being but the overthrow by unconstitutional methods of the established <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government or system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a summary of the Government’s response to the Reports on Annual Reports presented by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs presented its ‘Report on Annual Reports Referred to the Committee’ on  6  June 1978, while the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment ‘Report on Annual Reports’ was presented on 7 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In one specific case, however, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee requested that the Public Service Board re-examine the staff ceiling of the Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee made two recommendations: the first was that the Government consider proposals to publicise the right and means of appeal by the general public against administrative decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to ordinances of the Austraiian Capital Territory, the Committee will have regard to some criteria, perhaps taking as a possible guide the kind of criteria suggested by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in its report upon the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1 972, for determining whether the laws of the Territory ought to be made by ordinance or by Act of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence or other unlawful acts (whether by those persons or by others) for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In  Mr Justice  Hope’s recommendations with respect to the domestic aspects of subversion, without spelling them out here in detail, it was clear that the concept of force or violence as an element in the notion of subversion- the concept of overthrowing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government, of unlawfulness in the activity involved or contemplated by the persons in question- was the basic flavour that emerges from his definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of its inquiry and following the recent referendum in the Territory on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements, the Committee believes there is a need for community organisations which can both represent the local community and act as a point of contact for planners and other Government agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In November 1978 the Committee announced that it would await the result of the referendum on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues in the ACT before completing its report as the outcome might affect our report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pointing out that if one reads the whole of clause 5 it becomes quite clear, since the important criteria to be used in determining whether acts of subversion have taken place concern the use of ‘force or violence or other unlawful acts’ for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory’, that those editorial allegations were nonsensical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Edward H. Levi, the United States Attorney-General, to the United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, Sub-committee on Civil and <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Rights, in February 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that the activities referred to are those which, although not so intended, may lead to the overthrowing or destroying of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, if they were intended but may not in fact, lead to the overthrow of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government by the use of force or other unlawful acts, whether by those persons or by others, it is deemed to be an offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not necessarily follow that that person wants to be involved in force or violence or in seeking to destroy the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause seeks to give to an organisation that has been proven in the Hope report to have very considerably transgressed the law, to have transgressed in the area of normal political surveillance, to have acted illegally and improperly over a long period of years, the right to determine whether a person’s involvement or whether a view that that person might have is likely ultimately to lead to a challenge to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to give that person the right to say that that intent, the purpose of that discussion or that action can lead ultimately to a challenge to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere possession of an idea, the mere possession of an ideology or the mere membership of a person of a political party does not necessarily mean that that person is or groups of persons are involved in an issue which may ultimately lead to a challenge to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been indicated by my colleague,  Senator Evans,  because a person belongs to the Communist Party, the Socialist Party of Australia or the Marxist-Leninist Party which pursues the views of Mao Tse-tung, the mere holding of that viewpoint, the mere expressing of that viewpoint, the mere dissemination of that viewpoint does not necessarily mean that it is likely ultimately to lead, as this legislation suggests, to a course of action that involves that person in the overthrowing or destroying of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that  Senator Evans  quite correctly drew attention to this fact that even though the constitutions of those organisations may use certain phraseology it does not necessarily follow that its members are involved in activities against a lawful and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What conclusions did it lead to in respect of what is considered in this legislation as being an ultimate position- the challenge to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact if one examined the Labor movement in more detail one would find that further to the Left of those three communist organisations there are sects and groups which may well be more militant and more determined to destroy <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government than those three political bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not necessarily follow from the way these groups pursue their political activities from day to day that they are going to be participants ultimately in the overthrow of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that we are dealing at this stage only with clause 5 ( 1 ) (a) which relates to the following:  activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence … for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth or of a State- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the use of force or violence must have as its purpose the overthrow or destruction of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that anybody or any organisation which believes in and has a commitment to the use of force or violence at some future stage, even though it may not be engaged in such activities at the moment or may not even intend to engage in them in the near future, for the purposes of overthrowing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of this country should be regarded as subversive and should be kept under surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>overthrowing or destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That word is ‘the’ before <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the purpose of overthrowing or destroying <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the overthrow of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government in a commonwealth, State or territory that is to be deplored and which the clause aims to avoid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to bring it back to a particular government when surely we should be defending a general principle that we deplore or wish to avoid the overthrow or destruction of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth or a State or territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the greatest ambitions of  Senator Georges  is to overthrow the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Government of Queensland but I do not think  Senator Georges  intends to carry out any unlawful acts to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he goes out into the streets he is inviting the police to engage in force or violence but the intention of the police is not to overthrow the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that those engaged in force or violence in Queensland following the activities of  Senator Georges  are engaging in activities for the purpose of overthrowing the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my activities ultimately lead to the overthrow of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government by force or violence, I take it that I would not be subject to surveillance unless I intended my activities ultimately to lead to that overthrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that a person’s activities may lead to force or violence but unless it was that person’s intention ultimately to overthrow a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government that person should not be subjected to surveillance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should occur only if the person’s activities are intended ultimately to destroy a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that a person’s activities may ultimately lead to force or violence is no reason for that person to be put under surveillance unless they are for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it will lead to surveillance of ordinary innocent activity within Australia; innocent in the sense that the end may be innocent and certainly in that the method sought to change <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government is innocent of motives that ought to be achieved by unlawful or violent means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the means to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact he has made it clear that the Government regards the word ‘ultimate’ as being a desirable power to be given to officers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation so that they may make an evaluation in any given circumstance that they consider could lead to unlawful acts which would overthrow or destroy a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the Government is saying that any person who is a trade unionist may be held under surveillance because in the opinion of the ASIO officer the person may ultimately be involved in a challenge to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or elected government or may be involved in an unlawful act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, every one of those 20,000 citizens who marched in that demonstration- as would be the 100,000 who marched in the great Vietnam moratorium demonstration in Melbourne- was involved in an unlawful act which could lead, in the opinion of ASIO, to an ultimate act of violence and the overthrow of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of this Act, the activities of persons, other than activies of foreign origin or activities directed against a foreign government, that are to be regarded as subversion are- (a) activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence or other unlawful acts (whether by those persons or by others) for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt  said that this clause brings in under its cloak respectable organisations whose only offence is that their activities may lead to violence for the purpose of the overthrowing of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that many of them or many of the members of the Transport Workers Union who are on strike would vote to retain the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government federally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about violent activities for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am involved in carrying out my proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities as a senator on behalf of the people of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commence my remarks by taking the Senate back to the substance of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs entitled ‘Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on Queensland Reserves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee considers that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conception underlying the principles and structure of the legislation are consistent with the proper responsibilities of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said at an earlier stage that one of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which dealt with acquisition was based upon the premise that this co-operation would not be forthcoming or would not be productive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If land is acquired in the face of State resistance and where the Commonwealth otherwise has no particular <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powersuch as it has in the Northern Territory- there are problems in providing basic services to that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one thing is clear in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs it is that Acts of this Parliament concerning the acquisition of land can be effective only if there is complete co-operation between the State and Federal governments, as I think has been the case in a number of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a layman and the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee is comprised mostly of lawyers of some standing in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenged the Federal Government to live up to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibilities by acquiring the two communities under the powers granted in the 1967 referendum which changed the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a motion sought by all members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, including  Senator Evans,  so that we would have an opportunity to bring forward ideas about what is in this report and to encourage honourable senators to read the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report draws attention to the reports of the Standing Commmittee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs relating to the delegation of parliamentary authority and the scrutiny of Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with standard <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice, any proposal to dispose of or charge any public moneys will require a message of the Administrator to the Assembly before it can be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are aware that there are differing views on the matter and it is to be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those land and mining matters in the States are primarily the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of State governments, but we have been taking that interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to understand the position clearly, it must be said there is no legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> means whereby a Federal Government can force a State government to impose a State income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As will be readily understood, this aroused some interest in relation to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we took evidence throughout the country, and as we talked to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> authorities, we were very firmly of the view that the evidence established clearly that the Commonwealth had what we called a coalescence of power in a number of fields, including taxation, defence, foreign affairs, fisheries and quarantine, which gave it sufficient legislative competence to lay down and enforce a national approach through legislation alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I urge the Attorney to accept  Senator Cavanagh  ‘s amendment as a realistic one and as one that imposes no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition will be aware that few people have recognised the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems in relation to the Great Barrier Reef area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Constitutionally, the States have rights over seas and submerged lands adjacent to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Capricornia Reef is not declared at the moment due to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Webster  was correct in showing that some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties arise out of the questions of 3-mile and 12-mile limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall saying that the reasons for the Capricornia section of the marine park not being proclaimed were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and then, in response to a further question, denying that he was aware of any intentions to renew permits for drilling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Yes, I do recall saying that there were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790503_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear from the tone of this letter that what has since been described as ‘the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue’ was a secondary consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Newman’s  letter went on to refer to correspondence from the Prime Minister on this point, but it is clear from the tone of  Mr Newman’s  letter that there is a considerable dispute between his Department and  Senator Webster’s  Department, and that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue is being used by  Mr Newman  as an excuse to hold up the proclamation of the park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response  Senator Webster  said that the only reason for the delay in proclamation of the Capricornia section of the park was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one involving the renegotiation of jurisdiction over off-shore waters following a decision of last year’s Premiers Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster went on to say that the proclamation of the Park had been held up purelyand I stress the word ‘purely’- because discussions are taking place on what he described as a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This answer drew a supplementary question from me asking him to specifically deny that the only issue was the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one and that the Government was considering renewing permits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Capricornia Reef is not declared at the moment due to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition will be aware that few people have recognised the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems in relation to the Great <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he now deny, in view of what he has just said, that it is purely a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter between the Commonwealth and the States as to why the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef has not been proclaimed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Capricornia Reef is not declared at the moment duc to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall saying that the reasons for the Capricornia section of the marine park not being proclaimed were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and then, in response to a further question, denying that he was aware of any intentions to renew permits for drilling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I do recall saying that there were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his attack on me he stated that something more than the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects relating to this particular section of the reef was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister reiterated to me the comments of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to me that no action is to take place until those <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters are brought to a head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I answered the question as to whether there was anything other than <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters holding up the declaration of the Capricornia section of the Marine Park, I had in mind the comment I have just quoted, that is, that the lessees are not seeking renewal of oil leases within the area of the proposed Capricornia section of the Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  says: ‘Well, look, this is really all a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question’, lt was not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question in the mind of  Mr Newman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the proclamation of the Capricornia section of the Marine Park had not been made for <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to that question  Senator Webster  tried to pretend that the aspect delaying the proclamation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question between this Government and the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, when he was pursued about that,  Senator Webster  repeated that it related to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before 1 refer to  Senator Webster’s  reply, let me remind the Senate that they were the two matters of substance dealt with in  Mr Newman’s  letter- not <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues, not environmental issues, but the consent of the oil companies and the consent of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that there were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal problems associated with this off shore area of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the man responsible for the Act and its administration, he said that the reasons that steps had not been taken to proclaim that area as a marine park were generally of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  repeated that the Capricornia Reef is not declared at the moment due to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other matter that arises is the answer given by  Senator Webster  that there had been no proclamation because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, however, that even in the letter from the Minister for National Development it is clear that he is aware of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement of the powers relating to the marine parks is a matter which is under intense discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Senator Webster  and I are shortly to have discussions with Queensland Ministers in relation to these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal questions, so that at the Premiers Conference at the end of June this year we can come to final settlement of these matters by agreement, after consultation with the States, and not by the imposition of centralist doctrinaire socialist confrontation which is the way in which the Opposition would seek to solve these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the future of the Barrier Reef, its protection, the declaration of marine parks in the area and the settlement of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems are important issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 refer him to the resolutions of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention held in July last year which were tabled in Parliament last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, does the Government support the holding of another session of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention either in Adelaide later this year, as was proposed last year, or at some other time and place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not considered either of the matters raised by  Senator Evans,  namely, what action, if any, may be contemplated in relation to some resolutions which were passed concerning the court system or when future meetings of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention should take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If my recollection is correct, there was a very considerable division of opinion at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention even in regard to some of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will look at them again to refresh my recollection, but I do not believe it would be feasible to put forward referendum proposals arising out of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention unless there were a very strong consensus at the Convention itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the question of any future meetings of the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention has not been considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point has been made on several occasions during the week that the declaration of the park is held up awaiting discussions between the Commonwealth and Queensland AttorneysGeneral, relating to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters in regard to the reef area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument, recently raised by  Senator Webster,  that it was only the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue holding up the proclamation of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue has arisen only since the Premiers Conference in October 1977 as it was at that Conference that the Commonwealth decided to hand over control of off-shore waters to the States, including the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, prior to that Premiers Conference, there was no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue but the Park was still not proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what  Senator Webster  describes as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers with respect to navigation and shipping arc acknowledged and no joint authority is contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems extraordinary that these major <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> shifts are being organised by the Commonwealth in this secretive way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When those <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> shifts involve the likelihood of serious damage to the Great Barrier Reef, it is about time this Senate put its foot down and demanded to know in advance just what the Commonwealth has in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads me to the other matter that  Senator Wriedt  raised, which he believes is a matter of concern; that is the discussions that have taken place between Premiers and between AttorneysGeneral as to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal problems that arise in the off-shore areas all around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Commonwealth Government is engaged in a very major effort to reach a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement with the States in regard to the territorial sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By resolution of the Senate on 2 1 April 1 977, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was, at its own request, given the task of inquiring into the matter of processing law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the implementation of the reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has noted that the Commission has now produced six major reports since its establishment in early 1975, only two of which have so far in fact been implemented- and those two only in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that a person who has been a judge, who presumably has retired, perhaps as a result of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment relating to age, and who no longer holds the office of a judge shall now be eligible to be appointed to the position of a presidential member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But certainly, as far as age is concerned, I think it can be said that the Government is very alive to the decision of the people by way of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, we have included a similar provision in the freedom of information legislation and we are awaiting the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not presume to prejudge or even trespass upon the possible breach of privilege by commenting on what the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommend regarding access to personal files and documents when it comes to dealing with the question of freedom of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent  Senator Button’s  moving an amendment to this motion for the third reading of the Bill to refer the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Missen as  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee has often told the Senate how worth while have been the deliberations of his Committee on matters such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, in its freedom of information reference, has been taking evidence and deliberating now for something of the order of at least 20 days, which would represent approximately 1 20 hours of consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Government has been unable to do to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission because of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> autonomy, it feels quite free to do to the Prices Justification Tribunal; and that is what this Bill is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May, 1975 a royal commission in the person of  Sir John  Nimmo was set up to review fully the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> future of Norfolk Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament also should have grave reservations about it- about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system that it embodies and about the immunities from the operation of Australian legislation that are part and parcel of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system which is created by this Bill is a nineteenth century one- great stuff for the heyday of the British Empire, but not the kind of thing that is in any way appropriate to the latter part of the twentieth century, which is a time when colonies are just a little bit out of fashion, and rightly so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key things to appreciate about the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> system which is created by this Bill are as follows: First of all, it confers minimal powers on the elected Legislative Assembly; secondly, it confers negligible powers on the appointed Executive Council; thirdly, it gives quite excessive powers to the Australian Government appointed administrator; and, fourthly, it enables the retention by the Australian Government, acting through the Governor-General, as the Bill puts it, of quite excessive residual powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that it means exciting disloyalty against the Queen and the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Government, and inciting people to illegal actions, as a means to overthrowing the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is unlikely that the Administrator was motivated by a desire to defend <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 3 May 1979, in response to questions concerning the proclamation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, he stated that it was only a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue involving off-shore waters which was delaying the proclamation of that Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the only factors inhibiting the proclamation of the Marine Park were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> ones involving off-shore waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third issue which  Senator Webster  had to establish in his defence on that day was that only the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue stood in the way of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the view of the Opposition that the earlier correspondence made available to this Senate convincingly demonstrates that there were issues other than the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one and that  Senator Webster  had indeed misled the Senate on 3 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, he was saying that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue was no barrier whatsoever to proclaiming the Park. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point that I think I made in my earlier address to the Senate is that various Ministers are responsible for various attitudes and actions, which they must responsibly have in relation to this particular area of Queensland:  Mr Anthony,  from his standpoint as Minister for Trade and Resources;  Mr Newman  in his position as Minister for National Development; and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in his interest in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters arising out of a Premiers Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested that it should be delayed until <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters were cleared up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not withdraw one tittle from my declaration made in the Senate that the matter holding up the declaration of the Park was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Capricornia Reef is not declared at the moment due to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster has said on a number of occasions-even today- that the thing that is holding up the proclamation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is really a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue with the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that some element of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> discussion with the Queensland Government has had some effect in holding up the proclamation of that Park, but  Senator Webster  comes here and says that the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue is the only issue that is holding up the proclamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pulls that out of the bundle of letters to which he says he is not going to refer because they are confidential, and it happens to relate to the issue of discussions on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first defence is: There are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues involved’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That question was paramount in the mind of the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  and the hold up was not purely a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issue as  Senator Webster  has stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It relates to legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that it is purely a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter between the Commonwealth and the States as to why the Capricornia section . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  I believe that what  Senator Webster  has said, the documents that have been produced and the arguments that have been given in this chamber on previous occasions clearly establish that  Senator Webster,  in answering those questions and giving the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> or legal reason as the only reason why there was delay in the proclamation of this National Park, was quite justified and certainly was entirely honest and entirely consistent with his credibility as a Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Government has the ultimate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power here to ensure that the policies are carried out and to ensure the exercise of its responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said in a similar debate recently, the discussions with the States are on the basis of the exercise by this Parliament- not anybody else- of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You will recall,  Mr President,  that I excluded from my remarks the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles who, under our present <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements, have a certain role to perform which I believe they discharge with a certain vigour and charm, probably to general acclaim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Excluding the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles, who have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> role to perform, the continued subservience of this Government to other members of the royal family symbolises its total loss of touch with the vast majority of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is the Minister aware that judges such as  Sir Owen  Dixon and  Mr Justice  Else-Mitchell have drawn attention to the fact that section 92 of the Constitution is defective in not referring to Territories such as the Australian Capital Territory, and that this matter has been raised at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this not represent a serious anomaly in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements and a source of discrimination, real and potential, against the Australian Capital Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question is one that has been considered at the Australian <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1978 <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Perth did consider a report from its standing committee, which expressed the opinion that section 92 was unsatisfactory to the extent that it prevented reasonable non-discriminatory regulation of interstate trade, similar to that which  Senator Knight  has mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is of no consolation to the people of Australia that the Commonwealth has ultimate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power if it permits the Queensland Government to act as that Government sees fit and to allow drilling on the Reef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw, in Queensland’s treatment of the Aboriginal people in those areas, that ultimate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in the hands of the Commonwealth Government is worthless if it is prepared to allow the Queensland Government to take over the administration of those activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Government is determined that drilling on the reef will take place if the Commonwealth allows it to get control over those areas- even if the Commonwealth retains ultimate <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power- such drilling is inevitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said that whilst the Commonwealth Government had undoubted total <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power and could use that power- and in its discussions with the States was working within that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powerthe Government felt that the wording of the motion was so narrow that it was inflexible in the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst we respected the objective, we found the mechanism too delimiting, even though we may move through that mechanism to assert our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr President, the High Court of Australia occupies a supremely strategic place, not only in our legal system but also, by virtue of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> adjudication, in our political, our social and our economic system as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like  Sir John  Kerr,  Sir Garfield  Barwick certainly earned a place of a kind in that history by virtue of the role he played in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis of 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Marine Park had not been declared because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions which had to be resolved in discussions with the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster  told the Senate that the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park had not been declared because of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions which had to be resolved in discussions with the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, I make it clear that the note that was passed to me by  Senator Webster  was, in fact, a copy of the letter from the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to  Senator Webster  in which the Prime Minister indicated that the only barrier standing in the way of the marine park being declared was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy includes the fact that the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is near to declaration as a national park and that fundamentally the discussions between the two governments relate to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We recognised our pre-eminent <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility and powers and said that we would act accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matter, as  Senator Webster  said time and time again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What in fact his statement reveals is that the answer given by  Senator Webster  about the position in respect of the proclamation of Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems which have led to that not yet being proclaimed was a perfectly correct answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been repeated by the Attorney-General who has gone through the detailed <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems that arise- whether the matter relates to arrangements under the Federal-State agreement, whether it relates to decisions in respect of the seas and submerged lands legislation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No member of this chamber could say that it was not a proper expression of government policy about the proclamation of the park, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position ofthe Federal Government and the policy of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for five separate Acts arises from a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that laws imposing taxes should deal with one subject of taxation only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement that laws imposing taxation shall deal with one subject of tax at a time, it is necessary to have a number of rating and assessment Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, wool that is exported requires a third Act to meet the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a recently published article entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Obstacles to Organised Marketing in Australia’, Michael Cooper quotes comments from various justices of the High Court of Australia in the Clark King case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt is perhaps a little glib, with respect, to try to distinguish qualitative from quantitative considerations in the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> context of funding education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I seek to make is that it is very difficult to distinguish qualitative considerations- if they are things one just talks about in the Senate- from quantitative considerations in view of the role of the Federal Government in education funding, lt has no real <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the changing nature of Commonwealth-State relationships reflected in the education sector is one of the factors that we have to bear in mind in discussions of the Commonwealth’s role of providing the money, as it does in the schools sector, without having much of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to see that the money is spent according to its own priorities that it may consider important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying in this debate on education, which deals with the provision of money to schools, is that I made the point earlier that the Commonwealth has a very limited <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> capacity to direct the money it provides to the States for schools assistance into the areas which appear to be the areas of considerably greatest need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government acknowledges that it has <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, I invite the Government to have a look at its performance in the area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in relation to Aborigines, and its performance in relation to the Queensland Government on that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790604_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to make clear- I hoped that I had made it clear in the debate in the Senate some time ago- that whatever relationship is settled upon between the States and the Commonwealth- and this includes marine parks generally and the activities of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in relation to the territorial sea of Queensland- as to the respective exercise of jurisdiction, the Commonwealth Parliament will at all times retain the full <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, legal power, to exercise its ultimate will and control in relation to the matter of marine parks or, indeed, anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She seems to forget that by the most democratic procedure possible the future <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements in this Territory were put to the people of the Territory last November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While this inquiry into the development and preparation for the orderly control and development of mining of uranium was taking place, there were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes being planned in the Northern Territory which involved the giving of powers to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason or other,  Mr Justice  Fox did not at any stage touch on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes that were developing side by side with the proposal to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an unusual situation and I can only assume that if the attention of  Mr Justice  Fox had been drawn to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes taking place in the Territory, there would have been some reference in the report which came from the inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, I wish to say that at an appropriate stage I will propose as an amendment that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its report on the scrutiny of Bills the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has drawn attention to the need for the Parliament to ensure that its authority is not unduly delegated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would support his amendment, if it ever gets off the ground, that the Government should withdraw the Bill, anticipate the future- it is what the future will bring- and refer it as every other important piece of legislation should be referred, to a standing committee of the Senate, to wit, the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, for examination so at least it can get it right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I gather that the drift of what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Chaney)  had to say did not really meet my concern, namely, that the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs was put down on 2 June 1 978. lt is now 7 June 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would point out to him that I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs that brought forward the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Commonwealth Employees ( Redeployment and Retirement) Bill 1979 be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, and that the Committee report to the Senate on or before 3 1 August 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In its report on the scrutiny of Bills the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has drawn attention to the need for the Parliament to ensure that its authority is not unduly delegated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I put it to you,  Mr President,  in particular, and to other honourable senators that we should refer this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for examination and report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are some <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems in granting moneys direct to local governments but these can be overcome, and I believe have been overcome by previous governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has never been specified by these <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> literalists what sections of the Constitution were alleged to have been breached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, Lord Hailsham is asserting that republics are necessarily corrupt and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> monarchies are above corruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepted that Committee’s criticism and agreed that any payments to judges, on the highest <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles, should be provided for in legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strictly speaking, the answer to the question is ‘ nil ‘, as any transfer of the nature referred to would require a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As lawyers well know, one of the most nightmarishly and fiendishly complex areas of the law is that area of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law which involves the delineation of what is an exercise of judicial power as distinct from an exercise of non-judicial power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One particular report which was presented, I think, immediately before that date was the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the abolition of the priority given to Crown debts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a further three reports of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- one in respect of rules of court and two in respect ofthe scrutiny of debts and the delegation of parliamentary authority- were presented more than six months ago but no Government statement has yet been made on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to note when the Bills were referred:  12.4.72- Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972 referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs at the second reading stage . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>31.3.77- Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1977 referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs at the second reading stage . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all been part of that process, particularly the committee that I am now  Chairman  of, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Bill in regard to trade practices might be the concern of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce, but also perhaps the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While rejecting the validity of existing <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements which allow a white minority to control the levers of power, he accepted that a democratic constitution was not incompatible with special provisions for the white minority in the form of reserved seats ‘even out of proportion to the numbers involved’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We maintained that further <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> changes in the direction of greater Africanisation were essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communique made nine points: The Heads of Government: confirmed that they were wholly committed to genuine black majority rule for the people of Zimbabwe; recognised, in this context, that the internal settlement constitution is defective in certain important aspects; fully accepted that it is the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> responsibility of the British Government to grant legal independence to Zimbabwe on the basis of majority rule; recognised that the search for a lasting settlement must involve all parties to the conflict; were deeply conscious of the urgent need to achieve such a settlement and bring peace to the people of Zimbabwe and their neighbours; accepted that independence on the basis of majority rule requires the adoption of a democratic constitution including appropriate safeguards for minorities; acknowledged that the government formed under such an independence constitution must be chosen through free and fair elections, properly supervised under British Government authority, and with Commonwealth observers; welcomed the British Government’s indication that an appropriate procedure for advancing towards these objectives would be for them to call a <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> conference to which all parties would be invited; and consequently, accepted that it must be a major objective to bring about a cessation of hostilities, and an end to sanctions as part of the process of implementation of a lasting settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason that Bishop Muzorewa was able to become the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe was that there was an agreement whereby the white population of Rhodesia- a group with which I have never had any identification; nor have I expressed any great admiration for it; nor indeed have I spoken of it in the past in this place, I would have thought, in other than condemnatory terms- agreed, for the sake of peace, to enter into a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangement whereby it forfeited majority rule to the black population but retained certain powers for the time being under a constitution which was subject to amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such, there may well be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the honourable senator for the point of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> practice which he made clear to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(The Tribunal is aware that there might be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations on the powers of Parliament in this area, but such limitations would apply equally to the powers of the Tribunal itself. ) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me simply say that I do not believe that the language of the section as presently drafted inhibits the Tribunal from looking at aggregation or concentration issues when considering the public interest point, and certainly I do not believe that there is any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> inhibition upon it in taking into account cross-ownership questions in determining issues relating to ownership of the electronic media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having done that, I want to make some brief comments about the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of that report has been a matter of comment by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs,  Mr Viner,  because the report raises a number of issues which are relevant to two annual reports which were considered by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs drew attention in its comments in relation to these two reports to two important matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other report to which the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs adverts is that of the Science and the Environment Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might, on reading  Hansard,  think that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs had the temerity actually to give a report on the Senate Standing Comittee on Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator overestimates the bravery of the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which would never dare to do such a thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, one of the major matters which the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee reported on was the request of the Government to re-examine the Law Reform Commission’s request that five extra staff members be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 1 on the General Business paper, the report by my Committee, the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, on reforming the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommended that the Government consider proposals to publicise the rights of the citizen to appeal against administrative decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now debating General Business Order of the Day No.11 which concerns the report on processing law reform proposals by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs I wish to address a few remarks to the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Committee which presented the report which is before the Senate, namely, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, is almost at the stage of being able to bring to the Parliament its final report on the Freedom of Information Bill which was introduced into the Parliament by the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to only three other recommendations that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs came forward with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to thank my colleagues who have spoken in this debate,  Senator Evans  and  Senator Puplick,  who are members of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs and who have stressed various recommendations of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recommended that the Government should take the bull by the horns and do something other than supply lip service to Aboriginals in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, five reports of the Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs have been tabled, nearly all of them important reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs recently tabled a report on reforming the law and the procedures which should govern the implementation of reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that there are jurisdictional distinctions between them in the exercise of their ordinary judicial powers, but in this cass we are selecting them for the purpose of issuing warrants without regard to their jurisdictional limits, which are entrenched in our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> Federal system and historical reasons, which many people think ought to be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that some members of the Opposition, probably of this chamber, supported a resolution at the last <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention which was designed to obtain a uniform system of courts in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget that the primary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle to be upheld is the one of ministerial responsibility to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We are faced today with a Government decision which ignores completely the recommendations of a bipartisan Senate committee- the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairsand I will justify that statement in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise in this debate to support the remarks of my colleague from Victoria,  Senator Missen,  but I hope to do that from a short distance away, the distance being that I am not a member of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, and I was not a member of that Committee at any time when it considered this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 21 April 1977- less than  2lA  years ago- this Senate referred the problem to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point which the statement does not mention is the need for the Commonwealth Government to obtain <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power so that it can impose a more uniform system of industrial relations throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government consider supporting such a move by initiating legislation for a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> referendum on the question? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators are aware, there was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, of which I was a member, looked at the clauses of the Woodhouse proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing new about the concept of a national compensation scheme, but I believe the Government is hung up over <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulties and, at the beck and call of its mentors in the insurance industry, it has failed to take action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their offence had been to distribute leaflets reminding people of their <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> rights not to vote or to vote by secret ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their importance has been emphasised in recent reports by the Senate Standing Committees on Publications, <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, Finance and Government Operations, and Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he also aware that, according to respected Tasmanian legal authorities, the election of most members of the House of Assembly will probably be declared null and void and, therefore, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> right of the present Government to occupy the treasury benches is in serious doubt? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States and the Northern Territory will continue to administer fisheries inside the threemile territorial sea, in accordance with and subject to the arrangements that have been agreed under the off-shore <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> settlement successfully concluded with the States at the recent Premiers Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of answers to questions given earlier this year when this matter was being discussed, are these anticipated as being the last round of consultations with the Queensland Government regarding what were previously referred to as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> issues and is a result likely to flow quickly from these consultations early in October? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The position is that the first meeting of the ministerial council associated with the Great Barrier Reef is to be held on 4 October, and that has nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> arrangements which, on my understanding, have been basically put aside as a matter that is basically firmed up between the Federal Government and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs should investigate what is operating in other places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs should look into the matter and advise us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under Australian law, the AAT has the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> status of an Australian Territory similar to that of any other federal territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was all that I was looking at in relation to those matters which were, as I understood them, mainly matters of law or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these circumstances and the fact that practically all the evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on this subject, with the striking exception of that of the Commissioner of Taxation and the Department of Finance, favoured total abolition of such priorities, will the Government now reconsider its position? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not proposing to reconsider its decision in relation to the priority of Crown debts which has already been announced in a statement made in the Senate in relation to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in answer to a question yesterday,  Mr Street  asked me to look at  Mr Justice  Staples’ letter to see whether there were any legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications arising out of it in regard to the proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which will be debated in the Senate later today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the AttorneyGeneral whether he or his departmental officers have at any time been asked to advise the Minister for Industrial Relations and his Department on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act presently before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Industrial Relations as to any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions that had arisen or might arise in relation to the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was done at about the time that instructions for the Bill were being first considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So long as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements are met and our advice is that they have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not heard yet the answer from the Attorney-General,  Senator Durack,  as to the serious criticisms that were made by  Sir Richard  Kirby and  Mr Justice  Staples about whether the proposed amendments were <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, one expects to find a Bill which is in harmony with basic <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principles which respect the impartiality and integrity of the conciliation and arbitration process and which make it quite independent of the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are constitutionally valid, and I do not claim to be a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> lawyer or, indeed, a lawyer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, a highly respected Australian, a former  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Sir Richard  Kirby, who was the  president  of the Commission for 17 years, was reported in the Melbourne  Age  of 22 September last as saying that the legislation stopping the Commission from acting in certain ways was probably invalid and would be liable to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, it is bad in <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implementation of a provision of this kind would represent a clear shift from the operation of this legislation, and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provision on which it is founded, as being directed to the conciliation and arbitration of individual cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard it as incompatible with the whole <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as it has evolved over the last 70 or 80 years, for the position of individual commissioners to be forced into that particular mould in the way which the Government is intending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A provision of this kind in the Act will not stand any kind of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge to its validity- a point that was made very vigorously by  Sir Richard  Kirby, a point that has been denied ever since with equal vigour but with a great deal of wrongheadedness by the Government spokesmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is exactly why  Sir Richard  Kirby said that it was a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> piece of nonsense and that is exactly why the Attorney-General should hang his head in shame that he should have the folly to bring in such a childishly incompetent piece of legislative drafting containing a provision of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has also been mentioned that  Sir Richard  Kirby has questioned the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of some of these amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are industrial, legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objections to the type of suggestion that is proposed in clause 3 to overcome the problem that we all know exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to go into the legal or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objections to that provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not suppose any of us here would suggest that this Parliament is the body which will ultimately determine the legality or constitutionality of those provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view, again there are industrial, legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objections to that suggested proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there ought to have been a better look into the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is important, particularly in respect to the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> aspects of these clauses which have been challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one turns from what one would say is the very dubious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objection which has been raised to the problem of the actual operation of this provision, one will be concerned with the fact that there are objections from commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put this not on the basis of any <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> objection but on the basis that it does seem to lead to some lack of confidence in the commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it, likewise, is of dubious <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see how that power fits into conciliation or arbitration, bearing in mind what was said by  Sir Robert  Garran about <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> limitations and the fact that it must be a power in respect of the settlement of disputes and not just a wide open power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know also that there is power in the High Court to ‘read down’ powers, as happened in regard to the Family Law Act, so that they fit within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> framework and so that they can operate without defeating the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that that is not so and that, in terms of the legislation before the Senate tonight, the words he was using relate to the support of workers and in no way destroy the unions in a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions of the 1 890s there was some debate about what form of power the Federal Parliament should have over its arbitration procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> conventions of the 1890s there was much discussion of the way in which power should vest in the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its views are that the requirement of consultation raises problems of a legal, industrial and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate a number of questions were raised about whether the provisions in this legislation are <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would simply like to repeat that these legal and <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> questions have been the subject of attention and advice by my Department and by me during the period in which this legislation has been developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question is decided by the High Court of Australia, which is the only body that can determine in the end whether something is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, we do not propose to the Parliament legislation which is obviously unconstitutional or about which there are grave doubts or concern as to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator mentioned other matters such as the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> problems and the Boilermakers case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The operation of this supposedly co-operative and consultative committee of the nation’s Attorneys-General was the subject of some very stringent criticism by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in its recent report on reforming the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well established that, as a matter of Federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law, persons can continue to be regarded as immigrants if they are born overseas and have come here from overseas, even after they have been naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A summary of it can be conveniently found in Campbells and Whitmore ‘s book  Freedom in Australia,  Second Edition, pages 194 to 196, or any reputable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law textbook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that there is on the present case law a point at which a person becomes a member of the community or becomes absorbed into the community- as the judges have put it- so that at that point the person ceases to be an immigrant for the purposes of the reach of Federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, one still can have a situation where someone has been in Australia for just three years, applies immediately for naturalisation and, I am suggesting, can be construed as the law now stands as an immigrant for the purposes of federal statute law and for the purposes of the reach of federal <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, and as such be then liable to the impact of these particular sections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, I present a report on the Committee ‘s reference on the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 and related aspects of the Archives Bill 1978, together with the transcript of evidence taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-by leave- This is the most substantial and comprehensive report ever produced by the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Archives Bill 1978 be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible, in so far as the Bill relates to issues common to, or related to, the inquiry into the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the terms of this resolution, the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs concentrated its Archives inquiry on Part V of the Archives Bill relating to Commonwealth records with particular emphasis on access to those records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also recommend that the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee should undertake a review of the legislation’s operation three years after it is first proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore I do not want to canvass in any detailed way the conclusions of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have therefore invited the public accounts committees of State parliaments to consider holding complementary inquiries as State authorities have a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility for the administration of tertiary institutions, including accountability for the distribution of funds to those institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That petition took into account the inquiry which had been made by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which indicated that the operation of the Commonwealth legislation could be defeated by the sort of action which was taken by the Queensland Government in March or April of 1978 to abolish the reserves to which the legislation might be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware also of the conclusions of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in 1975 following its investigation into national compensation, which were based on substantial evidence from a number of expert witnesses and which indicated that accident prevention could be influenced by economic incentives such as differential premiums which encourage positive safety programs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the attitude of the Government is concerned, it agrees that this is an area which needs attention, but occupational safety and health is primarily the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> responsibility of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator also asked whether I am aware of the conclusions of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It asked whether we are satisfied that the Commonwealth has the necessary <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But experience so far surely should have persuaded the Government, and certainly persuaded  Mr Bailey,  as the Government’s main adviser in this area, that cooperative federalism, here as elsewhere, is destined to be an abject failure, and that there is no prospect of getting effective, inegrated acrosstheboard machinery unless the Commonwealth itself takes the initiative and exercises that <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power which it almost certainly in my belief at least has available to it under the external affairs power, and enacts its own human rights legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the common law tradition, which may influence judicial approaches towards favouring the liberty of the subject in the interpretation of statutes or <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions has not always been all that self-evident in the decisions of our courts . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It anticipates the final form of the Freedom of Information Bill 1978, which is presently being investigated by the Senate’s <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, which will soon report to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is that there is a possibility of a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge to the whole operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads the most recent report from the Commissioner, one will see that the Queensland Government has denied that the Act is constitutionally valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It points out these facts and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity which is under challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yesterday in this chamber the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the Freedom of Information Bill was presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the present Racial Discrimination Act is under challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs said quite early in its recommendations in its report on legislation associated with Mornington Island and Aurukun that the Constituion  would stand up to a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> validity of the Racial Discrimination Act 197S has been questioned since it became law on 31 October 197S. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One eminent jurist has advised the Commissioner that provisions of the Act, including certain prohibition provisions, cannot be supported by Commonwealth <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers since they are not directed to people of a specific race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the great majority of the people in this country believe that this legislation will stand up to <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope one would plead with the AttorneyGeneral, that, having this report before him now and having before him a report from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs- which seeks in terms of the Sankey judgment and other matters to argue as precisely as it can argue on those pages against the system of conclusive Ministerial certificatesunless he expects the members of the Consitutional and Legal Affairs Committee and other members of the Senate not to believe that this report is being treated with monumental contempt, he will make some sort of attempt to come to grips with the question of whether conclusive certificates, which this Committee recommends, ought to be subject to a number of qualifications and appeals which should not appear in the Freedom of Information Bill or the Archives Bill and, equally should not appear in the Human Rights Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One concerns the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power of the Federal Parliament to enact human rights legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a speech which the former Attorney-General-  (Quorum formed)  I was saying that there was some debate as to whether the Commonwealth possesses the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to enact human rights legislation which might have any effect whatsoever upon the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside the serious doubts which I share as to the power of the Federal Parliament to legislate on the matter for the whole of Australia (there would appear to be no <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> difficulty associated with the Commonwealth and each State legislating for Bills of Rights in their respective areas of responsibility), there are other difficulties which I see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments shall come into force when they have been approved by the General Assembly and accepted by a two-thirds majority of the States Parties to the present Protocol in accordance with their respective <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A full year ago, on 23 November 1978, the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs presented to this Parliament a report on the scrutiny of Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there had been some attempt to bring the States within the purview of the Commission, I could understand why there has been no attempt to take on the hard <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question whether we could have judicially enforceable rights which could be won when at variance or inconsistent with State laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the present Government ‘s commitment to an expanding role for the States and the benefits of decentralised decisionmaking and recalling that if a major political party campaigns against a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment, the amendment has almost no chance of being passed, can  Senator Carrick  envisage any way that  Mr Hawke  ‘s proposal to abolish the States can succeed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the fact that the Government is not attempting to reach into the States’ sphere, is not attempting to use any special <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, such as the external affairs power, in order to reach into State jurisdictions, which is where most breaches of human rights in Australia occur, it is unfortunate that the Government did not take the opportunity to set itself the very difficult task of defining for its own laws and territories those human rights which ought to be secured without the sort of modifications and reservations which are expressed in the International Covenant which is taken now as the document of criteria of the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the freedom of information report recently tabled by the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, in relation to clauses which were of similar structure in that they simply relied on conclusive certificates of the Executive to prevent documents being obtained under the Freedom of Information Bill, it was decided by the Committee that nevertheless reasons for non-disclosure need to be given to an impartial tribunal so that it can decide on the relative strength of the claims made by the Executive for non-disclosure as against, in that case, the need for a full disclosure in accordance with freedom of information philosophy; in other words, let an independent tribunal judge where the public interest lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to pre-empt the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For our present purposes, the most important is Article 2 under which, if we ratify the Covenant, we should commit ourselves to taking the necessary steps in accordance with our <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> processes to give effect to the requirements and rights recognised in the Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> justification of this was the external affairs power; the doctrine that if we enter into a valid external treaty that obliges us to do certain things, the existence of the treaty gives the Commonwealth Parliament the powers necessary to give effect to the treaty, even to the extent of powers which would otherwise be beyond Commonwealth competence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind, the fundamental defect of the Murphy approach was that a Bill of Rights based on the United Nations Covenant would quite possibly be <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>, under the external affairs power, but it would be in many ways less than our present rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But attempts to extend the provisions in the Bill to cover the rights we have and should have would probably be unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would certainly be entitled to do this under the external affairs <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before we pass this Bill which is openly intended to enable the Government to ratify the UN Civil and Political Rights Covenant- if the amendments moved by  Senator Missen  and  Senator Evans  are accepted that would be made explicit- we must be sure that the Government is prepared if necessary to use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power within a reasonable time to ensure that the Bill is effective in all parts of the Federation without any limitations or exceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This course of action is partly as a  reult  of severe <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> question marks over the Federal Government’s powers to legislate to protect and enforce human rights as well as the Government’s belief that the guaranteeing of these rights does not require a Bill of Rights and the accompanying judicial powers of enforcement, believing instead that the present law adequately protects these rights and that Parliament is the more  appropriate  body to ensure the continued protection of these rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been commonplace for candidates for political office who have been forced by <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> provisions to resign in order to contest elections and who have failed to secure election, thereafter not to be reappointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason it is crucial, if this legislation is to have any utility at all, that it be extended into the State domain, using all the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power that the Government can utilise obviously under the external affairs power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will recall that the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs presented a report to this Senate entitled ‘Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on Queensland Reserves’ exactly one year ago this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By requiring the process to be undertaken whenever a vacancy on the High Court occurs, this provision should do much to ensure that the Court continues to be truly national in character and fully equipped to discharge its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> functions as a Federal Supreme Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment arises from the expression by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs of its view that the present wording of section 7s of the Evidence Actwhich was inserted by the Amending Act of 1978- leaves it open to doubt whether Parliament has the power to disallow Rules of Court so made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs which presented the report to which a response has now been made by the Government, it is my desire to say a few words about that response. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 29 March 1979 the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs presented its report on Parliamentary scrutiny of rules of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Whether further legislation or a <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> amendment is desirable would depend on the outcome of the challenge in Uebergang’s case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-78-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents a response to a recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it may be quite appropriate for big <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> cases to be conducted in the pomp and majesty of the new national building across the way, it seems to me, and to the Opposition, that in quite a number of other cases the convenience of litigants, especially their financial convenience, perhaps should be the primary consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we believe that in order to achieve this the critical consideration is not a question of geographical balance sustained over time, or at any given point of time, in the composition of the Court, but rather the certainty that the best men and women in the nation are appointed to the Court,, the best both in terms of their scholarly ability and technical expertise across the range of law with which they have to deal- especially <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> law- and in terms of the kind of vision and breadth of understanding and approach that they bring to their job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has said so in the other place and, indeed, at the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is new and is based upon an undertaking which I gave on behalf of the Government at the last <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the opinion, and have been for a long time, that the power of the Parliament seems to disappear on matters relating to the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and its attempt to get uniform legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expresses its concern at the Government’s apparent abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for corporations and the securities industry pursuant to the Commonwealth’s own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 (the Rae Report); <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expresses its concern at the Government’s apparent abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for corporations and the securities industry pursuant to the Commonwealth’s own <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly this was amply demonstrated by the Rae report which made a very strong argument for the operation of a single national system of company law, implemented and enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament, pursuant to its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and also for a single national governmental regulatory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new approach the Rae Committee recommended was built very much around the concept of national legislation and national machinery established by that national legislation in pursuit of the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government, when introducing its own corporations and securities industry legislation in 1 974 and when foreshadowing the further introduction of substantive companies legislation which was to be introduced in that illfated week in November 1975, was certainly satisfied that the corporation’s power in section 51(xx) of the Constitution in itself, provided sufficiently ample <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> foundation for this kind of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it is possible to rely constitutionally on the trade and commerce power on a number of individual heads of power like the postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications power, and incidental power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The banking power and insurance power; I will not stop and endeavour to lecture the Senate on the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> possiblities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>uncertainty as to the extent of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power should never of itself be a reason for opposing an otherwise worthwhile legislative exercise of power; nor should it prevent a government, properly advised, treading where angels of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> probity have formerly feared to tread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly I have noticed no great <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> timidity on the part of the present Government when it has been enacting new sweeping draconic amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in fairly obviously blithe indifference to the possible constraints imposed by section 5 1 (xxxv.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is odd and interesting that an attack of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> jitters seems to overcome it whenever the matter of corporations law and securities industry regulation comes in issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>uncertainty as to the extent of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power should never of itself be a reason for opposing an otherwise worthwhile legislative exercise of power, nor should it prevent a government, properly advised, treading where angels of <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> probity have formerly feared to tread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government rejected that view of its one.ume Attorney-General and its one-time guru who in 1 975 was said to be infallible on <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> matters when he presumed to advise the Governor-General and everyone else as to the correct procedures that should be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, the present Government believed that, regardless of questions of its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power, the proper approach would be one in accordance with its policies and philosophy of co-operative federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be heartened in my belief in this position if I could have an assurance from the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Durack)  that if the Senate passes this Bill, which is openly designed as a mechanism by which we can ratify the United Nations Covenant, the Government is determined to make the human rights legislation effective in Australia by any means in its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like an assurance that it will try co-operative arrangements with the States and that if they do not work it will use its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to make the Bill effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I seek leave to make a statement concerning the report of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on the Evidence (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in April 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- As the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs, I welcome the response that the Government has made to its report on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now find a Senate Estimates committee coming up with the statement, with which I completely agree, that any Parliament which claims or aspires to accountability of an executive government to the Parliament must make such arrangements for its own resources and facilities as are necessary to achieve this <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship in practice as well as in theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for the Parliament properly to fulfil and maintain its function, it must make such arrangements as are necessary to achieve its proper <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> relationship with the Executive, in practice as well as in theory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be that we are outside the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power in including in Appropriation Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are dealing with the points which  Senator Rae  has made, I think we should look at the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position and at the expenditure of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider  Senator Rae’s  proposal, the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> position and the agreement reached with the Prime Minister and the Senate in 1965 on what we should deal with we see that this matter is something that will have to be tested at some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee therefore recommends that the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: The provision of legal aid services in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Committee recommended that it should be limited to consideration of legal aid in the Australian Capital Territory, I am sure that the matter of legal aid generally should be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Kilgariff,  who gave evidence before a joint parliamentary committee looking into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> reform for the Northern Territory, well knows that I repeatedly asked people in the Northern Territory whether they wanted a north-south line as was promised to them under the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he reads the transcript of evidence given to the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory in its inquiry into <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> development he will find that I repeatedly spoke about a survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier in the evening, on behalf of Estimates Committee B, I moved a motion relating to the reference to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs of the question of the provision of legal aid services in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the motion referring the question of the provision of legal aid services in the Australian Capital Territory to the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs be withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth Government should act quickly to enact the strongest possible sex discrimination legislation consistent with its <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers and in the spirit of the recommendations developed by the Council’s National Conference on proposed Commonwealth sex discrimination legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement relates to the recommendations of the Senate committees, in particular the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement which was put down- as it was only tabled and not incorporated in  Hansard,  I will have to describe it and go through it very briefly- is one which relates to the Government’s response to two reports of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs; one relating to the scrutiny of Bills and the other relating to the delegation of parliamentary authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the statement now made by the Attorney-General, I shall read from the statement I made when I tabled the report of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee, I stand by what the Committee said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An editorial in the Melbourne  Age  of 3 September 1979 referred to the recommendations of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT ON REPORTS OF SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON <span class="highlight">CONSTITUTIONAL</span> AND LEGAL AFFAIRS ON “SCRUTINY OF BILLS” AND “DELEGATION OF PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORITY” <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Reports of the Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on “Scrutiny of Bills” and “Delegation of Parliamentary Authority” were tabled in the Senate on 23 November last year and debated on 1 March of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise very briefly to express my grave concern at the contempt shown for this chamber in this ministerial statement on the reports of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would enable Senators Hamer and Evans to speak for no longer than 10 minutes each to the motion to take note of the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs reports on scrutiny of Bills and delegation of parliamentary authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In general, given the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> constraints u. der which the Federal <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-102-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot visualise  Mr Fraser  exposing himself to a charge in international forums of failing to take action which was within his <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> power to overrule a State government’s attempt to prevent Aboriginals from voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs: The provision of legal aid services in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position has been considered by the Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs to which it is proposed to refer this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs came to the same conclusion in its report on the Freedom of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs has submitted a major report on the Freedom of Information Bill which raises these matters for debate and consideration by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make only one further comment and that is that it might not be as effective as one would like, even within its own terms, to the extent that the Opposition would regard it desirable not only that an aggrieved individual or group be able to litigate but also that the Human Rights Commission have the power to initiate litigation on behalf of someone so aggrieved, as was a provision in the Human Rights Bill 1973 and as has been recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs in respect of the enforcement of freedom of information matters by the Ombudsman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In which of these countries do human rights, in terms of the practical <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> freedom of citizens, approach the standards: (a) laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and ( b) enjoyed by the average Australian in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considerable <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> and legal difficulties were involved in giving effect to the Convention in Australia, particularly in creating a paramount Commonwealth register of interests in aircraft and in relation to existing requirements for registration of mortgages or chattels generally in each State and Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-92">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They raise what could be far reaching <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Democratic Labor Party will support the amendment foreshadowed by  Senator Rae  which is to the effect that this Bill be referred to the Senate <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee conditionally on its reporting back in a fortnight, that is, by 1st May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe the legislation is <span class="highlight">constitutional</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, I present the report from the Senate Standing Committee on <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs on Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on Queensland reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Constitutional</span> and Legal Affairs Committee was charged with this reference following the passage of the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Bill in April 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our attention has been focussed on the constitutionality and effectiveness of the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Selfmanagement) Act 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in assessing the effectiveness of that legislation we have reached firm conclusions as to the scope of the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> powers of the Commonwealth in respect to Aborigines, the extent and variety of powers in respect to the acquisition of property and the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> requirements to provide ‘just terms’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>The Committee is of the opinion that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978 is within the <span class="highlight">constitutional</span> competence of the Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></li>
