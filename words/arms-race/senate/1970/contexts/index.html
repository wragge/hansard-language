<ul>
  <li>
    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, and directly involves Australia even further in nuclear war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is conscious of the fact that in the long run the security of the world as a whole will depend upon effective measures to control the nuclear <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and to bring about general and complete disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know now that because of technology, which in the last 20 years has advanced more than we have since the dawn of time and which in the next 20 years will advance further than we have now since the dawn of time, even including the last 20 years, we cannot go on having an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> or having a cold war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History has shown that whenever there is an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> it has inevitably led to war- world war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to those people who scorn us when we try to have the reverse of an <span class="highlight">arms race</span>: ‘What is your alternative?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative that is put to us, is to have an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and to say to the U.S.A. that it can have 10 per cent more arms than the Russians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has attacked the provision of facilities on Diego Garcia and accused the United States of America of threatening a naval <span class="highlight">arms race</span> in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, and directly involves Australia even further in nuclear war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, and directly involves Australia even further in nuclear war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, and directly involves Australia even further in nuclear war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed a renewed <span class="highlight">arms race</span> now looms as a real prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, there is continual pressure not only from within Australia but from outside to reduce defence expenditure as a contributing factor to the lessening of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strategic <span class="highlight">arms race</span> has been mentioned as one area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any opportunity to overcome the deprivation, the poverty, the disease and the squalor around this world that I mentioned a moment ago is beset by the great <span class="highlight">arms race</span> which a large number of countries have joined post 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is going on throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competition within this <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is feared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that as time goes on we can see a reduction in this <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In theory it is an excellent idea to support the initiatives to lower the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> in this area but in reality such a move could be accepted as appeasement and appeasement has never operated successfully because the end result is that there is one dominant power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it represents a major escalation of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, and directly involves Australia even further in nuclear war strategies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their reaction, of course, is to engage in an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> to match the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Prime Minister aware that in the final document adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament held in New York in 1978, many countries expressed their concern about the continuing threat to mankind of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the spiralling costs of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and the effect of the latter on the economic and social development of the peoples of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it also deplores the fact that there is an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and that there are spiralling costs of armament throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noting that, while millions starve, expenditure on the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is $1,000 million per day for the World, and $7m per day for Australia; and noting that the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has listed ‘peace and disarmament’ as a theme for the International Year of the Child; and further noting that a reduction in expenditure on arms could contribute in both developed and developing countries to the eradication of hunger and disease and to the provision of more adequate housing, education, health services, economic security and social welfare for all people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noting that, while millions starve, expenditure on the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is $1000 million per day for the World, and $7 million per day for Australia; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because today marks the start of Disarmament Week, it is appropriate for the Senate to consider again the effect of recent attempts to limit the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the resolutions that it adopted was to invite states to carry out effective measures to expose the dangers of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, to propagate the need for its cessation and to increase public understanding of the urgent tasks in the field of disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> in Europe will accelerate and all thought of a mutual reduction of forces will be ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of the particular issue, the circumstances demonstrate that unless the level of distrust between nations is lowered, even minor matters can lead to another outbreak in the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already referred to the resolution of the 33rd session of the General Assembly which called for the dissemination of information and for the organisation of symposiums, meetings, conferences et cetera, to expose the danger of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and to increase public understanding of the urgent tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>compared to the risks of not disarming, the risks of sitting on your hands’, of drifting on with the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and the so-called balance of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like a juggernaut defying all attempts to control it, the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> today continues with mounting speed and intensity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States Senate,  Senator Mark  Hatfield said that SALT was another one of those escalating steps in the nuclear <span class="highlight">arms race</span> which would stimulate production of new weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This threat would prompt the Soviets to take counter measures, escalating the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> to still more dangerous levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something like $ 1 m is spent every minute on the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In individual countries the percentage diversion is mostly in the 2 per cent to 8 per cent bracket, although in some cases there are expenditures ranging from one per cent to 30 per cent of the gross national product on the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider the connection between the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, with its economic cost and social and political effects, nationally and internationally, constitutes an important obstacle to effective progress in establishing a new international economic order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resources now being absorbed by the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> are scarce and are needed for socially constructive ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite apart from other economic problems the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On several occasions it has been seen how the public, when adequately informed, can exercise a moderating influence on developments in the field of armaments, and fostering a genuine and widespread public concern about the dangers of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> may be one of the most important ways of giving a new momentum to efforts towards disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me sustain that argument in this way: The <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is fundamentally inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noting that, while millions starve, expenditure on the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is $ 1 , 000m per day for the World, and $7m per day for Australia; and noting that the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has listed ‘peace and disarmament’ as a theme for the International Year of the Child; and further noting that a reduction in expenditure on arms could contribute in both developed and developing countries to the eradication of hunger and disease and to the provision of more adequate housing, education, health services, economic security and social welfare for all people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>
