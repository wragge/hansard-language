<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What reasons have been made known to him for the refusal of nations to surrender their sovereignty to an agreed supranational authority to an extent necessary to make redunant the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and the balance of terror as the existing unstable basis for world peace (Hansard, 5 May 1970, page 1648). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 take the view that the Soviets had already won the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and can clinch their policy of world domination any time they please. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Laird  has made some very cautious statements about the subject of the Russian presence and has no intention of committing his Government to a dangerous and very damaging <span class="highlight">arms race</span> in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed a renewed <span class="highlight">arms race</span> now looms as a real prospect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it has strained relations with a major trading partner, the Soviet Union, which as recently as yesterday responded by accusing Australia of stepping up the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and heightening tension within the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should this trend continue it could lead to an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> of dangerous dimensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two leaders agreed that the fact there was a possibility of a renewed <span class="highlight">arms race</span> between the super powers gave cause for concern, and any shift in the global balance between the super powers could have far-reaching implications for the long-term security of the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That country is also heavily involved in the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  President  of the United States of America sends his Secretary of State,  Mr Cyrus  Vance, to Moscow to talk with  President  Brezhnev about the question of a genuine and worthwhile cutback in the nuclear <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>American-Soviet talks on curbing the nuclear <span class="highlight">arms race</span> collapsed in Moscow today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is, I believe, a matter of concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we can have a situation in which one super power can simply turn its back on reason and discussion designed to halt the nuclear <span class="highlight">arms race</span>; when we have a situation in which one super power can thumb its nose at the world, I believe every Australian who is concerned about the future of this country, and the world, has a duty to speak out as I have done tonight, no matter what the honourable member for Melbourne and his pro-communist allies like to say on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report talks about the consequences of the Middle East <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It mattered not at all that the implications of such a successful move would have been the transportation of the destabilisation of the international <span class="highlight">arms race</span> to Australian shores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is exactly the same kind of thing with an <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is some regulation, everybody has to engage in the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> because otherwise they cannot survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> in the world because there is no real regulatory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position in the world today is that countries have to engage in the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> whether they like it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they all pale into insignificance compared with the threat to the world and to the continuance of humanity by the great <span class="highlight">arms race</span> which continues, despite the change in the world at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we should be doing is initiating an attitude that no <span class="highlight">arms race</span> shall occur here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The thought of an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is quite ridiculous when one considers the history of this country and this region and considers the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt- and a great body of world opinion now accepts this-that the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is the greatest threat to the security of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should try to let people see that a common-sense approach to the modern world does not require the re-equipment of armies and the fantastic expenditure and intellectual energy that goes into the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780524_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the NPT, the nuclear weapons states have undertaken to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the real threat to humanity comes from what has now become the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to do everything in our power to reduce the expenditure on arms, the impact of our arms expenditure in this region and use whatever influence we have with our neighbours to prevent them embarking on an <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus it would be a more effective way of halting the nuclear <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly on that subject we have seen a special report by a United Nations expert group on the economic and social consequences of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and military expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognition of the need for undertakings by all states in regard to nuclear non-proliferation objectives and for all nuclear transactions to be under effective international safeguards; the importance of substantive measures of nuclear disarmament by the existing nuclear weapon powers both as an objective in its own right and as an inducement to strengthening the existing non-proliferation regime; the urgent requirement for a comprehensive nuclear test ban and a new SALT agreement; and the desirability of a cessation of production of fissionable material for weapons purposes by the nuclear powers as a step towards scaling down the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education: Disarmament and the <span class="highlight">Arms Race</span>  (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What allocations have been made or are intended to be made to each of the States and Territories for the preparation of school material designed to contribute towards a greater understanding and awareness of the problems created by the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and of the need for disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussion of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and the need for disarmament is included in many social studies programs in Australian schools, at both primary and secondary levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no Commonwealth programs which make specific allocations for the purpose of preparing school material related to the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and the need for disarmament Australian schools do, however, have access to material of a high standard produced both by the United Nations and Unesco, a considerable amount of which has been distributed in recent years by the Australian National Commission for Unesco. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781124_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-58-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  has pointed out, there can be no hope of an end to the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, no hope of arms control or of disarmament without SALT II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world is sick mainly in that it makes the wars and the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and ends up in fights as the so-called means of solving a dispute, mainly because we refuse to see the alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the one that history shows is the only alternative to a warlike end to an <span class="highlight">arms race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790308_reps_31_hor113/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Negotiations on strategic arms limitations matters are obviously a very important part in halting an <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and in achieving a world where there is less suspicion and less tension than there might otherwise be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, however, the strategic balance is upset and the guidelines under which they operate change, if there is an escalation in the <span class="highlight">arms race</span>, a proliferation of nuclear weapon states and an increased risk of nuclear war, any sensible Australian Government will have to consider what will happen to the bases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790523_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">arms race</span> is not diminishing but increasing and outstrips by far the efforts to curb it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trend of increase in the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> will continue, not least because of the underlying force of military research and development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government do more to make the Australian community aware of the dangers of the <span class="highlight">arms race</span> and the overwhelming need for world disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-66-17">[More…]</a></p>
