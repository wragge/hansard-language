    <p>If this were one of the traditional customs of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, one would expect that the person charged would not receive the same penalty as someone in our capital cities or someone who was not influenced by a traditional custom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia and New Zealand are two countries whose people are predominantly of European descent and which are situated in the South Pacific area, far from people of our own <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are living beside one of the great and significant movements of history, one of the  most  significant things that has happened in the history of the human <span class="highlight">race</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terrible concern that people in Australia have is not that members of the DLP are hypocritical but that they mean what they say when they say that we should be refusing to ratify the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and when they say that we should be acquiring nuclear arms of our own, so setting off a <span class="highlight">race</span> and a chain reaction among all the smaller nations around the world to acquire nuclear arms oftheir own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not have to reiterate this history which goes back 900 years during which the Vietnamese people, a gallant and proud <span class="highlight">race</span>, defended themselves against all-comers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of at least one occasion when a senior member of the Office was told - and witnesses can be produced to confirm this if a royal commission is held - that if he found any fault when carrying out an inspection of the living and working conditions of some of the people of his <span class="highlight">race</span> he was not to speak about it publicly at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the Parliament does last its full term it is a shocking state of affairs when one considers that in 1970 - 200 years after Australia was discovered by the so-called superior white <span class="highlight">race</span> - we are still discriminating against the original Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last generation or two of Australians have realised that the Aboriginals were becoming a vanishing <span class="highlight">race</span> and that we should do more to protect them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then Minister for Post-war Re-construction, the honourable J. J. Dedman, said: ‘We do not want a <span class="highlight">race</span> of little capitalists’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today we are trying to find a <span class="highlight">race</span> of people and to emancipate them from the Establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has tried to destroy, to decimate and to commit genocide on a <span class="highlight">race</span> of proud people whose only wish is that they should be given independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy that the Government is carrying out today is the same policy that the German Fascists carried out against the Jews, the Poles and other races in Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is taking on the role of the Herrenvolk, the master <span class="highlight">race</span>, lt believes we can destroy this whole <span class="highlight">race</span> of people yet still have the hide to consider ourselves as Christians, people commanded not to kill and people who are commanded to do unto others as they would that others should do unto them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, he was saying that our young Australians are behaving in the way in which the Germans behaved in the worst stages of the 1930s and the 1940s- that they are deliberately setting out to murder and expunge from the earth a <span class="highlight">race</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was jealous because he thought he was being left out in the prestige <span class="highlight">race</span> of the right wing reactionaries of the Liberal Party so he had to come in to defend the statements that had been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The military industrial complex of Germany had as a background the Krupp empire with all the militarism of the Prussians, lt had as the ideal historical background this long training of the German people towards the belief thai they were a superior <span class="highlight">race</span>, the Herrenvolk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the brainwashing, over generations that they were the superior <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably still more frightening for the great majority of the human <span class="highlight">race</span> who are neither Europeans nor North Americans, but are Latin Americans, Asians and Africans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, modern taxonomic thought considers the Bennett’s wallaby as a sub-species or <span class="highlight">race</span> of the rednecked wallaby(‘Macropus rufogriseus’) which is widespread and abundant in eastern parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is pointed out the applications for all forms of war service homes assistance, including proposals to buy group homes, are considered only having regard to the requirements of the Act which contains no provisions in any way related to the colour, <span class="highlight">race</span> or nationality of applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have now moved into the field where, if a person of white <span class="highlight">race</span> has married outside the pure white <span class="highlight">race</span> he will be refused assisted passages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take this to its logical conclusion it means that even if a person of white <span class="highlight">race</span> who had married another person of white <span class="highlight">race</span> adopted an Asian or coloured child, they would be prevented from receiving assisted passages to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final paragraph of the Minister’s answer is one of the most disgraceful sentences 1 have ever read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in the first paragraph of his reply made it quite clear that Government policy now is that a person of coloured <span class="highlight">race</span> who is not a European cannot receive or obtain- an assisted passage to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Lim, an Indonesian national of Chinese <span class="highlight">race</span> was first admitted to Australia for educational purposes in February 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we are faced with an application by a British person whose only crime is that he has seen fit to marry a person of another <span class="highlight">race</span> and that he has children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is this <span class="highlight">race</span> of 12 million people scared of? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries judge us rightly if we make a decision on such a case that the man cannot come for no other reason than that be happens to be married to a person of a different <span class="highlight">race</span> and that he has children who are of mixed <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It illustrates the Government’s fear of one man, his wife who is of a different <span class="highlight">race</span> and his children who are of mixed <span class="highlight">race</span>, ls it not true that in 30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>40 or 50 years the wife will be longer be here, and if the children come here they will most likely be intermingled with people of our <span class="highlight">race</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the goodwill engendered by the tremendous amount of money we are spending in bringing people to this country will largely be offset by the poor reputation we will give Australia in the minds of thinking people in every part of the world, of whatever <span class="highlight">race</span> or whatever nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we get to the situation where a British subject born in England and of European <span class="highlight">race</span> has married an Indian lass and is denied an assisted passage to this country because one or more of his family are ineligible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a disgraceful situation when, because he chose somebody he desired to spend the rest of his life with and because he chose to have a family and bring young children into this community, the Government says ‘No’ because the colour of his wife’s skin is different, and because the colour of his children’s skin will be different, from the colour of his own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a most disgraceful thing and cannot be fobbed off as far as I am concerned by the Minister saying that if it was an adopted child- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a controlled immigration policy which says that no person, whatever his colour or <span class="highlight">race</span>, or whatever be his creed, is to be denied entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Government has extended its policy now to include Europeans and people of other races who possess the skills which Australia needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia needs their skills one would expect it to be prepared to help them financially, whether they are European or of any other <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are prepared to assist an Englishman who has special skills to come to Australia, we should assist an individual of any <span class="highlight">race</span> to come to Australia if he has skills which we require, lt was part of the policy to admit into this country nationals from other countries if they had skills which we required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that all honourable senators would have a sense of pride that we have in our assembly one who is a member of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span>, one who has an understanding of the problems of the people of his <span class="highlight">race</span> in particular, and one who has shown in his speech last night a bigness in his approach to these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall the importance of the swearing in ceremony when this new Senate was formed and the historic event which was recorded in the annals of this Senate when  Senator Bonner,  a member of the indigenous <span class="highlight">race</span> of the Commonwealth of Australia, was the first of his <span class="highlight">race</span> to be recognised to represent the people of Australia, and In particular the people of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not happy about the percentage of it; nor should the honourable senator be happy about the percentage of it amongst his own <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Aborigines always have been a very dignified <span class="highlight">race</span>, particularly until the white man introduced grog and things like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although I will be trying, to the best of my ability, to bring about a situation where my fellow Aborigines will have a permanent lobby in Canberra, I do not feel that at this time I can support the motion to disallow the Ordinance because, as I said earlier, it can do no good for my <span class="highlight">race</span> whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that the people were of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> was inconsequential to the principle involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A group of militant Aborigines, even if they are not representative of the whole movement by the Aboriginal people, is not prepared to permit their <span class="highlight">race</span> to persevere under the conditions of the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it speaks well for a member of their <span class="highlight">race</span> who happens to be a member of Parliament to disown them to the extent that he would criticise anyone who seeks to be of some benefit to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently, respected trade union leaders have told me that on jobs where there have been industrial problems he has had a tendency to get one of his messengers to go on to the jobs and provoke the people belonging to their <span class="highlight">race</span> to continue working. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLANDIf  Senator Little  is suggesting that parents who send their child to a State government school have to do so because they spend their money on <span class="highlight">race</span> horses, I think, frankly, that that is a pretty poor interjection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite apart from Aborigines as a <span class="highlight">race</span>, I am far from satisfied today that we are geared sufficiently to meet the situation as more and more manual work is phased out and that we are able to provide job opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact remains that although we are training a <span class="highlight">race</span> of people who will be skilled technicians to service the non-manual operations, fewer of them will be needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that there is a great need to assist the members of my <span class="highlight">race</span> in relation to housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is a need for special legislation and special assistance to help members of my <span class="highlight">race</span> who have come from a completely different culture and who are striving to adapt and integrate into the general community and become what we all want to be - respected and responsible citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I say this I mean competent Aborigines, not necessarily academically brilliant but Aborigines who have suffered the problems which are facing many members of my <span class="highlight">race</span> at this time and who have been able to overcome these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support it because it is a step in the right direction and will be of great assistance to members of my <span class="highlight">race</span> in finally taking their place in the community as respected and responsible citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main concern of this organisation is that while we are working towards Aboriginal advancement, we are endeavouring to build a better understanding of our people among nonAborigines in order to improve present existing <span class="highlight">race</span> relations where our cultural differences seem to make it difficult for non-Aborigines people to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever they are, they managed to survive, to their great credit, in an environment in which I am certain that our own <span class="highlight">race</span> of people would not have survived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were the sort of things which helped to sustain them in the environment in which they were forced to extract a living - which they did - and which would have caused many other races and many other nationalities to disappear from the face of the earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot believe that they expect me and other honourable senators to accept this proposition enthusiastically because, as thinking people, we know that without complete power as the centre of government we are not in the <span class="highlight">race</span> in controlling prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the requisition for the surrender of the fugitive, although purporting to have been made in respect of an offence for which, but for this section, he would be liable to be surrendered to that state, was made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing him on account of his <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion, nationality or political opinions; or <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to that, in respect of any of the new treaties with which we are dealing, insofar as we are changing or extending the law there would be a prior onus - if one likes to call it that - on the Attorney-General that he is not to give a notice - that is, not to set the process in train - or even to bring the person before a magistrate if there are ‘substantial grounds for believing’ that in effect, as  Senator McManus  is putting it, the person is being dealt with because of his political opinions, <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years I have advocated, both at the State and Federal levels, even prior to my becoming involved in politics, that perhaps one of the main solutions to many of the problems facing members of my <span class="highlight">race</span> is the involvement of competent Aborigines working in the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today many members of my <span class="highlight">race</span> suffer what we may term psychological scars because of the destruction of their own customs, traditions and culture and because for far too many years Aborigines were treated perhaps with less esteem than the household pet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it very pleasing that  Senator Little  has taken a different attitude when speaking to this Bill from that which he took on the previous occasion when he spoke about Aborigines and said that he believed they owed a debt of gratitude to the white population of Australia because we had preserved their <span class="highlight">race</span> which otherwise would have died out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only a few weeks ago, I. remember, some motion was pulled on, again out of order, without any proper notice because at that time a meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General was in progress in Sydney; and so I had to depart from Sydney and <span class="highlight">race</span> back to Canberra at night in order to- deal with such a motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rather peculiar <span class="highlight">race</span> of people in the island called Tasmania to the south of Australia, who have been enlightened in many matters and have shown the way to their mainland friends on many occasions, many years ago introduced an electoral system known as the Hare-Clark system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that it is writ large in the literature which passes into the hands of the electors throughout Australia, because I believe that it will have the same impact on the Labor Party’s fortunes as did  Mr Dedman’s  famous phrase of some 28 years ago, ‘that the Labor Party did not want to create a <span class="highlight">race</span> of little capitalists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who have studied the history of the Polynesian people, and particularly the Western Samoans, would very rapidly appreciate the fact that for purposes of integration this <span class="highlight">race</span> probably has more qualities than has any other <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Australian Government’s announced intention to take over the full financial responsibility of all tertiary education, will the Minister take steps to see that all institutions receiving Federal funds accept the fundamental principle that no students will be discriminated against as a result of their <span class="highlight">race</span>, creed, politics or sexuality? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is reference to <span class="highlight">race</span> and religion which I think are generally acceptable as being extraneous grounds for almost all purposes, and there may be some controversy about the other ground mentioned by the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, section 25 of the Constitution provides that if by the law of any State all persons of any <span class="highlight">race</span> are disqualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the State, then in reckoning the number of people of the State or of the Commonwealth, persons of that <span class="highlight">race</span> resident in that State shall not be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A basic provision of the legislation is to provide that everyone is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the legislation, without distinction of any kind, such as <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Universal Declaration proclaims in its first Article that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and Article 2 provides that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, including discrimination on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Committee also made representations to the Australian and State governments for the establishment of <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Boards to administer legislation which would prohibit discrimination on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span> in respect of the provision or sale of goods, facilities or services, employment and conditions of employment, membership of trade unions and similar organisations, the purchase, sale or rental of housing accommodation, and the availability of business premises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are still remnants of legislative provisions of the paternalistic type based implicitly on the alleged superiority of the white <span class="highlight">race</span> in which it is assumed that Aboriginals are unable to manage their own personal affairs and property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be the height of hypocrisy for white Australians now to say to Aborigines that from here on the <span class="highlight">race</span> must be on equal terms, without taking into account the 180 years start which white Australians have given themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has gained acceptance in the <span class="highlight">race</span> relations legislation of the United Kingdom and New Zealand and it is also widely recognised in North America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill is divided into 7 parts, the first dealing with preliminary matters, the second with the prohibition of racial discrimination, the third with investigations and civil proceedings, the fourth with offences, the fifth with the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Council, the sixth dealing with administrative provisions and the seventh with miscellaneous matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 8 makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or perference based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or other field of public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of clause 9 is to guarantee equality before the law without discrimination as to <span class="highlight">race</span> in the enjoyment of rights and this clause will supersede laws of Australia or of the States that discriminate on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span> in relation to the enjoyment of rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of clause 13 is to make invalid the provisions of the rules of a trade union that prevent a person from joining the union by reason of his <span class="highlight">race</span>, and the clause also makes it unlawful to prevent a person from joining a trade union because of his <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should point out that there are a number of other features of the Queensland legislation relating to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders that are not in terms discriminatory on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span> or that form part of legislation intended to be beneficial but which are nevertheless unsatisfactory from a civil liberties viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 7 also exempts from the operation of the Act charitable instruments conferring benefits on the persons of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 16 makes provision for the vicarious liability of principals and employers and clause 17 ensures that the Bill will apply in situations where an act is done by reason of <span class="highlight">race</span>, notwithstanding that this was not the dominant reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part III provides that there shall be an Australian <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be an offence to refuse a person access to places and facilities on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, an act of violence to a person of a different <span class="highlight">race</span> will be an offence under the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Council is established in Part V of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part VI of the Bill deals with the administrative provisions and provides for the appointment of an Australian <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner and his staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part VI also provides that the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Council is to consist of such members, not being less than ten or more than twenty, as the AttorneyGeneral appoints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision is included as it applies in circumstances where the reason for the doing of a discriminatory act alleged to have been done on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span> lies peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is a first, but essential, step in providing measures for the elimination of racial discrimination in Australia and for the guarantee of rights without discrimination on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the NACC is successful; but to be successful it needs the co-operation, assistance and support of every member of the Australian community regardless of colour, <span class="highlight">race</span> or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the first thing we have to realise- I have some difficulty about your ruling,  Mr President-  is that while we and you in your highest office may want recognition of all as Australians, the Aboriginals are a proud <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than wreck the scheme when it is about to be put into operation, those people who have any consideration for this <span class="highlight">race</span> of people should join with us in ensuring that the scheme does work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As they were members of what was once such a happy and proud <span class="highlight">race</span>, I was wondering whether it would not be better to use the expression ‘the varying stages of their degeneration until they eventually got down to the level of the white man’s commecial way of living in the cities of the various States and the drinking of his poison’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of some of the things which have happened recently, I have become rather concerned particularly in relation to the problems which are facing members of my <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the first and only, to date, elected Aboriginal member of Parliament, I seek the indulgence of the Senate for I feel compelled at this point in time, because of what is happening to my <span class="highlight">race</span> with threats of violence and the inevitable backlash which will take place, to refer today to 3 sections of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My first appeal would be to those of my <span class="highlight">race</span> who are young, frustrated, eager and impatient for change and who, I feel, have been led to believe that violent demand is the answer to the present problems facing our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the young of my <span class="highlight">race</span> mean the kind of black power which says that I am proud of my <span class="highlight">race</span> and I am as good as the next person, and if they get out and help themselves in the white man’s environment and beat him at his own game, I say that is good black power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn my young friends that I will have no truck with the other kind of black power which, I know, brings in its wake violence, and I warn against it as I have done previously and as I will continue to do.I say to those of my <span class="highlight">race</span> who are young, who have had the advantage of an education and who are articulate: ‘Use these God given talents to influence the thinking of non-Aboriginal communities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many have had the opportunity to become members of various committees, and they can do much for the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> and the Aboriginal cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many young people of my <span class="highlight">race</span> can do much by working within the present system because I believe that the present system can be made to work for Aborigines by Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warn again the young and impatient of my <span class="highlight">race</span> not to let themselves be brainwashed into believing that violence can solve the problems which are of concern to all members of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> because those people who encourage them along this course are evil and have no true concern for the benefit or the cause of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the forum of this Parliament let me now address myself to the older members of my <span class="highlight">race</span>- those who, like me, have suffered so much because of past discrimination and prejudice; those who, because of the attitudes of the past, have lived in squalor on the banks of creeks and have seen the destruction of their culture, yet have been able to fight back and to give their children the best education that those conditions would permit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say this to my <span class="highlight">race</span>: Whilst we remember the bad things and endeavour to rectify them, let us also put on record our appreciation of the good things, such as the hand of friendship that has been extended and the opportunities that are now being offered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a strange thing it is for the Whitlam Government, with its Rabelaisian tastes, a Government which will spend millions of dollars to <span class="highlight">race</span> around the world in chartered aircraft, taking 70, 80 or 90 people along, including family, relatives, and loads of champagne, to suddenly say that we must not have elections because they cost money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, those who have the power of government recognise that if people are asked unnecessarily on too many occasions, too frequently, to express an opinion as to which Party should be in power there will be a reaction against them because it is generally accepted throughout the community that governments have an obligation to govern and if they must <span class="highlight">race</span> to the people from time to time, either to have a issue determined by way of a referendum or to put their own authority on the line, there is a likelihood that the public reaction will be that some other government will get on with the job and will not require such frequent commendation of what it is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know now that because of technology, which in the last 20 years has advanced more than we have since the dawn of time and which in the next 20 years will advance further than we have now since the dawn of time, even including the last 20 years, we cannot go on having an arms <span class="highlight">race</span> or having a cold war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The common law provides few effective remedies against discrimination in the exercise of human rights, whether it is based on <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour or on any other grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Canada, compulsory evidencegathering powers are given to Human Rights Commissions and similar powers are vested in the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Conciliator established by New Zealand legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The absence of evidencegathering powers in the United Kingdom legislation has been said to impede seriously the effectiveness of the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board under that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They also draw there for positions when they line up for the <span class="highlight">race</span>, and this is the way it ought to be when we line up for the greatest <span class="highlight">race</span> in the world, namely, to see who can be elected to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that keeping the polls open until 8 p.m. affords the many tens of thousands of Australians who spend their Saturday afternoons in various sporting activities an opportunity to go to the polls without the <span class="highlight">race</span> to get there before 6 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It appears from the report that instructions to the representatives of this company are that white Australians of European origin may be insured for up to $35,000 without medical examination but that a medical examination is required in all cases where the applicant is a person who is not of British parentage and has resided in Australia for less than 2 years, or is a full, half or quarter caste Chinese, Indian, etc., that is, a person other than of the European <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One which is called ‘<span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations in Britain’ is published by the Reference Division of the Central Office of Information in London, and it was published in October 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They also show that this discrimination is more related to <span class="highlight">race</span> than to foreign origin, since the level of discrimination against Italians or Greeks is comparatively low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When they were in Opposition I can recall how they constantly, in this chamber and outside it- certainly, from my recollection, in this chamber- accused the Government of being racist because of conduct in which it was alleged to have engaged when those of us in government who were responsible for the decisions which were being taken knew that there was not a spark of racism or <span class="highlight">race</span> relations in that conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is discrimination because of sex, age, <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, religious or political beliefs, an accident of birth, or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms as set out in this Part, without any distinction of any kind, such as <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Bill comes up for debate in the very near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The beauty of the human <span class="highlight">race</span> is that we are all different- one from the other- black, white, red, yellow or brindle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only nature could alford to play the genetic lottery on such a massive scale and with such huge losses and wind up with 3 billion people on this planet, each of whom is unique and different from every other one no matter what the person’s religion, <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national origin or sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from eliminating racial discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official <span class="highlight">race</span> relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be headed by a <span class="highlight">race</span> relations commissioner with the status of a High Court judge and with powers similar to those used in the Spanish Inquisition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any objection would be stifled by the <span class="highlight">race</span> relations commissioner while complaints would be deterred by the magnitude of the fine -between $2,000 and $5,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia scores another first as being the only nation in the modern world to succeed in exterminating a distinct <span class="highlight">race</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be said that our inaction was fostered by a lack of information or by mistaken information in respect of matters of <span class="highlight">race</span> which had fostered intolerance and ignorance for the 200 years that we have held this continent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These views are inaccurate, in my opinion, and are not based on evidence and are misleading in that they attempt to attribute to a <span class="highlight">race</span> an effect which excessive drinking would have on any <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be the height of hypocrisy for white Australians now to say to Aborigines that from here on the <span class="highlight">race</span> must be on equal terms, without taking into account the 180 years start which white Australians have given themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will become possible now for those public officials to be charged with discrimination if they persist in their unfair and discriminatory practices which are synoymous with the activities of certain policemen in the Redfern area, activities have been noted by lawyers of substance in the region, activities which are continuing to this very day to the everlasting disgrace of sections of the New South Wales police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is one of the companies that have the temerity to challenge the established and declared policy as enunciated in the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  on 2 occasions that we shall establish an Australian Government Insurance Office in which there shall be no discrimination on sex, <span class="highlight">race</span> or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable senators opposite say that they believe therefore that racism did not have its origins in the superior <span class="highlight">race</span> theories of Adolf Hitler and in some of those racist groups that operate within the United States which clearly are gaining in influence within our own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Substantially the Bill seeks to re-educate the Australian people, to bring about the understanding that all men are brothers and that <span class="highlight">race</span> is not a question that ought to divide us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the word ‘<span class="highlight">race</span>’ was largely derived from the works of Georges Buffon, the French naturalist, scientist and author of the voluminous ‘Histoire Naturelle’ which was published in the 1 8th century- I believe between 1750 and 1800. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that the word ‘<span class="highlight">race</span>’, with all its added emotional connotations, has helped to create the racist myth which has in turn inspired the bizarre form of political racism which the world has seen during this century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personally, I define ‘racial discrimination’ as an expression of malice towards any human being because of his <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The anti-racist, psuedo moralists of today who seem to be obsessed by <span class="highlight">race</span> as the all important issue and who try to convince us that <span class="highlight">race</span> is what it is all about are, I feel, leading us astray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To blame everything on <span class="highlight">race</span> is a cheap excuse and an evasion of personal responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, something can be done about economics, education, culture, skills and so on but no one can change his or her <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that conciliation and education, which I see as the prime tasks of the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner will have far more effect than the form of judicial action which may be taken by him in accordance with the proposals of the Bill which is at present before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was the word class ‘ left out of clause 9 of the Bill when it mentions acts ‘involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedon in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life ‘? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as soon as we want to combat discrimination on the basis of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin and class, we should adhere to the great tradition of this country that a person is innocent unless proven guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that the world is one <span class="highlight">race</span> but the modern attitude of the so-called intelligentsia in many instances is leading to the promotion of the idea that all animosities between people are genetically based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The New School- the Nouvelle Ecole- founded on evolution, is committed to playing out 2 theses of neo-Darwinism and polygenesis and to underlining the inequalities and the profound differences which are alleged to exist between the races and to translating various degrees of evolution in the transforming movement of these races towards new species ‘between which unions will probably be no longer be fertile’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of those basic principles is that racial discrimination should be proscribed by law and that fundamental rights should be guaranteed without distinction as to <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The British <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board is required to make a judgement of the issues between the parties but it has no power to compulsorily acquire evidence as this Bill now before the Senate provides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this legislation has any strong relationship with that of other countries, it is clearly with that of the provinces of Canada and not with the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But even in England, where the Board is said not to have had a great deal of success, I noted when I was there in 1973 that there was a big debate about the activities of the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board, not directed at the existence of the Board but at whether certain machinery provisions under the Act could be changed, and whether they were working as well as they might. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope to have a law through the Commonwealth Parliament which will supersede State laws and make it an offence throughout Australia to discriminate on the ground of <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When people have something of another <span class="highlight">race</span> in them, no longer, in my mind, do they belong to the <span class="highlight">race</span> from which they may have stemmed, so the sooner we wake up to this sort of nonsense the better for this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise that it is often most difficult to establish discrimination on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or ethnic grounds, and of course there is always the risk of creating the converse situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not quote the story of Boswell and  Dr Johnson  on this because it would immediately arouse a little bit of enmity around the place, but the fact is that according to  Senator Gietzelt,  this has become a poem of some import apparently because  Mrs Walker  happens to belong to the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We give the ground away, not on the basis that we are ashamed in any way, but simply on the argument that I first adduced, namely, that you cannot eliminate discrimination on the ground of religion, <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or anything else except if it is done by an educated society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have obtained a copy of a monograph by someone in the United Kingdom in relation to <span class="highlight">race</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is probably a bit out of date, but on page 128 it mentions the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board in England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The monograph which I have mentioned, referring to the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board in England, states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Act seems to have been effective in reducing discrimination in public houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board and its committees found 23 cases of racial discrimination concerning public houses in 1970-71 and in twenty-two of those cases conciliation was successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Sheil  offered the opinion that countries which have laws pertaining to <span class="highlight">race</span> generally have more racial problems than countries which do not have laws pertaining to <span class="highlight">race</span>, a view which he subsequently contradicted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us would have had complaints that this Bill would encourage pimping, and there was the possibility, I think, as the clauses were originally worded, that one could have an anonymous informant and a person could be hauled before the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner without knowing who his accuser was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I speak of discrimination I simply mean that a large number of people are treated not because of what they are but because of their racial heritage- because their parents were Aboriginal, Greek, or of some other <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my professional life I came across a consistent series of examples of discrimination on the grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span> that I found highly objectionable, and on many occasions the law did not provide an adequate remedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have said is that a person who believes that he has been offended by somebody who has done something which is illegal under these provisions should not go to court but to the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the situation is that whenever somebody feels aggrieved under the provisions of the Bill, his recourse is to go to the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner who can bring the parties together and attempt to conciliate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner out of the civil proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Government that if it wants the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner to be accepted as a genuine educator and conciliator, it ought not to permit him to be involved in litigation because again my rather short experience as a lawyer- it is short compared with that of many lawyers in this chamber- has convinced me that when you go to law and you go into court and you have lawyers on each side attitudes harden and very seldom do you get a solution which leaves both sides satisfied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those people who are actively discriminating on the ground of <span class="highlight">race</span> see that the whole of the Parliament is united in this declaration that racial discrimination should be unlawful, I believe some will lose heart at least to some extent and cease the sort of campaign that I think has been offensive to most of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only do I represent what is possibly the most deprived section of our community; I come from the only State that has made it an offence to discriminate against people on the score of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or creed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A person shall not, with intent to promote hostility or illwill against, or to bring into contempt or ridicule, persons included in a group of persons in Australia by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin of the persons included in that group- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole question is that a person may still publish literature and talk about the black <span class="highlight">race</span>, the yellow <span class="highlight">race</span>, or any other <span class="highlight">race</span> and possibly show his attitude to these people, but it is a matter of whether his intention is to promote hostility or ill will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether  Senator Chaney,  on reflection, would say that there was anything wrong in regard to anyone who purposely set out to create the hostility and ill will against anyone by virtue of the fact that that person happened to be of a different <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation will not cure racism but at least it will give the opportunity for some attempt to be made to police it and to make it a breach when there is information that an action was taken which was detrimental to an individual only on the score of his <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result of our democratic rights, we are a <span class="highlight">race</span> which is inclined to discriminate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw this thing to its natural conclusion: People who are of a different <span class="highlight">race</span> and who are dissatisfied with their lot in life, could quite likely present a case to the Commissioner because they were perhaps unsuccessful in obtaining employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That person, of a different racial origin, would come to the conclusion: ‘I was not employed because I was of a different <span class="highlight">race</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commissioner would receive all day, every day complaints from people who had been discriminated against, but not by reason of their <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 9 states:  lt is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The German <span class="highlight">race</span> is very prominent in that connection in my area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I honestly think that this legislation could be the means of insulting that section of the new races we have in Australia because it implies racial discrimination in an area in which I think it does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have seen extracts from the book ‘Voices From Other Cultures’ in which it is stated that an officer of the Aboriginal Medical Service was asked to leave a restaurant because people of her <span class="highlight">race</span> had caused trouble there previously and that the officer, who was with companions, felt humiliated because she was being victimised or discriminated against somewhat in being asked to leave because of what someone of her colour had done in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of these many-sided facets determine the status of a person in our community whatever his <span class="highlight">race</span>, whatever his origin or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill makes it unlawful for a person to do an act- I am looking very broadly at the Schedule which is contained in the Bill- involving discrimination based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent and national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference, based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The African slave era developed theories that there were differences between races, differences in habits, attitudes and beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later there were claims to justify racism on the ground that certain people were a deviation from what was then called the white norm of the human <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst legislation may seek to guard against complaints it may well be, as we look at this Bill, that we are seeing the development of what I will call a <span class="highlight">race</span> relations business with a whole range of staffs seeking to justify their existence in earning their living through the investigation of complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill concerns racial discrimination in the broad sense in which it is interpreted in Article 1 of the Convention, namely, distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based upon <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is not in the narrow sense a mere matter of <span class="highlight">race</span> but relates to those matters of prejudice which we know follow together in those various contexts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the meaning of that is that some are inferior and some are to be regarded as such because of their colour or <span class="highlight">race</span>, I reject that proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will now read in this context a statement which was made on the nature of <span class="highlight">race</span> and racial differences by a group of scientists, composed of physical anthropologists and geneticists, convened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in June 1951. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In matters of <span class="highlight">race</span>, the only characteristics which anthropologists have so far been able to use effectively as a basis for classification are physical (anatomical and physiological). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement goes on to say that within a single <span class="highlight">race</span> there are vast differences between people and that social changes occur without any necessary connection with <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from eliminating racial discrimination by making it illegal, the Bill will highlight the problems between the races and create an official <span class="highlight">race</span> relations industry with a staff of dedicated anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint in much the same way as does the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They do not realise that someone has chosen someone else instead of them for a job on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is the provisions in the Bill that allow the Commissioner of <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations not only to conciliate but also to proceed then to gather evidence by an unusual method and then to proceed to institute proceedings at law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some refer to the ‘<span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Bill’- they do not even get the name of the Bill right- and urge not the amendment of the Bill but the removal of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is cooked up ostensibly to protect Aborigines and other ethnic groups from so-called ‘ <span class="highlight">race</span> hatred ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This evening I have mixed feelings to some extent because I have travelled and have seen what has happened to members of my <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps if there is a law which says that we cannot discriminate against people some hope and some dignity will be given back to members of my <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of past discrimination and things that have happened in the past, a group of young Aboriginal men and women could become angry, and outside this place they could shout, ‘Down with the whitey ‘, or something about some <span class="highlight">race</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to add a little which I believe has not so far been adverted to in the debate in relation to the experience of the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is of some interest to note that in the calendar year 1972 a total of 908 complaints were made to the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board and that the Board formed the opinion that there had been some discrimination in 181 of those cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Table 9 of the 1972 report of the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board in the United Kingdom shows the completed cases for the period 1968 to 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That has been my reservation about this legislation- not in any way in relation to the objective which is attempted to be achieved but to the mode of approach and whether you are not better to view all citizens in Australia as being entitled to certain rights and certain protection by law, whether they are of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, of a particular religion, or of a background or origin which may mark them as a minority group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to Article 4 which provides that adherents to the Convention are to ‘condemn all propaganda and all organisations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one <span class="highlight">race</span> or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under Article 5 of the Convention there is an undertaking to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of certain specified rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We consider that to introduce the criminal law into this area would be wrong because it would only serve to exacerbate tensions that underlie <span class="highlight">race</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I want to know as a layman, having listened to 3 eminent legal senators, is this: Does the owner of the hotel, the restaurant or any place that serves or treats other people have to have in writing or recorded on a tape instructions to his staff that they must not take this attitude to people of another <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, clime or religion, if he is to have the onus of proof as his safeguard? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A reference in this Parliament to the doing of an act by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin of a person includes a reference to the doing of an act for two or more reasons that include the first-mentioned reason, whether or not that reason is the dominant reason for the doing of the act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That means that if there are a number of reasons for the doing of an act, each contributing to the reason that an act has been done or the reason that there has been a failure to do something which ought to have been done, and if one of those reasons happens to be the fact that you object to a person’s <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin, then that is sufficient to render responsible the person who did the act or committed the omission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-To take up  Senator Cavanagh  ‘s interjection, if there is also an objection possibly that people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span> are reputed to be credit risks, then that creates another reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the clause as it stands it is immaterial that the reason of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, nationality or ethnic origin is not the dominant reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that that Act required a complainant to show that the discrimination occurred by reason only of <span class="highlight">race</span>, country of origin or colour of the skin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is considered a wishy-washy point to make, I would refer to the sort of statistics quoted by  Senator Rae  in the second reading debate and to the statistics of the English <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commission which indicate that in that country, at least, a large number of cases are brought which are found not to be based on racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board in Great Britain has the power to institute litigation in the way we are suggesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The counterpart of that Board, that is the Commissioner for <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations, should have similar power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner who has certain functions and then later in the Bill there is provision for a Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his speech in the second reading debate,  Senator Greenwood  made some play of what he called the ineffectiveness of British legislation dealing with <span class="highlight">race</span> relations and I must confess that he made his point with some cogency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A person shall not, with intent to promote hostility or illwill against, or to bring into contempt or ridicule, persons included in a group of persons in Australia by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin of the persons included in that group- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are opposed to the publishing of written material which preaches superiority of persons of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span> and so on and which encourages hatred of people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The facts are that the world is one <span class="highlight">race</span> but the modern attitude of the so-called intelligentsia in many instances is leading to the promotion of the idea that all animosities between people are genetically based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do we regard it just as a matter of <span class="highlight">race</span> and colour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that people of one coloured <span class="highlight">race</span> often criticise people of another coloured <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone, whatever his <span class="highlight">race</span>, is proud of his <span class="highlight">race</span> and naturally is suspicious of people of other races. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that this yacht is the only Australian entrant in the London ‘Financial Times’ Clipper <span class="highlight">Race</span> to be conducted in August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed by a prominent yachting man from South Australia that in order to participate in this <span class="highlight">race</span> it is necessary for this vessel to be equipped with a world range radio transmitter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that as this <span class="highlight">race</span> has the blessing of the Australian Yachting Federation the Government ought to give some consideration to providing what appears to me to be a very insignificant sum of money so that Australia can be represented in this world recognised <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Being a courageous person, he intends to go to London for this <span class="highlight">race</span> and join the yacht, which will be sailing from Adelaide, I believe, on Sunday 15 June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the Minister is a man interested in sporting activities, and I believe that he is also one who would recognise the importance of having Australia represented in this <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggested that in order to compete in the <span class="highlight">race</span> it would be necessary for the vessel to be equipped with a world-range transmitter, ranging from 2 to 18 megahertz, I think he said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a direct result of this Government’s restructuring of the economy in favour of government enterprise, if one can call it that, and opposed to private enterprise we are breeding a <span class="highlight">race</span> of bludgers and parasites who are waiting on government handouts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister cause investigation of this incident which appears to be in breach of section 1b of the International Labor Organisation Convention to which Australia is a signatory and which renounces all forms of discrimination in employment based,  inter alia,  on <span class="highlight">race</span>, sex, religion and politics? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I knew that a motion had been moved in another place and I wanted personally to pay this tribute to the great leader of this very fine <span class="highlight">race</span> of people, the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latter, for political reasons, have attempted to project the image that Aborigines are a homogeneous <span class="highlight">race</span>- a fact which is vigorously disputed by the cultural Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Party is not against the principle of granting land to the Aboriginal people, yet at the same time we are vitally concerned that such legislation be implemented to the satisfaction of all Territorians without being at the expense of one or the other <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be more concise, we must look closely at the intricate issues involved in granting Aboriginal land rights in order to ensure that those rights are not abused by either <span class="highlight">race</span> and also to ensure that their sole basis is not the overemphasis which is so often placed on theorist ideals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Soviet’s real objective, should the West respond, is to arouse the non-aligned nations to the dangers of a naval <span class="highlight">race</span> and so create a hostile climate for the United States and European countries, and perhaps even ourselves, if they seek to counter this Russian presence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that one would have to be the most avid racegoer and fanatical follower of the sport of kings to judge in which order one wanted all the horses in the Melbourne Cup to finish, especially if there are 40 or 50 horses running, and then, having determined the order of all the horses, to expect one to make a book on the whole <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President Sukarno went on to observe that the nations participating, however, were united by more important things than their superficial divisions- he was talking of colour and <span class="highlight">race</span>- and notably the common detestation of colonisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me, and I am sure to many people of my <span class="highlight">race</span>, this is perhaps one of the most exciting and most important measures ever taken with regard to the education of Aboriginal children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To endeavour and encourage a continuous voluntary association of residents of Doonside and those of neighbourhood either Australian Citizens by birth or naturalisation or citizens to be, and to promote thereby a realistic process of integration based upon pursuit of mutual interests, direct social relations without discrimination resulting from origin, <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or political beliefs. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Integration implies that the white <span class="highlight">race</span> is going to absorb the Aboriginal people and that is not going to be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in a <span class="highlight">race</span> for survival in the world markets and we are playing in a game where the winner takes all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe this is being taken into account by many of those people who criticise the Government for what it is doing for Aborigines because, as I understand it, we have one of the highest birth rates of any <span class="highlight">race</span> in this country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Act has a more general application to discrimination based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, and makes it unlawful for a person to do an act involving racial discrimination which impairs the enjoyment, on an equal footing of fundamental rights and freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act also contains provision which guarantees equality before the law in the enjoyment of rights without discrimination based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, and which are designed to supersede State or Commonwealth laws that discriminate on ground of <span class="highlight">race</span> in relation to the enjoyment or rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760817_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is so because it is not until we as Australians come to accept the problems of minority groups living by different historic cultural values that better <span class="highlight">race</span> relationships can be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, both Acts forbid extradition where there are substantial grounds for believing that the alleged offender might be prejudiced at his trial in the foreign state by reason of his <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion, nationality or political opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All the psychological sets of the personality were smashed so that Aborigines could not identify except with shame, embarrassment and cringing at the thought of the once valued images, the ideas that once programmed their personal, social and <span class="highlight">race</span> identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that general support of its intentions by the Labor Party could bring about a revitalisation of our community and a pause in our rate of inflation so that we can catch up again in a <span class="highlight">race</span> that I am afraid we are all too good at winning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the latest <span class="highlight">race</span> violence in Soweto and other parts of South Africa and also in view of Australia’s known and accepted antiapartheid policy, can the Minister inform the Parliament whether Qantas Airways Ltd will be carrying the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team from South Africa to Australia, leaving Johannesburg on or about 1 9 September and arriving in Sydney on or about 23 September? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the undoubted success of this scheme, can the Minister give an assurance that further such units will be set up to deal with this disease, which is peculiar to my <span class="highlight">race</span>, in all other remote areas of Australia where the density of Aboriginal population warrants it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason why that single child was attending school was that both its parents had a certain minimal level of education, and they were of the few, as far as I could gather, of their <span class="highlight">race</span> who still believed that education for their children meant something for the future of the childrenthe opportunity of a decent life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It comes through loud and clear in the whole area of Aboriginal policy in Australia that the Aboriginal people need leaders of their own <span class="highlight">race</span>, people who understand the problems of their own <span class="highlight">race</span>, who can communicate to them and who, through their own success or whatever it is that moves that <span class="highlight">race</span>, can motivate them to try to lift themselves to basic standards of decency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to state categorically something I have stated many times over the years since I have been a senator I see my responsibilities as a senator representing the State of Queensland, first and foremost to God, secondly to my nation, thirdly to my State and fourthly to my Party, but interwoven through this sequence is my love of <span class="highlight">race</span> and my burning desire to do whatever I possibly can to advance the cause of my own <span class="highlight">race</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this connection, I add that it is not proposed that a deduction will be available in respect of the cost of <span class="highlight">race</span> horses and other animals used or bred for sporting or domestic purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the matters that he must take into account is that both extradition Acts forbid extradition where there are substantial grounds for believing the alleged offender may be prejudiced at his trial in the foreign state by reason of his <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion, nationality or political opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, there is continual pressure not only from within Australia but from outside to reduce defence expenditure as a contributing factor to the lessening of the arms <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These facts show that there are excessive costs because of the problems of industrial unrest, a lack of productivity, the wages <span class="highlight">race</span> that has gone on for quite some time and absenteeism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any opportunity to overcome the deprivation, the poverty, the disease and the squalor around this world that I mentioned a moment ago is beset by the great arms <span class="highlight">race</span> which a large number of countries have joined post 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt many honourable senators in this chamber have heard the comment that perhaps the world is lucky that Russia and China today do not see eye to eye; that it could be the saving grace ofthe world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In theory it is an excellent idea to support the initiatives to lower the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> in this area but in reality such a move could be accepted as appeasement and appeasement has never operated successfully because the end result is that there is one dominant power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Australia- a country rich in food, minerals, energy, space; a country far removed geographically from other developed countries; a sparsely populated country; a country with a black minority- is to move successfully through a quarter century in which issues of resources, economic inequality, food, <span class="highlight">race</span>, population are going to assume an unprecedented importance, then it is essential that the Australian people as a whole become involved in and informed about the process of shaping our foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been in this Senate for only a year and  Senator Bonner  has been here for a much longer period, but I believe that he has been a most suitable representative of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> of Australia and I think that they are very fortunate to have him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is rather invidious to look at the  precentage  of blood of one <span class="highlight">race</span> or another in a person’s veins and say whether that person is of one particular <span class="highlight">race</span> or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and  unbreathed,  that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, where that immortal garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that charity begins where there is the greatest need for it and we have sufficient wealth in our country to satisfy the problems of Australia, assuming we do not set our goals too high; but so many other nations comprising probably one-third of the human <span class="highlight">race</span> have little prospects other than poverty and almost hopelessness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must understand that what we have been doing over the decades- indeed the centuries- however unwittingly, has been to produce a serious loss of dignity, a loss of significance and a loss of ability to cope in a <span class="highlight">race</span> of people who, over the millennia, showed a miraculous ability to cope, remarkable dignity and very rich cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For far too long Australians have had to put up with motor cars with poor handling characteristics; which are unsafe at any speed in a moment of crisis; which are especially fast on the open highways and especially dangerous on our open highways; and designed to <span class="highlight">race</span> from one set of traffic lights to another set of traffic lights at high speed and to come to a sudden halt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to say in this chamber tonight that whilst I am very conscious of my responsibilities, which embrace all the people in Queensland and all the people in Australia, I believe that interwoven with those responsibilites is my love of <span class="highlight">race</span> and my burning desire to do whatever I can to ease the lot of my Aboriginal fellows and to do whatever I possibly can to improve the conditions under which my fellow Aborigines live at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So I intend, for a short time, to speak about matters that concern the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As an Aboriginal he ought not to need reminding of how little was done to improve the conditions of his <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it believed that a <span class="highlight">race</span> of people which had been discriminated against for so long should be discriminated for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that he is not the only one of the Aboriginal community who seeks power and prestige by exploiting the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> and using his Aboriginal origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> is deserving of assistance and support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Republic of South Africa remains a threat to world peace insofar as it is surrounded by countries which have black African populations that are not prepared to tolerate the continued suppression of people of their own <span class="highlight">race</span> living only a few hundreds of miles away across the border. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said at the founding conference of the Progressive Federal Party, held last month in Johannesburg, that ‘there was no greater priority in South Africa ‘s politics than the banishment of <span class="highlight">race</span> and colour discrimination’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the white man is in greater need of liberation, in greater need to be freed from fear and liberated from the threat which <span class="highlight">race</span> and colour discrimination is to our future safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He needs to be liberated from the blot that <span class="highlight">race</span> discrimination is on the name of our country, from the burden it is on our conscience and the curse it will be on our children. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was no greater priority in South Africa’s politics than the banishment of <span class="highlight">race</span> and colour discrimination,  Mr  Basson  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On Sunday the bible belters will get up and preach ‘thou shalt’ and ‘thou shalt not’, but they can justify the fact that a <span class="highlight">race</span> of people were obliterated because those people were inconvenient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that  Senator Bonner,  as a representative of his <span class="highlight">race</span>, had to raise this matter in the Senate indicates how hopelessly backward this Government is in regard to the needs of this day and age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a provision would be completely in conflict with Australian policies, particularly the immigration policies which are administered without discrimination as to <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government had waited until May to hold the forthcoming election it would not have had to <span class="highlight">race</span> around, causing terrible upheaval, because of the time limits imposed by that election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know there are people on the other side who deny that these people have rights as the original owners of this country, but let us not forget that our <span class="highlight">race</span> bashed them, burnt them, raped them, murdered them, tortured them, poisoned them, starved them, cheated them, denied them education- it still does- denied them good health- it still does- and destroyed or commercialised their places of religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any special measures taken for Aborigines or partAborigines are regarded as temporary measures, not based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, but intended to meet the need for special care and assistance to protect them from any ill-effects of sudden change and to assist them to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will be favourable to their social, economic and political advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For reasons which go through my whole attitude to this question of <span class="highlight">race</span>- I believe that to have a good community we need to have good co-operative relations- I say very firmly to the Opposition and to the National Aboriginal Conference that they should not advocate that sort of drastic action at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had the power to make laws for the good government of the people of any <span class="highlight">race</span> except the Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was believed that any special laws would be a restriction upon people of a special <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the referendum in 1967 and despite the fact that it was fought on the ground of a better go for Aborigines, we deleted the words ‘other than the aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> in any State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we have power to make laws for the good government of the people of any <span class="highlight">race</span> for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One legal opinion I have seen assumes that the High Court could well rule that Aborigines are not people of a special <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of the Constitution is to restrict the power of the Commonwealth to make a uniform law for its citizens- that is, for Australians if that term can be denned- and another law, a separate law, for people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he a person of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no use saying that the people gave the Parliament power to make laws in respect of Aboriginals in 1967; the Parliament has the power to make special laws in respect of people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the latest edition of their publication,  The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth,  Quick and Garran, in dealing with people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsection can only exclude the action of State legislation respecting ‘the people of any <span class="highlight">race</span>’, when the Federal Parliament declares, by legislation, that such <span class="highlight">race</span> is a <span class="highlight">race</span> for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before such legislation the State Parliaments will be free to pass laws concerning any part of their resident population, including the people of any particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, coloured or otherwise, but as soon as the Federal Parliament by legislative intervention has shown that it has dealt with, or contemplates dealing with, the people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span> by special laws, the power to discriminate in respect of that <span class="highlight">race</span> will thenceforth be exclusively vested in it and the State legislatures  Wili  be deprived of jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even contemplates dealing with-  the people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span> by special laws, the power to discriminate in respect of that <span class="highlight">race</span> will thenceforth bc exclusively vested in it and the State legislatures will be deprived of jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Federal Parliament showed its intention to make special laws for people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, namely, the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Anti-Discriminatory (Queensland Laws) Act, under which we decided to accept Aborigines as people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, is a valid law, then the laws which Bjelke-Petersen is operating today are not valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to make special laws for people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only power is the power to legislate for people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst 1 do not think that the Australian publicwould give the Commonwealth Parliament power to acquire land for all people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>, I am certain that if all parties supported an appeal to the Australian public to allow it to alter the Constitution sufficiently to let the Government legislate to give land to Aboriginal people there would be a successful result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should I enter this rat <span class="highlight">race</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discrimination against <span class="highlight">race</span> is despicable and is to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I said at Question Time, that is, the Government deplores discrimination in any context on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or for any other reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore Australia and the other countries using the air space have to fly over countries whose policies, whether of <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or otherwise, they certainly would not support and not condone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to <span class="highlight">race</span>, sex, language, or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It constitutes a discrimination not only against religion, not only against <span class="highlight">race</span>, but also against nationality- all three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should stand up, seek out the other countries which are signatories to this United Nations Charter and make them put their money where their mouth is and stand up for what they believe, if they really believe that there should be no discrimination as to <span class="highlight">race</span>, sex, language or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the many years that I have been privileged to sit in this chamber, I have listened attentively, if somewhat cynically, to the many debates concerning my <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that perhaps I have traversed this ground before, and although it needs to be reiterated time and time again, perhaps I can condense this with the words of two white scholars to whom my <span class="highlight">race</span> will be eternally grateful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the present Government made it clear that it was not tolerant of distinctions on the grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span> or religion and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, South African Airways has notified the Department- I think that was the morning after  Senator O  ‘Byrne’s question-that it has never refused to carry passengers from Australia on the grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All South African Airways passengers are treated equally regardless of <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, in fact, the complainant has said that he did not make inquiries as to why he was excluded, then automatically to assume that he has been excluded on a basis of <span class="highlight">race</span> and to make public accusations to that effect is perhaps a little unwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Health aware of media reports that a super-international horse <span class="highlight">race</span> is being planned for Flemington in early 1980, in which overseas horses are expected to take part? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister for Health is aware of the proposal being put forward by certain Victorian racing interests that an international horse <span class="highlight">race</span> be planned for the early 1980s, in which overseas horses would be invited to take part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Government to the proposed <span class="highlight">race</span> is that horses imported to Australia would be required to comply with normal quarantine requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an endeavour to untangle and clarify what has become a very muddled situation, the Committee ‘s report does four things: First of all, it gives a detailed analysis, for really the first time in the legal literature, of the nature, scope and extent of section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution, which of course empowers the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to the people of any <span class="highlight">race</span> for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, he has had the ability to stand up for his <span class="highlight">race</span> and, I believe, to lead them to the fine and honourable decision which has taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just lately, at the same time as this Government was announcing that it had initialled an agreement to sell uranium to South Korea, the South Korean Press came out and pointed out that South Korea had the equipment, it had the warheads and it had the equipment to transport the warheads; and that all it needed was the nuclear warheads and it was then in the <span class="highlight">race</span> with other larger and stronger powers in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I realise now that the continuation of this dangerous industry all over the world can be only fraught with danger and apprehension for the whole of the human <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What value has it got to the human <span class="highlight">race</span> if it does not do that? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These countries arose as a result of a conference in Berlin about 100 years ago, when there was a <span class="highlight">race</span> by the European powers to settle Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We made no effort to apply the sort of pressure that should have been applied to both countries to ensure a dramatic change in their <span class="highlight">race</span> relations policies, policies which to varying degrees have been cruelly oppressive of the great mass of their people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a suggestion were sought of me by  Senator Baume  concerning Africa, I would say that … we made no effort to apply the sort of pressure that should have been applied to both countries to ensure a dramatic change in their <span class="highlight">race</span> relations policies, policies which to varying degrees have been cruelly oppressive of the great mass of their people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their reaction, of course, is to engage in an arms <span class="highlight">race</span> to match the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to quote four examples from the references that were made by the Commissioner as an illustration of a lack of <span class="highlight">race</span> relations in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In compliance with the fundamental obligations laid down in article 2 of this Convention, States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that a new series of initiatives is required, if equality for all people, regardless of their <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour, is to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet today Opposition speakers have sought to drag forward this most unfortunate example of the misuse of a person’s <span class="highlight">race</span> or description. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first thing the report does is make a quite detailed analysis of section 5 1 (xxvi) of the Constitution, the Commonwealth’s power to make laws with respect to people of any <span class="highlight">race</span> for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws, a provision which assumed that form as a result of the 1 967 Aboriginal powers referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I last spoke on this question, I expressed considerable doubt whether the High Court would uphold the point that the Commonwealth had power to acquire land for the settlement of people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is: What are the people of any <span class="highlight">race</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee next refers to the question of <span class="highlight">race</span> and asks: Who are the people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It asks whether they are part Aboriginal, quarter-cast Aboriginal and whether a person who has only one-eighth Aboriginal blood can be classed as being of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee refers to Parliament’s powers under the definition of special laws and questions whether Parliament is restricted from making particular laws for one <span class="highlight">race</span> of people which may be contrary to the rights given in law to another <span class="highlight">race</span> of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the conclusion of the Committee is that Parliament has the power to make special laws, whatever that may mean, for the people of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> and those laws need not be ones that we would normally make for the balance of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Mining Industry Council puts forward the pathetic plea that Australia should have a law for all Australians, not a separate law for people of a particular <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council forgets the fact that the Australian public voted in 1967, by an overwhelming majority, that there should be special laws for people of particular races, and this included the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of any <span class="highlight">race</span>, other than the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that referendum people voted for the Commonwealth to be able to make laws with respect to people of any <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s land mass  should be alienated for special groups, whether they are Aboriginals or of any other <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of the particular issue, the circumstances demonstrate that unless the level of distrust between nations is lowered, even minor matters can lead to another outbreak in the arms <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already referred to the resolution of the 33rd session of the General Assembly which called for the dissemination of information and for the organisation of symposiums, meetings, conferences et cetera, to expose the danger of the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> and to increase public understanding of the urgent tasks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>compared to the risks of not disarming, the risks of sitting on your hands’, of drifting on with the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> and the so-called balance of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like a juggernaut defying all attempts to control it, the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> today continues with mounting speed and intensity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States Senate,  Senator Mark  Hatfield said that SALT was another one of those escalating steps in the nuclear arms <span class="highlight">race</span> which would stimulate production of new weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States and the Soviet Union would <span class="highlight">race</span> to reach the maximum levels of nuclear weapons allowed under the Treaty, including missiles suitable for destroying the other nation’s offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This threat would prompt the Soviets to take counter measures, escalating the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> to still more dangerous levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Something like $ 1 m is spent every minute on the arms <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In individual countries the percentage diversion is mostly in the 2 per cent to 8 per cent bracket, although in some cases there are expenditures ranging from one per cent to 30 per cent of the gross national product on the arms <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us consider the connection between the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> and poverty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arms <span class="highlight">race</span>, with its economic cost and social and political effects, nationally and internationally, constitutes an important obstacle to effective progress in establishing a new international economic order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resources now being absorbed by the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> are scarce and are needed for socially constructive ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite apart from other economic problems the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On several occasions it has been seen how the public, when adequately informed, can exercise a moderating influence on developments in the field of armaments, and fostering a genuine and widespread public concern about the dangers of the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> may be one of the most important ways of giving a new momentum to efforts towards disarmament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me sustain that argument in this way: The arms <span class="highlight">race</span> is fundamentally inflationary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is patently obvious that what is happening in this respect is not in the interests of the human <span class="highlight">race</span> and its survival. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Noting that, while millions starve, expenditure on the arms <span class="highlight">race</span> is $ 1 , 000m per day for the World, and $7m per day for Australia; and noting that the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has listed ‘peace and disarmament’ as a theme for the International Year of the Child; and further noting that a reduction in expenditure on arms could contribute in both developed and developing countries to the eradication of hunger and disease and to the provision of more adequate housing, education, health services, economic security and social welfare for all people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-1-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>abroad by racial group; the percentage of respondents perceiving different problems as very important or important by country of origin; the long-run migration plans by country of origin and <span class="highlight">race</span>; the indices of return for majorityminority groups by country of origin; and the index of return by sponsorship, scholarship, source of financial support, bound bond job guarantee student. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy made a link with the future leaders of Asia and was inherently right in itself in the sense that tertiary education was made free from January 1974, regardless of <span class="highlight">race</span>, and won Australia a great deal of goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The propaganda attack on this country is for <span class="highlight">race</span> bias. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The participating States will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to <span class="highlight">race</span>, sex, language or religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the situation in New Zealand, one finds that the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commissioner,  Mr H.  L. Dansey, is a Human Rights Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New Zealand one man deals with <span class="highlight">race</span> relations- a very important part of human rights in New Zealand- yet at the same time he is a commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out that quite curiously there is such a difference between what we are proposing to do in Australia where  Dr Grassby,  the Commissioner for Community Relations, is not to be a member of the Human Rights Commission, and the position in New Zealand where the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Commmissioner,  Mr H.  L. Dansey, is of course a Human Rights Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Committee in Townsville said in its telegram today: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previous article ‘The Real Story Behind WA’s <span class="highlight">Race</span> Riots’ the Bulletin 9 October 1979 equally offensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deeply offended by tenor of the Bulletin’s articles 9 October, 13 November 1979 “The Real Story Behind Western Australia’s <span class="highlight">Race</span> Riots’ and ‘A Happy Story About Aborigines’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One eminent jurist has advised the Commissioner that provisions of the Act, including certain prohibition provisions, cannot be supported by Commonwealth constitutional powers since they are not directed to people of a specific <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those rights can be abrogated provided that such measures are not inconsistent with other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, sex, language or social origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 2, for instance, would commit us to ensuring that everyone enjoys the rights laid down without distinction of any kind, such as <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can also agree, as has been said today and as was said last week, that human rights are indivisible and should be the same for men and women, black and white, child and adult, whatever one’s <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or social or national origin may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have, it claims, the right to affection, love and understanding; to adequate nutrition, medical care and free education; to full opportunity for play and recreation; to a name and nationality; to special care if handicapped; to be the first to receive relief in times of disaster; to learn to be a useful member of society; to develop individual abilities; to be brought up in a spirit of peace and universal brotherhood; and to enjoy all of those rights regardless of <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion, colour, sex and national or social origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tenth suggested right is the right to enjoy all of the foregoing rights irrespective of <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion, colour, creed and national or social origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 55 of the Charter binds all members to the principle of equal rights, self-determination of peoples, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion, sex or language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a number of honourable senators have said, that is an extraordinary anomaly, especially when one bears in mind that in New Zealand, where there is a <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Conciliator, the Conciliator is one of the human rights commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless,  Mr Dancey  the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Conciliator, is a member of the Human Rights Commission there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are to have a situation in which <span class="highlight">race</span> relations in Australia will be severely strained not only, as I have said, by the increasing education of the Aboriginal population but also by the increasing number of Vietnamese refugees and the increasing tensions in the employment situation in this country, the Commissioner for Community Relations ought to be one of the members of the Human Rights Commission, one among many and an equal among many. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, I now have an adopted child of mixed <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It happens because he is the only child at that school of a different colour, not so much because he is of a different <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There certainly are a vast number of different interest groups involved in the area in which this Commission will be concerned and not just in the area of discrimination on the grounds of sex, <span class="highlight">race</span>, religion or handicaps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Kampuchea we saw not only a devastated country but also a devastated <span class="highlight">race</span>, a devastated civilisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever we can do as Australians, as very wealthy individuals in a very rich country, to alleviate the extraordinary suffering and devastation that that <span class="highlight">race</span> and country have undergone we must do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may have been some slightly bad engineering, but the point one has to realise is that nuclear engineering has some of the highest forms of technology that the human <span class="highlight">race</span> has yet attained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>If by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin of that other person or of any relative or associate of that other person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></li>
