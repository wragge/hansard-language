    <p>If so, I ask: Having regard to the undeniable fact -that the vast majority of this country’s manufacturing work force is geared to, and is expected to obtain production schedules based upon achievement in’ high volume overseas companies, can it be assumed that the Minister’s remarks were directed to that section of high level executive personnel who spend so much of the working week on golf and <span class="highlight">race</span> courses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that the South African Government is well aware that the great majority of Australians would welcome sporting teams from South Africa selected on the basis of sporting prowess without regard to <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to a report by  Mr Wallace  Brown in the ‘Courier Mail’ of 25th June, it also decided to adopt as policy, free family planning clinics, free contraception, legal advertising of contraceptives, free child care centres and a public investigation to determine the best way to encourage small families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  believe and 1 am quite certain that there are older members on the other side who believe that the Government should recognise that it has run its <span class="highlight">race</span>, it has run its time and it ought to vacate office in the interests of the people of this country generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When was his Department’s attention drawn to the finding in the final report of  Australian Studies in School Performance- The Mastery of Literacy and Numeracy  (produced under the auspices ofthe Australian Council for Educational Research in April 1 977 pursuant to the suggestion made to it in February 1 975 by  Mr <span class="highlight">Race</span>  Mathews, M.P.,  Chairman  of the Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties) that, whereas slightly more than 1 per cent of pupils generally had a suspected or known hearing defect but did not wear a hearing aid, approximately 10 per cent of pupils at Aboriginal schools in the Northern Territory were considered by teachers to have such a handicap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the events described in part ( I ) encourage apartheid or separatism for the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is conscious of the difficulties that have, at times, emerged in the application of the existing criminal justice system to members of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> or the other problems that flow from decisions of the kind made by  Mr Justice  Gallop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to an old feud that has existed between New South Wales and Victoria relating to the disgraceful refusal by Victorians in 1863, to accept a Nowra <span class="highlight">race</span> horse, Archer, as an entrant in the Melbourne Cup. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that Nowra has enabled the honour of New South Wales to be satisfied and has softened this disgraceful performance by the Victorians which I believe led to a century of discontent and dismay and which certainly broke down any friendly relations that had existed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781109_reps_31_hor112/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Australian Broadcasting Commission make radio and television program changes during 1979 which included reductions in (a) <span class="highlight">race</span> broadcasts in Canberra, Melbourne, Newcastle and certain other centres and (b) speciality broadcasting especially on relay, such as  The World of Jazz  and  The Showman  formerly relayed from Sydney to Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-64-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as was reported in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ of 12th January 1970, the honourable gentleman said that there was a policy of ‘glaring <span class="highlight">race</span> discrimination in law in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea’ I say for my part that I know of no warrant for such a charge and that such a charge is utterly mischievous as well as being untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does  Mr Whitlam  deny that he said - and it was quoted in every Australian newspaper - that there were glaring <span class="highlight">race</span> discriminations in law in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They <span class="highlight">race</span> round the electorates of Australia criticising the Liberal Party, but look at them when they come into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always been concerned with the question of prejudice, whether that prejudice be based on class, religion or <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, at least today’s discrimination on the grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour is either formally disowned where it exists, or legally discouraged with varying degrees of conviction and success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>such other similar charitable purposes for the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> as the Minister from time to time approves.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a personal explanation later I challenged the Leader of the Opposition to deny that he had personally and publicly attacked the integrity of the New Guinea courts by alleging that there was a policy of ‘glaring <span class="highlight">race</span> discrimination in the law of the Territory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are motivated perhaps more than any other people to assert the manhood of the people of New Guinea in the face of a policy of glaring <span class="highlight">race</span> discrimination in law, economic opportunity and wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have tabled the Press release from the office of the Leader of the Opposition where, some days after these events, he referred to ‘glaring <span class="highlight">race</span> discrimination in law’ in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the Marxist-Lenist or Maoist way, which is to foment every grievance, to sharpen the class or <span class="highlight">race</span> struggle, to use terror as a political weapon and to use war as the ultimate sanction in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no time to listen to the blandishments of the Socialists who would use the present problems and frustrations of primary producers for political advantage and leave us a <span class="highlight">race</span> of peasants on collective farms if they had their way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a long while there has been a pseudo-liberal approach  to this by State governments, which have said: ‘We do not recognise <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in most areas, because we refuse to classify people according to <span class="highlight">race</span>, we do not have the special statistics we ought to have, and so we are dependent on private surveys in the Northern Territory such as that conducted by  Dr Lancaster-Jones,  which showed that in some areas of the Northern Territory the Aboriginal infant mortality rate was 200 per 1,000 compared with less than 20 per 1,000 for the European community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not kept separately according to races but those who have abstracted them, in what is, at any rate, a high degree of likelihood as to selection of <span class="highlight">race</span>, show that in those considered to be Aboriginals there is a very, very high mortality rate indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall read to the House figures we have achieved in the Northern Territory where there was some kind of dissection of the figures on the basis of Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be active, imaginative and positive, showing a genuine desire to help mankind live in peace, respecting human ideals and aspirations regardless of <span class="highlight">race</span>, creed or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was grossly unfair to a fine <span class="highlight">race</span> of people to set an arbitrary date for their independence, regardless of the wishes of those people, and to put impossible pressures on a people struggling to enter this age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that there was glaring <span class="highlight">race</span> discrimination in the law in the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people restrict this concern and emotional discomfort to the welfare of <span class="highlight">race</span> horses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This point was well emphasised recently when South Vietnamese cyclists conducted a bicycle <span class="highlight">race</span> throughout the length of South Vietnam and not one of them was harmed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its intention is being questioned by writers, producers, actors and designers - the forgotten <span class="highlight">race</span> of the Australian economic strata. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to the inviolability of the human <span class="highlight">race</span> and the fact that the main thing to be discussed in defence is the question of human existence, the survival of the human <span class="highlight">race</span> itself and the inner plans and plots of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shareholdings are not classified by <span class="highlight">race</span> but from inspection of records it appears that one public company has a small number of indigenous shareholders and’ the Development Bank holds 25,000 shares; one transport business owned by an indigene holds the licences for both the taxis in one centre; and the remaining twelve owners are nonindigenes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I might draw a phrase from the speech just delivered by the honourable member for Fremantle, I suppose it would be dream time to consider that this is an annual statement on the situation of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> at this point of time and/ or a philosophical study as to how we should look in future at their planned development, if that is the right phrase to use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was not on the list of speakers for this debate today, but when I heard some of the most extraordinary remarks which I thought I would ever hear in relation to the future development of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> I thought it only proper for somebody on this side of the House to rise in this debate, although perhaps with not enough thought or not enough homework. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unequal treatment to try to help them achieve some ultimate equality within this social spectrum is right, but I abhor the continuation of the Daisy Bates-ism that one hears from time to time in this House which advocates that they should remain as a separate <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I sought on the same platform at the Salisbury Teachers’ College in South Australia a resolution condemning naked aggression and hoping that the Government of the time would give some substantial help to enable this <span class="highlight">race</span> of people to remain an ethnic group with their own ethos and using their own capacities in the area in which they have lived for centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If certain people are denied the opportunity of joining the work force because of some reason associated with religion, politics, <span class="highlight">race</span>, sex, nationality or any other factor like that, productivity must suffer because fewer people than the number otherwise employed are working in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During this time the standard of personal living and affluence of the people of this nation raced ahead of that in most other nations and I could not but feel amazed that this Government, after so many years and so many election promises and after having set itself up as champion of the small man, the wage earner and the small business man, could introduce a Budget so devoid of any policy to deal with the crippling rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether even at this late stage he will not make it clear to the Premier of New South Wales,  Mr Lewis,  not with the equivocation which he has so far shown on the great issue before us all at the present time, that if the Premier does not retreat from the stand that he has taken on the filling of the current Senate vacancy he, the Leader of the Opposition, the man bound to uphold the traditions of parliamentary democracy in this country, will not appear with  Mr Lewis  on the platform at the public meeting which is to be held at Randwick <span class="highlight">race</span> course next Sunday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The BUI Will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based on <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, in the days when the honourable member for Moreton had a lot more money than he assured us he had when he was discussing the financial interests of parliamentarians, he had invested all his money on a horse at 4 to 1 and the bookmakers had expected that its price would drift to 5 to 1 or 6 to 1 so that they would cover themselves, but it started at odds on, the bookmakers controlling the AJC Committee could cancel all bets on that particular <span class="highlight">race</span> and start betting again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing whatsoever to profit mankind by taking the view that it is possible to assert a sense of superiority of one <span class="highlight">race</span> over another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever the differences may be, those differences are not to be quelled by resorting to the view that one <span class="highlight">race</span> is superior to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invariably it comes back to the fact that one <span class="highlight">race</span> has been intolerant of another and has sought to say: ‘They are inferior and as a consequence we will visit upon them the superiority of our might’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it is proposed that it is unlawful for a person to refuse another person access to any place on the grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is unlawful for a person, whether as principal or agent, to refuse or fail to dispose to another person an estate or interest in land by reason of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In language which I trust we all understand it is an offence to refuse to sell a house to a person because of his <span class="highlight">race</span>, his colour or his national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again all of us, I hope instinctively and certainly, educated by the melancholy experience of this century, would agree that that sort of thing is a very proper proposal for any society to embrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps someone will refuse to sell a house to a man because he is from another <span class="highlight">race</span>, from Greece or Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Having just listened to about half an hour of verbosity from the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who sits opposite, I state that I still have no possible explanation of why he is really opposed to this legislation except to conclude that what he really seeks is to perpetuate in this country the existing situation in which people can and do commit acts which discriminate against people of particular races and hide behind supposed rights at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to justice for committing these acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet in 1965-10 years agothe <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Act was passed in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To substantiate this criticism, I believe one needs only to look at the second reading speech of the then Secretary of State for the Home Department in the House of Commons when that gentleman introduced the British <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Bill in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore of not small importance to clearly establish that in broad terms the Bill is designed to protect individuals from situations of prejudice and disadvantage due to <span class="highlight">race</span> rather than to suggest that confrontation should be encouraged or that solutions to problems should be sought through rigid legal process rather than by conciliation and compromise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a claim that there are not thousands of cases in Australia where individuals have been deliberately prejudiced or discriminated against due to <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was complacently believed that the poor old black fellow would die out, that he was the last representative of a dying <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the new generation of young Aboriginal people come to write the history of their <span class="highlight">race</span> we will realise the extent of these atrocities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea of the <span class="highlight">race</span> dying away was replaced in the late 1940s and early 1950s by the idea that the Aboriginal people were disappearing in another way, that they were becoming just like us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the Bill seeks to ensure that racial discrimination should be proscribed by law and fundamental rights and freedoms, without distinction as to <span class="highlight">race</span>, should be guaranteed by law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While I applaud the need for a national spirit and national pride in one’s <span class="highlight">race</span> and country, I believe we should heed Lord Russell’s warning of national prejudice being commonly expressed and accepted as nationalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Government that there is room in the context of this debate for the view that the real path to tolerance between the races and between persons of different <span class="highlight">race</span> is not primarily to be found through legislative coercion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the right honourable member’s question: (1), (2) and (3) The Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968 provided for the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises to extend financial assistance to enable persons of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> of Australia to engage in business enterprises that had prospects of becoming or continuing to be successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A reference in this Part to the doing of an act by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin of a person includes a reference to the doing of an act for two or more reasons that include the first mentioned reason, whether or not that reason is the dominant reason for the doing of the act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to terminate any estate or interest in land of a second person or the right of a second person .to occupy any land or any residential or business accommodation, by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin of that second person or of any relative or associate of that second person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After sub-clause (2), insert the following sub-clause: ‘(2a) It is unlawful for a trade union or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of a trade union to prevent another person from offering for employment or from continuing in employment by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, or national or ethnic origin of that other person or of any relative or associate of that other person. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that there is merit in including in clause 15 a proviso making it unlawful for a trade union, or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of a trade union, to prevent another person offering for employment or continuing in employment by reason of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to comment that clause 14 prohibits the rules or other documents constituting or governing the activities of a trade union imposing any kind of hindrance regarding the joining of that union by reason of <span class="highlight">race</span> or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We therefore think that the Bill does not complete this process in a logical sequence by making it unlawful for the right of a person to offer and gain employment to be interfered with by a trade union on account of <span class="highlight">race</span> or ethnic or national origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a commitment of all the major political parties of this country to make unlawful any incidence of discrimination in employment whether it be on the grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>, sex, colour or political or other opinions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the clause provides that it is unlawful for an employer or someone acting for him to refuse or fail to employ a person by reason of <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that person is a German, an Italian or of some other <span class="highlight">race</span> he could say: ‘This man has sacked me because I am not a dinky-di Aussie’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A reference in this Fart to the doing of an act by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origin of a person includes a reference to the doing of an act for two or more reasons that include the first-mentioned reason, whether or not that reason is the dominant reason for the doing of the act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 8 deals with those situations where there are two or more reasons for a person doing an act, one of which is by reason of the <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour, or national or ethnic origin of another person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I admit that the question of <span class="highlight">race</span> discrimination is something in the hearts and minds of people, and it will not be resolved by law, the fact is that in this country the law is not only an expression as outlined in legislation but also it has to have the look of force or the effect of governmental power behind it before most people will take it seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that those who would speak against the argument I am putting would inevitably point their finger at Nazi Germany, would inevitably draw attention to the dissemination of ideas in books and periodicals which seek to assert that one <span class="highlight">race</span> is inherently superior to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again there would be no difference between the Government and, I think, the Oppositioncertainly myself- in relation to the intention, but I am worried as to the interpretation that might be placed on this proviso in a court of law if it had to take it into account in relation to an appeal under clause 10 of the Bill by a person of a non-Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> who was claiming the special rights that are given to the people of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> under legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to point out to the House that there are people on islands in the Torres Strait who are not members of the <span class="highlight">race</span> to which Torres Strait Islanders belong and to whom the Queensland legislation, that is the Torres Strait Islands Act of 1971, applies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is designed to ensure that any property in Queensland of an Aboriginal or Islander shall not be managed by any other person without the consent of the Aboriginal or Islander concerned except insofar as the general law in Queensland for the management of property applies without regard to <span class="highlight">race</span>, colour or national or ethnic origins of persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He brought with him the concept- I ask honourable members to bear in mind that this was 15 years ago- that the South Australian Government was ruining the initiative and the individuality of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> by making it too easy for Aborigines to claim, for example, free tucker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that this state of affairs was destroying the dignity and the individuality of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> in those areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us accept that there is discrimination and that much of the discrimination directed against the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> is most unfortunate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to develop that pride and that individuality in the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that it is an attitude that will be adopted by other members of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Aborigines will take more pride in their <span class="highlight">race</span> and that they will be encouraged by governments to hold up their heads and do their job of work to the benefit of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So we are here tonight to remove the discriminatory provisions that remain in the Queensland legislation, and to make provisions with respect to the people of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> of Australia and the <span class="highlight">race</span> to which the Torres Strait Islanders belong for the purpose of preventing discrimination in certain respects against those peoples under the laws of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He raised a question about the definition of ‘Islander’, and he reminded us that in the Torres Strait islands there are a number of people who are not of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> and not of the Torres Strait Islanders <span class="highlight">race</span> but people who had come from other Pacific islands ethnically quite different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of ‘Islander’ states: ‘Islander’ means a person who is a member of the <span class="highlight">race</span> to which Torres Strait Islanders belong; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that this definition would automatically exclude from the operation of the Bill people who are living, and who perhaps for some generations have been living, on Torres Strait islands but who are not of the Torres Strait Islanders <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that ‘Islander’ means a person who is a member of the <span class="highlight">race</span> to which Torres Strait Islanders belong or is a Pacific Islander settled for at least one generation in the Torres Strait islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my opinion and in the opinion of the Government, no group of people has the right to say to any other people of the same <span class="highlight">race</span>: ‘You shall not enter upon this reserve’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750409_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it is because of our inability to understand the magnitude of the tragedy that this authority has been established as an advisory authority only- not as an enforcing authority that would make people who have been neglecting their obligation to the human <span class="highlight">race</span> act in a more responsible manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That $46 lm is being paid by the Australian taxpayer to people for doing nothing, paid for one of two reasons: Either there is no work for them or there is work but the scandalous way the Labor Party has softened the work test has allowed to flourish in this country a <span class="highlight">race</span> of bludgers who are doing nothing, want to do nothing and yet are being paid for it by the Australian taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as this country is concerned, with a person going abroad and entering into what appears to be a polygamous union no great difficulty arises, but I venture to suggest that where a person comes from abroad where polygamous unions are permitted very grave problems can arise, particularly having regard to the fact that in recent years Australia has embarked upon what one may describe- I trust not offensivelyas a pluralistic society in terms of <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia should plan to avoid any conflicts or frictions arising from racial or national differences and while doing so should be liberal in admission to Australia of people of any <span class="highlight">race</span> or nationality who desire to come, especially those who are suffering from reprisals or discrimination in some other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, the growing body of Federal law in new areas, such as consumer protection, administrative law, the regulation of the securities and exchange industry and perhaps even the area of <span class="highlight">race</span> relations would, if administered by State courts, place an added burden on courts where there are already delays due to the volume of litigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board of the United Kingdom has such a power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sole purpose of the provision is to prevent the conciliation processes of the Bill, which the Opposition supports, from being frustrated by non- cooperation of persons alleged to have discriminated on grounds of <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effectiveness of the <span class="highlight">Race</span> Relations Board of the United Kingdom is widely recognised as being impeded by the absence of these powers and their absence in the United Kingdom permits the Board’s attempts at conciliation to be virtually ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation in its amended form, which we welcome and which we support, now conforms to the Opposition’s view that the best way to promote harmony between the races in Australia is through the process of conciliation, education and- one hopes, in the long term- greater understanding between the races without the existence of legislative coercion of the type originally proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this legislation an Aboriginal means a person who is a member of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> of Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is a man who is half Aboriginal a member of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> or is he a member of the European or some other <span class="highlight">race</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My inclination is to use the widest possible terminology and to give some direction to the administrative system that that is the way the definition is to be applied- to say that an Aboriginal is a member of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> of Australia if he is accepted by the Aboriginal people and considers himself to be one of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last thing we would want would be <span class="highlight">race</span> catalogues in which people would have to define their ancestry in such a way that they were able to say whether they were or were not Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may even be a kind of pattern which we- the superior <span class="highlight">race</span>, or so we like to consider ourselves- should be imposing on other people, the lesser breeds without the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we should certainly define an Aboriginal as a person who is predominantly a member of the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> and perhaps as a person who has been accepted in the community with which he is associated by reason of his conforming to its customs whatever they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751105_reps_29_hor97/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The disposal of waste from the use of uranium is an issue which goes to the fundamental survival of the human <span class="highlight">race</span>, but the Prime Minister is prepared to deliberately misrepresent the facts on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">race</span> to abdication, the haste with which this Government is abandoning responsibility, can be seen by contrasting the 1977 Budget with the Hayden Budget of two years earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the capitalist and the Marxist see human happiness depending upon economic growth but our experience with economic growth- the pursuit of it, the rat <span class="highlight">race</span> that it involves, the acquisitive alienated society which it produces- should have demonstrated that that is a myth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless he gives much more money, let me make it clear that that proposal will have the effect of increasing the queue for building funds; the more affluent people will joint the rat <span class="highlight">race</span> with the less affluent, and the most needy people will probably be the ones who will be unable to demonstrate a capacity to repay, even though they would be just as suitable as tenants as some other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>discrimination or unequal status based on <span class="highlight">race</span> cannot be eliminated, and may not even be affected, by preventing the collecting of data which will reveal its extent, in all probability this will merely allow inequalities to continue unchecked, especially since those responsible can then deny the inequalities exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-23-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The stations broadcast the prices less than 10 minutes before the start of a <span class="highlight">race</span> whereas betting on the TAB in New South Wales closes 10 minutes before the start and you have no chance of getting a bet on with the TAB after that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I consider it a good thing that the relatively small membership of the Commonwealth, with its heavy representation of Third World countries, exposes the Government to more searching scrutiny of its policies, especially on questions involving <span class="highlight">race</span>, than would be the case if our international appearances were confined to the larger, more anonymous forums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find the rejection of Apex as an organisation worthy of recognition at a time when Australia Post has just completed a series of stamps in recognition of Australia’s great <span class="highlight">race</span> horses, and I am interested in racing, to be very inconsistent and difficult to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, socialism works in devious ways and we have to show it for what it really is- a righteous rationalisation of totalitarian tyranny, in the name of the collective well-being of the proletariat, <span class="highlight">race</span> or fatherland and in the name of public interest, brotherhood and equality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>4225  (Hansard,  7 June 1 979, page 3168) what was the nature of the refitting carried out by the Navy on  Anaconda II  so that she could meet the special regulations and safety specifications for the Fastnet <span class="highlight">race</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This House of some 120-odd people, some of them very odd, proposes to wait for three-quarters of an hour or thereabouts while people watch a team of horses flogged around a <span class="highlight">race</span> track in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose that there is something symbolic about this Parliament waiting for a horse <span class="highlight">race</span> to finish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will be galloping round a circular <span class="highlight">race</span> track, going like the devil, being flogged and cheered down the last straight, madly competitive, running around in circles and getting nowhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the technical achievement of televising the <span class="highlight">race</span> is - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The horses will not be getting anywhere; the <span class="highlight">race</span> is competitive, it is speculative, it is non-productive and there could be no better comparison made than between it and this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is true to say that historically the Australian people, because of their attitude, have tended to regard the Aboriginal <span class="highlight">race</span> as one which has not produced anything of cultural significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that one of the problems of the philosophy of this Government has been that because it takes an essentially competitive view of the market and the way in which politics works, it takes the view that life is really divided into winners and losers and that the <span class="highlight">race</span> is always to the swift and the battle to the strong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
