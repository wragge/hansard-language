    <p>Does the Government intend to increase its aid contributions to Fiji having regard lo the likely granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to Fiji later this year; if so, to what extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-38-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will he make an early statement on precautions to be taken to prevent, or at least to assess, the costs and benefits of the Jervis Bay reactor plans as compared with alternative power projects including (a) the risks of a major plant accident (however unlikely) and radioactive ore transport leakage pollution, (b) radioactive waste disposal techniques and their long-term effectiveness, (c) environmental ecology, (d) the cost factor of safety provisions and (e) the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Atomic Energy Authority from profitability motives or influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that presidential members of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are appointed for life and Conciliation Commissioners are appointed until they attain the age of 65 years, will he give consideration to amending the Public Service Act in such a way as to give to all members of the Public Service Board the same tenure of office and opportunity for <span class="highlight">independence</span> as is already enjoyed by Conciliation Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 14th March 1939, the Slovak Diet unanimously adopted a declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by which Slovakia denied its allegiance to the Central Government of the Czechoslovak Republic in Prague and declared itself a sovereign state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-50-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the (a) date and (b) validity of Croatian <span class="highlight">independence</span> which various organisations in Australia celebrate in April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-35-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has Australia ever recognised the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Croatia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-35-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has Australia ever recognised the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Slovakia (Hansard, 7th April 1971, page 1650). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-35-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has picked up the point of the Australian Labor Party’s policy of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are consistent and not inconsistent as the Minister suggests, because if you believe in the early <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea you also believe in the early selection of members of the Administrator’s Executive Council as a step on the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, believing in early <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea, we do not want the Minister for External Territories to be choosing the inner ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are consistent in believing in early <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and also in believing in early responsibility, that the 17 Ministers should choose their inner cabinet rather than the Administrator and the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will have <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1975 and the decision will be made  in  Canberra, not in Port Moresby.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the duty of the Government - of any government - to ignore such people and to provide the defence forces necessary for the freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was it in accordance with Government policy for the then Minister for Immigration in April 1970 to attend a meeting celebrating the anniversary of Croatian <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it still the view of his Government (a) that the Croatian <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebrated in April is the creation of a puppet Croatian state by the Germans on 10 April 1941, dominated by the Ustasha terrorist movement under Ante Pavelic and (b) that Australia does not recognise the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Croatia (Hansard, 28th April 1971, page 2211). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am advised that the then Minister for Immigration did not attend, in April 1970, a meeting celebrating the Anniversary of Croation <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, nor has he ever done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-33-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3307 (Hansard, 18th August 1971), led to believe that their efforts to preserve their <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be supported if necessary by allied forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only last month, I notice, the publication ‘The Australian Liberal’ was referring to such matters as my Party has been advocating and which the Minister enunciates as ‘hasty and arbitrary <span class="highlight">independence</span> for New Guinea’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will he also ensure that in appointing the third person, which is at his discretion under the provisions of the Electoral Act, he will choose a senior Commonwealth public servant, as was formerly done, in order clearly to establish complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> from political parties of all the commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-46-18">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also the concern of the United Nations which by General Assembly Resolution 2977 of 14th December 1972 called upon Austrafia to prepare, in consultation with the government of Papua New Guinea, a timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-40-10">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the debate is resumed on the Papua New Guinea Bill I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Bill, the Papua New Guinea Loans Guarantee Bill, the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Bill and the Social Services <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  verv accurately pointed out yesterday that the people of New Guinea, including its political leaders, are suffering verv grievously by confusion deliberately spread bv expatriates, including officials, as to the real meaning of terms like self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The member for Fremantle, the member for Oxley and I found throughout the Territory that one of our greatest difficulties was to reassure the people, even members of the House of Assembly, that neither selfgovernment nor <span class="highlight">independence</span> meant the end of Australian aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The greatest single step towards the political education of New Guineans this Parliament itself could advance would be to make a formal declaration that Australian aid and Australian assistance will continue after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are words of fire in it and about it, but so far as we are concerned our <span class="highlight">independence</span> was won at Yorktown by General Washington and in the House of Commons by Edmund Burke, because although his words were ignored at the time they were not forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Throughout the journey the Leader of the Opposition and those who were with him tried to point out that the United Nations Organisation, that very year, had insisted by a vote of 112 to none that Australia should forthwith hand over Papua and New Guinea to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the first time there was no demand for a time table, and for the first time that this happens the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister, goes into the arena, and takes on Russia’s job for her and demands a time table for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the critical situation of the rural economy both requires and justifies urgent and substantial Government financial assistance, and in applying this assistance the Government must aim for longterm strength, stability and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the rural community rather than attempt to deal with the present conditions by measures prompted by the desire for political popularity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel certain that the Australian people will continue to be happy to provide grants in aid to Papua and New Guinea for many years to come on a scale comparable to our present efforts, but I do believe that it is in the interests of the people of Papua and New Guinea and the people of Australia that the moves towards, firstly, internal selfgovernment and, later, political <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be accelerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It went on to protest against the Agreement that had been made because it said it was contrary to the long term interests and the wishes of the people of South Vietnam who had a right to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and freedom and did not want aggression within their own territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a violation of Czechoslovakian <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and the subsequent effects were that the liberal regime - the Dubcek Smrkovsky regime - was in fact replaced, Dubcek was sent out of the country, all liberal reform ceased and NeoStalinism was once again resumed in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now that an announcement has been made regarding the date for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Fiji  1  am sure that the Government and the people of Australia extend best wishes to the new nation which will emerge after that date and express the hope that there will be a continuation of the very happy relationshi p that has existed in so many fields, particularly in the field of aviation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition must know that we in Australia will do whatever we can to assist Fiji in its bid for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and I have gone out of my way to try to help the local sugar industry there achieve its goal of ensuring that South Pacific Sugar Mills will in fact mill sugar products over the course of the next few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Indonesian Government has denied it and to the best of my knowledge no arms and equipment are being provided from this country and you,  Sir, would  not expect it to be as it is a neutral country and now has taken the initiative to call a conference to try to ensure the neutrality and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the first part of the honourable gentleman’s question, the Lon Nol Government did not ask for the assistance that was given by South Vietnam and the United States of America but yesterday the Premier himself,  Mr Lon  Nol, issued a statement in which he said that the liberation government of Cambodia recognised that the action by the United States and South Vietnam was taken in order to achieve the freedom, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the realisation of the highest ideals of the people and the Government of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Vietnam Moratorium Campaign is, 1 believe, a further attempt to brainwash the ordinary decent people of this country against the desire of the Government and the decent people of Australia to protect the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a sovereign state in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Vietnam Moratorium efforts have been directed to weakening the morale of our people and the morale of those people who are setting out to try to preserve the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a non-Communist state in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect he is saying that Australia has been so remiss and ineffectual in fulfilling its clear obligations to prepare and educate the people of New Guinea for political <span class="highlight">independence</span> that even the basic concept of Government and Opposition in a parliamentary democracy is not understood there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uncertainty we found was not about the question of the readiness of New Guinea for self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, not about the timetable that might be applied by this Government or by a Labor government, but about the role in terms of money and men that Australia would be willing to provide for a self-governing New Guinea and subsequently an independent New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is astonishing and disturbing how widespread is the impression that <span class="highlight">independence</span>, self’government even, will mean an end to Australian help in money and men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever opinions may exist about the timing of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, it has to be realised that any prolongation of our colonial rule is inherently artificial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The onus of proof is not on New Guinea to show that it is ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second basic proposition is  that the obligation we assumed to bring New Guinea to <span class="highlight">independence</span> is one which we sought ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia would not have been permitted to remain in New Guinea as trustee had she not promised to prepare New Guinea for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this is the crucial question, it is quite misleading for the Minister for External Territories to assert that the matters of self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for New Guinea are matters for New Guineans alone to decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Superficially the Minister’s reiterated statement that ‘<span class="highlight">independence</span> is a matter for New Guineans alone to decide’ looks like a simple and straight-forward statement of the principle of self determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate of advance towards political <span class="highlight">independence</span> is determined by that authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decisions to establish the old Legislative Council, to enlarge it, to replace it with the House of Assembly, to draw up a common roll, to set up open and regional electorates, to create ministerial members, to establish local government councils - that is, all the decisions which the Government would claim as being designed to prepare New Guinea, for <span class="highlight">independence</span> - were decisions of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The refusal to lay down any framework at all for the timing of self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> is itself a recipe for uncertainty and confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Fremantle has frequently pointed out, the Government uses confusion and frequently promotes confusion about the practical meaning of self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to delay self government and defer <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental divergence of opinion between the Government and the Opposition is at this point: The Government believes that the longer <span class="highlight">independence</span> is deferred the better the prospects for good relations will be; we believe that the longer it is deferred the worse the prospects will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next stage was the more formal invasion of South Vietnam by North Vietnamese forces, by North Vietnamese formations penetrating right into this country which was seeking to preserve ‘ its own <span class="highlight">independence</span>, just adding to and accelerating the butchery, the terror, the dreadful impositions upon the peasantry in the villages and the poor people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the mounting pressure on both these fronts and particularly on the fighting front in South Vietnam; the increasing terror and the reckless, relentless attacks with mortars, the ruthless murder of village headmen, the systematic murdering of schoolteachers and any people who could give a lead, and the introduction of larger military formations from the North led to the position where the South Vietnam Government, still seeking to protect the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of its people, asked the United States to send military aid and asked Australia and other countries to send military aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Vietnamese who want their own <span class="highlight">independence</span> have indicated that even without support they would fight as long as they could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given time I believe the tactics and purposes of fighting for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the right of the Vietnamese to determine their own future will succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When is the Labor Party prepared to make a stand and say that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a small country, which has few people as Australia has few people, is something that is important to us just as our own <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be important to us? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or does the Australian Labor Party say that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a small nation is precious only if that country is governed by a Communist Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second attitude which could be an explanation of Labor’s policy is that it does not matter, that it is too far away, that it is not our concern and that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a small country just does not matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it concerns our own <span class="highlight">independence</span>, or does it not matter even then? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had representations from many people in the Territory asking that the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  go to the Territory and reassure the people that they will not be pushed into self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> by 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s present policy of pushing the Territory into self-government by 1972 if, of course, it gets into power - a big ‘if - and <span class="highlight">independence</span> by 1976 represents a drastic change from the policy pursued by the right honourable member for Melbourne Our policy is 1 of political change sanctioned by the people of Papua and New Guinea through their elected House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We agree with the Australian Government’s policy that the timing of <span class="highlight">independence</span> is a matter for the people of the Territory to decide for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The move for <span class="highlight">independence</span> is being made by the Pangu Party, which has 10 members in the Assembly and claims to be a national party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Its members who speak of <span class="highlight">independence</span> have no experience of PapuaNew Guinea and have never ever worked with the people of Papua-New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went up there in 1964 and he said: ‘<span class="highlight">Independence</span> by 1970’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party supports this policy of self-government by 1972 and <span class="highlight">independence</span> by 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to our own purpose, we have made it clear on a number of occasions that what we want is freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the right of these countries to determine their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most important item on the agenda is the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and neutralisation of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the long and sometimes torrid period of colonialisation by the French, starting in 1847, cannot be identified as the beginning of the struggle for <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Indo-China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ballot box was to be the new arsenal for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and its use was not conditional on any domino theory or subject to the consideration that one side or the other would win at the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700508_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to direct attention to the fact that although great fluctuations have occurred in the political, economic - and, for that matter - the sociological aspects of Indonesia and its development since <span class="highlight">independence</span>, there has been truly a continuing interest by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the figures at least cause us to ask: ‘Are we doing enough in trade with the great nation that is on our doorstep and to which we helped to bring <span class="highlight">independence</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I ask for them is enough to live out their lives with dignity; enough to ensure that they can afford 3 meals a day; enough to know that they can meet their rent or rates without depriving themselves of food or clothes to do so; and enough so that they can maintain their self respect and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members who were in the House at that time - I was not one of them but I remember the debate - will recollect that it was the Government’s argument that it wanted to give the Laboratories <span class="highlight">independence</span> and put them on this viable commercial footing so that its existence would be self justifying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, he must have a reputation for <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought and action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later on I hope to deal with protective devices that assure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this Corporation and protect the Australian people from just what the honourable member for Chifley was talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only hope that these great nations, representing - as they do  -  250 million people of the Asian region will be able to bring their influence to bear on other countries, particularly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in an attempt to make some contribution towards the defence of freedom and of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an Australian company expansion too often means a loss of <span class="highlight">independence</span>; a loss of Australian control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the communique issued at the 1966 Prime Ministers’ Conference in London included the following: ‘The British Government stands ready to give <span class="highlight">independence</span> to territories that want it and can sustain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the right honourable gentleman given further consideration to my question a fortnight ago on Australian representation at the South Pacific Conference next September in Fiji on the eve of that country’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister at the time,  Sir Robert  Menzies, had said in Australia that <span class="highlight">independence</span> must come sooner or later and he favoured it sooner rather than later; a bombshell through Papua-New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 want to say one thing quite clearly: We do not agree with the Government that it is real to say to the people of Papua and New Guinea that <span class="highlight">independence</span> will come when they ask for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly favour continuing a treaty for 15  years after <span class="highlight">independence</span>: to continue providing economic, financial and technical ass stance to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Labor Party is concerned, it is not a matter of the only factor being what the House of Assembly decides and if somebody can organise the highlands bloc efficiently never to ask for it, <span class="highlight">independence</span> never comes or does not come for 50 or 60 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is nol the only factor in <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then in 1976, after 4 years of discussion, assuming the Labor Party had power to decide these things, you would commence your discussion about <span class="highlight">independence</span>, lt is not a matter of pushing them off the cliff but at that time the discussions on the subject of <span class="highlight">independence</span> might take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at some stage - we believe in 1976 - they have to start giving their minds to the question of full <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is significant is nol that the United Nations as an assembly passes resolutions which are overwhelmingly in favour of <span class="highlight">independence</span>: What is significant is that something like 100 governments of the world, having sat down and considered Papua and New Guinea, have instructed their delegates to urge the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once an independent school, particularly of the type I have mentioned, the wealthy schools, begins to calculate its finances on that sort of basis, that is the thin edge of the wedge that is being driven into the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the first sapping of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of those schools; it could lead to a very substantial lessening of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of such schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As usual he deliberately sets out to confuse a certain minority of New Guineans by ignoring the distinction between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major problem which the Government faces in its present administration of the Territory lies in the pressures which are being exerted for the definition of dates for home rule and for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In principle, I think that the Government’s announced policy is a very correct one - that is, that it is the people themselves who must decide when they want home rule and when they want <span class="highlight">independence</span> rather than having these things imposed upon them by the administering authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to emphasise that there can be no true and full <span class="highlight">independence</span>, whatever the political situation, without economic <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that in the public debate on <span class="highlight">independence</span> fundamental economic facts will not be ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To sum up, I would say that Australia’s position has to be that the people in Papua and New Guinea can have home rule and <span class="highlight">independence</span> whenever they decide that they want it, secure in the knowledge that Australian assistance, in terms of money, advice and technical and administrative know-how - and we have built up expertise and experience in this less developed country - will continue for as long as the people want it and circumstances remain reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In developing the Territory of Papua and New Guinea towards eventual <span class="highlight">independence</span> we must always keep in mind the hope that when <span class="highlight">independence</span> finally does come Australia will have gained a friend and ally, one with whom we can continue close cooperation in our mutual interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of this Government has been that <span class="highlight">independence</span> should neither be hastened nor delayed, but rather that it should reflect the capacity and the desire of the community to accept greater responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was also at Daru where he was reported to have said for the first time that New Guinea under a Labor government would have internal self-government in 1972 and complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1976, irrespective of whether the people of New Guinea wanted it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Highlands he met the same type of political thinking that has nonplussed United Nations visiting missions - the fear of the coastal people developing too quickly and dominating the Highlanders, allied wim the suspicion chai once <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes the Australians will go home taking their money with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then he goes on to say that he will force us to accept complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> by 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to make  it  clear that Australia’s main objective should  be  to bring about <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Territory as early as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 would hope that, as it develops towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> - and I believe that the parliamentary system is the way in which it will develop its <span class="highlight">independence</span> - we will recognise that every time it makes a law which is not vetoed at a higher level, this is an exercise of selfgovernment, and that is the way it ought to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the national view might well be one which, at least from the point of view of this Government - and without necessarily endangering the <span class="highlight">independence</span> or autonomy of the States - would at least subject them to a comparatively critical analysis in terms of what the States put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a short Bill, the principal effect of which will be to permit the States to enact legislation requiring  the  licensing  of  premises used for processing fish for either domestic consumption or export.It also omits Nauru from the scope  of  the Fisheries Act following the granting  of  <span class="highlight">independence</span>  to  that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of these recent events and the widespread public disquiet which followed attempts to muzzle current affairs programmes, I believe that a declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the ABC should be incorporated in the Broadcasting and Television Act as the main cornerstone of the controlling legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real fact of the situation is that the Government, having done nothing constructive in the area for so long, allows the Commission to develop its principles with the best will in the world and with the utmost skill it can muster - as common law courts have developed principles and law over the years in developing systems of common law - but the Government does not accord the Commission the <span class="highlight">independence</span> it is entitled to and which it gives to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there seemed to be a general movement toward a common ideal - a general upgrading of the colleges of advanced education - that their purposes should be more technical and more professional and that there should be a movement of the universities perhaps in the same direction, coupled of course, with a desire on the part of colleges of advanced education to attain to the ideals of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, free inquiry and research that are so often associated with universities but which traditionally have not been found in technical colleges, at least not to the same extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We live in changing times, and today even in our high schools, let alone in the colleges of advanced education, one gets a planting of these ideals of inquiry, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and thinking things out for oneself which at one time we tended to associate almost exclusively with the university ideal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the high incidence of Army coups among newly independent nations, I ask: To what extent is the Australian Army increasing the number of indigenous commissioned officers in the Pacific Islands Regiment and what steps, if any, are being taken to ensure that the Regiment does not develop into an elite organisation which is capable of staging a coup when Papua and New Guinea gain <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an extraordinary statement from a member of the Australian Labor Party which has advocated self-government, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and goodness knows what else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These reports show quite clearly that, if there was any liar or scoundrel insofar as the negotiations were concerned, it was Smith, who had gone so far as to advise the then Prime Minister of Australia,  Sir Robert  Menzies, that he had not and could not meet the British Prime Minister over the matter of Rhodesia and <span class="highlight">independence</span> when he had in fact done so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It became apparent too that any new arrangements would need to be considered against the background of a quicker movement towards internal selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once people begin to think about <span class="highlight">independence</span> it is not long before they demand it and then have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This had the very salutary effect of ending the sense of infinite leisure with which, in a world of very intense pressures, the whole approach was being made to the development of self-government and ultimately <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if Papua New Guinea goes into <span class="highlight">independence</span> with the situation in the Gazelle as it is now, it will be a tragedy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they want to delay the processes of selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> - if they understand what is being talked about in self-government - that ought to count as important with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in the intial stages of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, I think that Papua New Guinea needs a strong central figure to be a focal point of loyalty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We note that the Ministerial Members believe that <span class="highlight">independence</span> may be accelerated and that the whole planning ought to be on the basis of accelerated <span class="highlight">independence</span> - the faster it is done the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent of the distress which Labor policy has created is measured by a motion which passed through the House of Assembly by  36  votes to  11  and which stated that, if Labor won the next election in Australia and attempted to impose selfgovernment on Papua New Guinea without the consent of a majority of the people, the next House of Assembly should petition the United Nations to direct the Australian Government to act in accordance with the freely expressed will and desire of the people of Papua New Guinea, as guaranteed by the United Nations declaration on the granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to colonial countries and peoples, and by the policy of the present Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is any more than an evolution of the parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition has consistently told the people of Papua New Guinea: ‘You will have <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1972 or early 1973 should Labor come into power at the next Federal election in Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the Opposition has taken no notice of the majority view expressed in Papua New Guinea, except for tonight, that <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will have <span class="highlight">independence</span> whether you want it or not, whether you are prepared for it or not, when we tell you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand the Government has consistently held the attitude that <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be a matter of agreement between the people of Papua New Guinea and the Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has held the view that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would not be forced on the people against their will or withheld against their will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not only a wholly responsible attitude but one which recognises the right of the indigenous people to have the major say in the decision when <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be promulgated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again I would like to stress my belief in the importance of experienced expatriate officers whom I see as providing an enormous stabilising force in the first difficult years of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we have the principle of absolute equality of citizens before the law - with everyone, no matter what his station, subject to the law - whilst we have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary and whilst we have the right of freedom of speech and assembly so long as the freedoms of other people are not infringed, the rights of individual citizens are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this statement outlines another stage in the remarkable progress towards selfgovernment and eventual <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ray  Whitrod, the former Commissioner of Police in Papua New Guinea, with all the benefits of police intelligence, warns that <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self-government for Papua New Guinea should not be delayed because of the worsening race relations there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I agree with the United Nations Mission, or some members of it, that there is far too much brain washing by expatriate interests suggesting that if Papua New Guinea is to have <span class="highlight">independence</span> it has to have a lot of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition made perfectly clear that with the coming of selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> he was prepared to continue the financial grants; he was prepared to continue the expatriate officers in a Department of Pacific Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, will he, in view of the rapidly increasing tensions and rising pressures for self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Papua New Guinea, make an immediate and favourable decision on the request and so enable members of this Parliament to be better informed on the aspirations of the people of Papua New Guinea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many a child whose future looked bleak has been given new <span class="highlight">independence</span> and a new outlook on life because of the training he has received in a sheltered workshop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that for once in a way we will see that Liberal <span class="highlight">independence</span> whereby honourable members opposite can vote as they like - cross the floor and say anything - and nothing will happen to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the most important things is to preserve its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a credit to all concerned - to the people who manage the ABC and to Parliament - that in general the ABC in both radio and television seems to preserve a fair amount of impartiality or <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I took the view then, as I do today, that if selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> were to mean anything at all to the people of Papua New Guinea they must not be too dependent economically on Australia and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there was a rationale for another independent inquiry, surely the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that inquiry might best be achieved by appointing reviewers from outside the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australians should never forget that this Government, which said that our security and future <span class="highlight">independence</span> was challenged by the menace from the north - and Vietnam was cited as an example - saw fit to call up only a section of the 20-year olds of this country and place on them the full responsibility for the defence of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council for Aboriginal Affairs has indicated that for this goal to be achieved increasing emphasis must be given to measures to promote the greater economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Aboriginal Australians as individuals and as groups - especially in the north and centre as communities - and to strengthen their capacity to manage their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710930_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would increase the degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Australian delegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since that time the concept that Australians should control the destiny and the natural resources of their own nation - I will not say that it has caught fire because I believe that in the hearts of most of our countrymen there has been a feeling that we should retain some semblance of <span class="highlight">independence</span> - has created a tremendous response across the nation, indicating the desire of ordinary Australians and their children to have a continuing stake in their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it does seem to me, in listening to a succession of speakers, that they do the cause of Papua New Guinea’s self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> some disservice in their highly selective criticism of what is in fact happening there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While this has been true only to a limited extent, it is something which a country preparing for unity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> cannot afford to tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently when I attended the international conference on Bangla Desh in Delhi and subsequently visited the refugee camps around Calcutta I found people from many parts of the world who were intent on establishing an international force to help the people of East Pakistan regain <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you walk through the refugee camps you see thousands of people calling out the war cries of Bangla Desh, with their fists raised, calling for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and sovereignty and for the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who, as honourable members know, has been detained without trial in Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The political party which advocated <span class="highlight">independence</span> for East Pakistan and which the refugees supported swept the polls at recent elections, capturing 167 seats out of 169. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because, in the main, of the maltreatment of the people by the military regime which controls East Pakistan and which will not give them their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, almost 10 million refugees have fled from East Pakistan to India and the Indian Government has been burdened with a cost of almost $A3m a day to house, feed and provide for these unfortunate people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one looks at the changes in the status of territories which have occurred since the Second World War, one sees a history of accelerating progression towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> throughout the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make quite clearly is this: It is of no earthly use saying that we should send government armaments to help a country retain its <span class="highlight">independence</span> against some form of aggression if we are not allowed to give those armaments to the troops of that country itself because, obviously there are no othertroops that can be referred to in this context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the calls that are coming from the other side are for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of East Pakistan from its present militaristic rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not arguing that one way or the other but is it right that members of the Opposition should be arguing for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of East Pakistan when they could not care  a  hoot in hell about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Cambodia and South Vietnam and when they seemingly have no concern for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Taiwan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition talks of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in foreign affairs and defence matters, but the Government has been practising it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is this <span class="highlight">independence</span> and is this a uniquely Australian foreign policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Leader of the Opposition to talk in terms of Communist Chinese solutions to problems when we are talking in terms of our own solutions to these problems? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other matter I would like to mention is the question of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Australian foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, particularly following the High Court decision invalidating State receipts duties as they applied to certain types of transaction, it was clear that, notwithstanding these large increases in Commonwealth revenue assistance, it would be desirable for the States to have access to a new source of taxation to give them greater freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in revenue raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore the maintenance of Indonesia’s strength and <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be a high priority of our economic aid, and our foreign and defence policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although this is proper in terms of status and prestige and from the point of view of its relationship to the Universities Commission, honour able members need to have it explained to them, as the honourable member for Denison  (Dr Solomon)  has pointed out, that the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education has for a large number of years operated with a good deal of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and in precisely the same manner as it would have operated if it had had the independent statutory powers of a commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last point I would like to make is that the Group of Five as they call themselves, who want to expand into a Group of Ten, of which Indonesia is one of the leading members, desires to have the Pacific theatre or the zone in which they live declared a zone of peace, neutrality and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian judges have been invited to accept situations in Cyprus, Tonga and Nauru and, when Papua New Guinea achieves <span class="highlight">independence</span>, they will undoubtedly be asked in many cases and for some years to accept appointments there, too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may well be that, come <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and before <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the Government ought to make a special earmarked grants to bring the Highlands into the general flow of development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While this has been true only to a limited extent, it is something which a country preparing for unity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> cannot afford to tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among other things  Sir Robert  Menzies said the Government had the firmest intention of preserving the full <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Tariff Board but he stressed that the Board was an advisory body and that tariff policy as such was the responsibility of the Government, that only Parliament can enact tariffs and that only the Government proposes tariff legislation to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711207_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Considering that Papua New Guinea is moving towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> more rapidly than most people imagine and the fact that this will increase the importance of localisation in all possible areas of responsibility, I ask the Minister for the Army: To what extent is the Army of Papua New Guinea localised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Money simultaneously represents ‘dependence’ and ‘<span class="highlight">independence</span>’: dependence to the extent that one can rely on it for obtaining the commodities one needs, and <span class="highlight">independence</span> because its ownership implies competence and self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within our society the position of economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the light of what I am putting to the House from sources regarded as fairly powerful authorities in the field of welfare work emphasises that reasonable money resources play a dominant role and is essential to the mental welfare of people in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The great difference between the paths taken by the 2 countries rests on how we use the tariff to promote our <span class="highlight">independence</span> economically and to promote our industries and employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a government wants certain goods its submits a request to a tender board which as an independent authority with all of the integrity of <span class="highlight">independence</span> makes a judgment on the best deal that the government can obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720307_reps_27_hor76/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very amusing that we are asked to enshrine such an outofdate provision in 1972 legislation, lt is asking rather much of the national Parliament of a country which is gradually moving towards some semblance of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in law making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not just mild Croatian <span class="highlight">independence</span> to which the Prime Minister refers when he says their cause is good, because their cause includes overthrowing by force the Government of Yugoslavia and their cause includes standing over Yugoslavs in this country by force and by threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They want <span class="highlight">independence</span> movements for countries and for peoples, as we do, who feel that they are being oppressed by the USSR or by the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia but they do not support <span class="highlight">independence</span> movements in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The desire for national <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the staunch expression of that desire, has enabled other non-communist countries in the region to become stronger, more stable and resilient and it has been Australia’s interest to help South Vietnam to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many developing countries, in particular, have aspired to own and operate national fleets on the grounds that large tonnages of their national products are carried by sea and that the possession of their own fleets will give them <span class="highlight">independence</span> and, by saving foreign exchange, will contribute to their balance of payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also wish to inform the House that the PostmasterGeneral,  Sir Alan  Hulme, is leaving Australia today to represent the Australian Government at the Tenth Anniversary <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Celebrations in Western Samoa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would say that in relation to timber we have to make sure that we are in a position of some <span class="highlight">independence</span> and strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Could the PostmasterGeneral give some definition of the phrase the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is progressively defining a long term programme of balanced force development which will ensure that in the changing circumstances of the future Australia will be able to act with the necessary measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> - both in peacetime and in war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill is a simple one, but it represents another step forward in Papua New Guinea’s movement to self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, on terms determined by the people of Papua New Guinea themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let industry beware that if a Labor government is elected the autonomy, the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, of the Tariff Board will be gone and gone forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  raised the question of the present duality that exists in the transition towards self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one does that one also makes a distinction between self government as such - de jure self government - and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important that people understand the distinction between self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, particularly when discussing Australia’s relationship with Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The watershed in Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea will come at <span class="highlight">independence</span> and not at self government, whether it be de jure or, indeed, de facto, because we have responsibilities to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the agreement is not executed until the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> - the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as distinct from any date for self government - and we maintain a role and are bound to do so under the terms of our agreement with the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having put that to the honourable member I say that it has been a view consistently stated by me that in regard to any functions prior to the attainment of self government and in regard to all functions still held by the Australian Government prior to the attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, I would seek the opinion of the Government of Papua New Guinea before exercising the power that was still residing with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that as the economic trend of planning and so on is developing <span class="highlight">independence</span> will come with expatriates owning about  90  per cent of secondary industry and indigenes owning about  10  per cent or less and expatriates owning  50  per cent of the value of agricultural production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we believe that this principle should be stated and we are anxious that in all possible arrangements the Commonwealth Government can make between now and <span class="highlight">independence</span> it should do its utmost to develop an indigenous equity in investment in Papua New Guinea.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite important that we, in our relationship with Papua New Guinea, should give the example when we are setting up a company, such as the one set out in the Bill, of ensuring that they have a decisive equity in that company because if they are to go into partnership with businessmen as astute as some of those operating around the world at the present time they may find that they will run into very serious trouble within a very few years of their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will remove the restraint previously placed upon students and allow them more <span class="highlight">independence</span> in managing their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s broad objectives in education are: Equality of opportunity; a healthy degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for, and variety in, tertiary education institutions; assistance for deprived groups; freedom of schools from excessively centralised control; development of parental and local community interest in schools; freedom of choice for ‘consumers’ of education; and a continuing improvement in the facilities available to teachers and students at all levels, in the content of courses and in the teaching methods applied in those courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the resources and the power to become a very great nation - let us say one of the top dozen - and by striving we can obtain greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> economically, socially and in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said on a television interview on Sunday night that the Government did not believe in political interference with either the staffing or the programming of the Australian Broadcasting Commission which, I believe, should be in exactly the same position, with respect to its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, as the universities should be with respect to theirs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people in our midst are prone to verbosity on the subject of our <span class="highlight">independence</span>, but apart from a brash defiance of others they never think out what <span class="highlight">independence</span> actually entails outside words and xenophobia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implicit in that statement is the obvious fact that the Australian Labor Party, if it should become the government, would take away the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Tariff Board, and it would be a Labor government that would be making judgments on levels of tariff protection in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These arrangements will not only remove from pensioners and their relatives the worry of meeting the costs of nursing home care but will also, I suggest, help to maintain the pensioners’ sense of personal <span class="highlight">independence</span> and dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These new nursing home and domiciliary care benefits, taken together with the other initiatives in the field of social welfare announced in the Budget, demonstrate the determination of the Government to correct imbalances of opportunity within the community and to assist those who need it to receive health care and comfort without loss of dignity or <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will notice the disproportionate favouring of hostels where there is more <span class="highlight">independence</span> and supportive care for an inmate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  will look at this matter very closely when he is in the Territory so that these people can be part of the establishment when they get <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 also think that if the present Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  had been Prime Minister any earlier we may not have reached the situation in which we are today, because I think that the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton)  was probably pushed by the Leader of the Opposition into coming out in favour- of early selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> - for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this matter is of paramount importance because Papua New Guinea is our closest neighbour, because shortly, as I have said, it will achieve self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, because that independent country may have to face enormous economic and political problems and last but not least, because there are many Australian nationals who will be involved in any changeover that takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the short time left to me I would like to say that I think a very much greater commitment for civil aid to be given to Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be stated by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that much of the opposition to <span class="highlight">independence</span> within Papua New Guinea has sprung from a fear amongst the people of that country that if it is given <span class="highlight">independence</span> Australia will up stumps and leave Papua <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721010_reps_27_hor81/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why has the Government failed to anticipate the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no lack of anticipation by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  about the coming <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct, as reported, that the Minister has stated that he has only noted this request, and is it correct that he will transfer this power only on certain conditions, one condition being that the transfer is revocable, in other words, that the power can be returned to the Australian Government at any time prior to Papua New Guinea gaining <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the same reason the Prime Minister is pushing <span class="highlight">independence</span> on Papua New Guinea before the Territory wants <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would prefer to have a situation in which <span class="highlight">independence</span> was forced upon Papua New Guinea before the people wanted it rather than to stand up to a little criticism from some who might still try to level a false colonial charge against Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>national interest and <span class="highlight">independence</span> are jeopardised by the continuance of the agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the independent Papua New Guinea Government has to be established during the lifetime of this Parliament, it seems to me that the decision about the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be left to  Mr Somare  and his colleagues, for they must be best placed to analyse this fragmentation problem to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others - and, I believe, a great majority - see it as a symbol of healthy <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that the Government will move with all due speed to create an independent, united Papua New Guinea, lt can insist on the country’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> but not on its unity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The timetable for self-government is fixed but not the timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our democratic way of life has allowed us to develop an <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought, speech and action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My division is an area where there is an <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the rural and city areas, each of which has a deep respect and appreciation of the other’s point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, in foreign affairs, that self-interest and an assertive <span class="highlight">independence</span> are not necessarily incompatible but can in fact be complementary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has been built on a great tradition of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, self-reliance and hard work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>that the Australian national interest and <span class="highlight">independence</span> are not jeopardised by the continuance of the agreements under which the installations remain in Australia, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to an out-of-hand declaration made by the Opposition that the Australian national interest and <span class="highlight">independence</span> are not jeopardised by the continuance of the agreements under which United States defence installations remain in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It made it clear that the Australian national interest and <span class="highlight">independence</span> were not jeopardised by the agreements under which these installations were allowed on Australian soil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his public declamation of the Board the Minister is seeking to convert that body - with its long-established history of <span class="highlight">independence</span> - to a rubber stamp for union demands and to force the Board to become the pacesetter for wages and conditions throughout the community; this, in spite of a very clear interpretation of intention in the Act that the Public Service should not be used for purposes of political patronage by whatever government happens to be in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the immediate and unconditional self-determination of Papua and New Guinea, I want to say that the Opposition believes in the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea, and it made this very clear when in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the attitude of the Prime Minister is that big brother knows best and that the Territory will get its <span class="highlight">independence</span> when he determines, whether the people of Papua New Guinea want it at that time or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that substantial sections of the population of Papua New Guinea would like to defer <span class="highlight">independence</span> beyond December this year, but apparently their wishes are to be entirely disregarded and they will receive their <span class="highlight">independence</span> when the Prime Minister determines, whether they are ready for it or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am confident that Thailand will continue the policies which for 100 years have ensured that, alone among the nations of South-East Asia, her identity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> have remained unbroken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Others who have established sound and understanding communication with their sons and daughters, will see in it the blossoming of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and character of their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that Government policy in this area should be designed to encourage and strengthen the capacity of Aborigines to manage their own affairs; to increase their economic <span class="highlight">independence</span>; to reduce their handicaps in health, housing, education, training and employment; and to promote their enjoyment of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tonight the Aboriginal people, emerging with a new pride and a new <span class="highlight">independence</span>, may take satisfaction from the fact that this last piece of discrimination on the national statute book has been removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Papua New Guinea is about to gain <span class="highlight">independence</span> and we cannot impose on Papua New Guinea a colonial boundary which will be a running sore for ail time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this, the 4-week affair’, the Board first had the principle of union favouritism foisted upon it and then had to face the blatant public attack upon its <span class="highlight">independence</span> by the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when the Board ruled that the extra week’s leave would be received only by those public servants who were members of a recognised union or association on 1st January this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole episode shows 3 things: Firstly, that the Minister has been cut down to size; secondly, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of the Public <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Opposition does not oppose the granting of 4 weeks annual leave to public servants, which will again put them in front of employees in private industry, it has a duty to expose the repudiation of an election promise; the attempted disruption of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service Board; the erroneous propositions of the Prime Minister and the dangerous consequences of pacesetting by the Commonwealth for private industry at the expense of established industrial tribunals througout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the introduction of this Bill the Government, in the view of the Opposition, deliberately sought to dishonour an election promise; to introduce the concept and application of compulsory unionism into the Public Service; to interfere with the longstanding <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of the Public Service Board; to avoid parliamentary approval of its policy and to set in motion the beginning of its long term design to use the Public Service as a pace-setter in the achievement of the Australian Labor Party’s industrial objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why are the Prime Minister and the Government flying in the face of popular opinion in Australia and Papua New Guinea by forcing that country into world markets and forcing <span class="highlight">independence</span> on it, especially when it has previously accepted help, guidance, assistance and advice from previous Australian governments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> are really a 2-phase operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Nations has laid down and has asked Australia to lay down a timetable for both self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, where there is a shared responsibility under the Act, the Commissioner is given greater protection and greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> from external pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister visited the Northern Territory before the election he said that he saw future political <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the Northern Territory as being part of its relationship with the Federal Parliament, but that this would only be defined after talks with local elected representatives if Labor won power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe I am correctly interpreting the words quoted as meaning ‘until <span class="highlight">independence</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware that the Treasurer in January this year gave an assurance that the Commonwealth guarantee will continue on all loans in existence at <span class="highlight">independence</span> until they are repaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the loan is also guaranteed by virtue of the statement of policy but the question arises whether loans negotiated after the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as distinct from those existing at that date will receive any guarantee from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are to be changes in Australia’s aid pattern after <span class="highlight">independence</span> these need to be considered and agreed to before then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, above all countries with which we are associated, Papua New Guinea needs special consideration as it moves through selfgovernment, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is coming will not mean an end to our assistance or indeed to our association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we had to provide guarantees, and the Australian Government has indicated that it will provide guarantees for all loans entered into on behalf of Papua New Guinea through to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not only in advance of <span class="highlight">independence</span>; it is also in advance of selfgovernment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each decision that we are now making in terms of self-government is being looked at from the point of view of the impact that it will have on Papua New Guinea in terms of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time we come to self-government, which the previous Government decided would be granted on 1st December 1973 and which we fully supported, and before Papua New Guinea gains <span class="highlight">independence</span> it will in fact have an international identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Papua New Guinea approaches self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> it is very necessary that the structuring of the budget - the budgetary practices - in Papua New Guinea be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We regard this as one of the important objectives in bringing Papua New Guinea to <span class="highlight">independence</span> smoothly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to maintain our <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and if we are to maintain our economic advancement, we need a sound international monetary system which essentially provides for a multilateral rather than a regional or bilateral approach to world financial arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has reaffirmed the agreement reached by the previous government with the Papua New Guinea Government on the timing for self-government and has indicated that it will work with all due speed to <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea in the closest consultation with the Papua New Guinea Government and the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part of the process of development towards the goals of self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> is the development of organs of government in Papua New Guinea to suit its particular circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As all constitutional and administrative decisions now made affecting Papua New Guinea must be decided in the light of the rapid approach of selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> the discussions were of value in helping to identify a number of matters requiring early resolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While matters such as defence and foreign affairs will not be transferred until <span class="highlight">independence</span> for constitutional reasons, some other matters are under consideration by the Constitutional Planning Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus by the time of <span class="highlight">independence</span> Papua New Guinea will be familiar with and have experience in all areas of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, although Australia will continue to be responsible for Papua New Guinea’s foreign affairs until <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea is beginning to assume a separate international identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, the Australian Government has every intention of seeing through the task which Australia undertook in Papua New Guinea not only in the period up to <span class="highlight">independence</span> but beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The handling of the movement towards self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> is most delicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now close to the stage where self government and then <span class="highlight">independence</span> will occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second step will be in the development of Australia and Papua New Guinean relations post-<span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The watershed between Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea will occur, after all, at <span class="highlight">independence</span> and not at self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There ought not to be a sudden break on the day of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is essential that the movement to self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> be as smooth and as orderly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ trust albeit that the Australian Labor Party has a policy on <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea that the Government will not arbitrarily or unilaterally determine the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be in response to the wishes of the people of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That must be the cardinal motivating factor in relations between our countries and in the movement of self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said in the earlier part of his statement that he and the Australian Government will work with all due speed toward <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea in the closest consultation with the Papua New Guinea Government and the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister made it clear during the debate on the Bill that the matters referred to were such things as aviation engineering work for outside organisations, the handling of Commonwealth contracts, the establishment and operation of hotels and other kinds of accommodation, the establishment and operation of road transport services, the acquisition of subsidiaries or shareholdings in companies or the establishment of subsidiaries for the purposes of the Australian National Airlines Commission, aerial work and charter operations, and operations in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what a misguided exercise of Australian <span class="highlight">independence</span> and national pride. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ignores the concept of public interest, it ignores the responsibilities of the principal parties in industrial relations, it ignores the disabling and deleterious effect of industrial unrest, it ignores the economic implications of industrial legislation and particularly the inflationary effects of this legislation, it ignores the vital role of the Commonwealth Public Service in relation to movements in wages and salaries in the general community, and it ignores the manner in which the Government has sought to cut across the traditional <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a symbol of our <span class="highlight">independence</span> and a guarantee of our nation’s continued dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reaction of the Australian Government fresh from receiving a strong mandate from the Australian people is to proclaim proudly our own <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to all members of the Parliament to build national unity, end discrimination and promote a proud <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any planning authority needs <span class="highlight">independence</span> in order to operate within the broad policy guidelines of the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We require a sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and freedom for the planners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, I urge him to respect the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Cities Commission and not to use it as a political tool of his Party or of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the guarantee will continue for the duration of the loan, that is, it will therefore continue after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this sense, it is akin to the guarantees given previously to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, but not to the Asian Development Bank which has never insisted on the condition that the loan continue until <span class="highlight">independence</span>, as I understand the IBRD does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is all very well in the present circumstance where the currencies of Australia and Papua New Guinea are one and the same, but what happens after <span class="highlight">independence</span> when the currencies may differ, if, for any reason, the parity between the currencies of the two countries differs, or in particular if, as so often happens with developing countries - I do not criticise them for so doing - it wants to devalue its currency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important that this policy should continue to be followed particularly before the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea and while Australian officials are still present to assist the officials of both countries in their mutual dealings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is also a matter of concern to the States and the Territory of Papua New Guinea, especially as the granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to Papua New Guinea is now being given earnest consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the Tariff Board, the Tribunal will be concerned with the analysis of the performance and efficiency of firms and industries, and like the Tariff Board it will have need of its own research staff to facilitate its work and guarantee its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No consideration has been given to <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Cocos Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anybody seriously believes that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be appropriate- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even when Britain gave a good deal of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to its colonies in the nineteenth century, it recognised that the control of shipping and like matters required uniform control to be effective, efficient and successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After <span class="highlight">independence</span> who knows what group of people from America, Japan, Canada, Russia, China or anywhere else will have a dominating say in the affairs of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter deals with aviation, Commonwealth contracts, tourist accommodation, road transport services, subsidiaries, aerial work, charter operations, investment of moneys not immediately required, operations in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> and amendments to the general financial arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Transport and Minister for Civil Aviation went on to say that the additional powers that the previous Government was contemplating giving to TransAustralia Airlines were, firstly, in aviation engineering work for outside organisations; secondly, in Commonwealth contracts; thirdly, in the establishment and operation of hotels and other kinds of accommodation; fourthly, in the establishment and operation of road transport services; fifthly, iri the acquisition of shareholdings; sixthly, in the field of aerial work and charter operations; and, seventhly, in operations in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixthly, will TAA be able to operate internationally, for example in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and if so will TAA be immune from taxation in Papua New Guinea under this Bill and did the Papua New Guinea Government agree to this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that this Bill will, if passed by this Parliament, apply now so that when <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the next few years comes, the Papua New Guinea Government will have to negotiate with established operations in that country served by TAA and started there without consultation with its Government and after the Minister for Territories has said it is in charge of its own transport policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This wording is an insult to the whole <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is forcing <span class="highlight">independence</span> upon Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, they will remove the power of the Minister for External Territories under section 30 to appoint officers and engage persons on contract for the Public Service, thus enabling Papua New Guinea to legislate to develop its own national public service - an essential authority for a country approaching full selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Papua New Guinea Government has indicated that it wants to retain the services of many of these officers and that it sees a continuing need for staff from Australia for some years beyond <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for Papua New Guinea to be able to retain a solid core of experienced overseas permanent and contract officers until <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and thereafter; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to provide  overeas  officers with just compensation for any loss of career or premature termination of services as a result of Papua New Guinea’s rapid progress towards selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Simpson’s  report had not been supported by the previous Government and endorsed by the present Government, I am certain that Papua New Guinea would have been totally unable to deal with emergency situations such as last year’s famine or with the extensive program for selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I want to refer to the movement in Papua New Guinea to self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If local government is to develop attractively and flexibly it must have financial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be thought and properly argued that local government has now reached an age and a measure of power, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and influence sufficient to enable it to carry out its wider community responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But power cannot be effectively exercised without financial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the great erosions of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the States was the transfer of their taxing powers to Canberra so that they became financial clients of the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This naturally gives them a much higher degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member will be aware it is government policy to guarantee political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the ABC However, I have brought the honourable member’s suggestion to the attention of the  Chairman  of the ABC for consideration by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-52-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation which will follow the Council’s final report will be designed not merely to improve the material conditions of those engaged in them and to widen the range of those who participate but to guarantee to the arts the <span class="highlight">independence</span> without which they cannot flourish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case, whether that distinction is accepted or not, the truth is that, on the authority of the Uniform Tax Cases, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the States can be destroyed in a perfectly legal manner by a combination of the Commonwealth’s taxing power and grants power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rating system, until recently, provided an adequate and appropriate method of finance which has allowed them to preserve their financial autonomy and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no intention on the part of this Government to delay <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TAA is now able to engage in aviation engineering works for outside organisations, Commonwealth contracts, acquisition of shareholdings, aerial work and charter work and will be able to operate in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our civil aid and defence policies will have a particular bearing on Australia’s future relationship with Papua New Guinea, whose <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be achieved, I confidently expect, in the closest consultation with the Government and House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea by 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period before <span class="highlight">independence</span> the Government will do everything possible to meet Australia’s obligations under the Trusteeship Agreement and to ensure the smooth and amicable transfer of power to the government of a United Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also anxious that outstanding questions relating to Papua New Guinea’s borders should be settled at an early date so that, when <span class="highlight">independence</span> is attained, Papua New Guinea’s relations with her near neighbours will not be plagued by the kind of territorial disputes which in other parts of the world have done so much to hinder the development of fruitful and mutually beneficial relations between close neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that despite my Government’s best endeavours early progress towards agreement on the border between Australia and Papua New Guinea seems unlikely and final agreement may have to await Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he consider that the commissioning of independent research and survey work is essential to the continuing <span class="highlight">independence</span> and objectivity of the Tariff Board? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Government has on a number of occasions sought to interfere with the traditional and long established <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It derives its <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the belief that no government can operate without certain restraints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this is a wise provision, giving <span class="highlight">independence</span> and with the appearance of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that an agreement has been reached with the Chief Minister on this matter so that there will be no upset with its Public Service and police force when Papua New Guinea finally gains its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for External Territories seems more in haste to obtain Australian <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Papua New Guinea than he is in helping the Territory in a responsible way to attain its own <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, if Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> became fragmented and if, for example, Bougainville separated and approaches to Bougainville were made by some great power for the concession of a naval base in return for aid, this again could have implications for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was we who took the initiative in opposing our participation in the Vietnam conflict, in calling for more foreign aid, in proposing an end to racism in our international dealings, in co-operating with the movement of self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea and in opening up normal relations with China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Department of Defence prepared adequate contingency plans to be ready to deploy forces in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, New Britain or Bougainville if any rebellion breaks out there after <span class="highlight">independence</span> and proves too strong for the authorities at Port Moresby to deal with? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ASEAN governments have been discussing proposals for a ‘zone of peace, freedom and neutrality’ in South East Asia that would preserve their security and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and allow them to pursue their national and regional development free from disruption by military confrontation in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Papua New Guinea there is now a clear movement towards final <span class="highlight">independence</span> and we are closely involved with the Government there in discussions about the development of its defence force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This broadening of its authority reflects current practice agreed by the previous Government and this Government that when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes there will be no area of government in which Papua New Guinea will be unfamiliar or lack experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These Bills, the adoption of the constitution and subsequent amendment of the Papua New Guinea Act next year, and the final step of <span class="highlight">independence</span> are all integral stages in the continuous development of Papua New Guinea from dependency to nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the timing of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the Council noted Australia’s view that there are 2 elements involved in the determination of the question of <span class="highlight">independence</span>: The view of Australia and the views of the people of Papua New Guinea as expressed through their elected representatives in the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council noted that Australia expects <span class="highlight">independence</span> to come by 1975 and that it should be achieved in the closest consultation with the Government and the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the House that the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 asked Australia to fix a timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span> in consultation with Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council further noted that Australia did not disagree with the view of the House of Assembly that Papua New Guinea should experience a period of self-government before a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> is set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One might have turned to those words not necessarily because they were superimposed above the monarch’s head on the coinage of the realm but because those words designated in their way an apparent protector of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of worship and an apparent recognition that there is within this realm an opportunity to practice or to adhere to whatever religions denomination or persuasion people might seek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With effect from 10 July 1973, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas achieved <span class="highlight">independence</span> and became known as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am making the point that we are happy to have recognised the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also know from that survey that there was confusion about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Australia and the status of the Queen of Australia with a colonial status related to England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we in this Parliament know and appreciate the difference here, but it is evident that some members even now have not grasped the significance of Australian <span class="highlight">independence</span> or the status of the Queen of Australia which the monarch has expressly said she is attached to and which she prefers as a title for use in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, then, any move that is going to enable the handicapped to achieve some measure of economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> is going to be in the interests, not only of the handicapped people themselves, but of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, if one reads the case history of this country and elsewhere one could gain the impression that that is not at all the case and that those who argue that legal practitioners have sole responsibility for the reservoir of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, integrity and impartiality are doomed to serious disappointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is most important, however, that people recognise the fundamental distinction between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I continue my remarks tomorrow I will point out certain differences in approach between this government and the previous Government in relation to the post selfgovernment situation - in other words the preindpendence and then post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not necessarily subscribe to that view but in any case the Government has adopted the attitude - the Government has not put it to us but we have had to glean it from a number of remarks - that internal security and the power over internal security will pass to Papua New Guinea during the period from selfgovernment to <span class="highlight">independence</span> or prior to 1 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most former British dependencies the British Government, through the Governor, retained ultimate responsibility for internal security up until the time of <span class="highlight">independence</span> itself, but whatever arrangements were arrived at prior to that date seem to have been based upon the particular situation in each dependency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred to the need for study and consultations with and increased responsibility by Papua New Guinea authorities in defence matters right up to the time of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to be advised of the concepts for the future role and deployment of the Papua New Guinea forces in a post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> situation as it is seen by both the Papua New Guinea Government and the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard little or nothing from the Minister for Defence about either the matters I have mentioned or the financial arrangements on defence between Papua New Guinea and Australia in the period of internal selfgovernment and at <span class="highlight">independence</span> - that is, between 1 December and whatever date is agreed upon for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That leads me to a couple of points of criticism that I make of the present Government relating to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members are singularly uninformed on the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we have is statements about <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the life of the Australian Parliament - that must have as much relevance to the progress of Papua New Guinea as has the life of the Norwegian Parliament - and statements earlier in the year by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be reached some time in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was contradicted, and properly so, by the Chief Minister who said that he wanted to experience a period of selfgovernment before determining the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had statements by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that Australia will share equally in the determination of the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be determined, at least in the practical sense, by consultation between Papua New Guinea and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought not to be imposing the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> on Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be placing stresses on Papua New Guinea instead of easing it along the road towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> and continuing the smooth and orderly transition towards self-government which was being carried on under the previous Government’s administration of the Territory and, in fairness, under the moves towards selfgovernment by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said on Wednesday, we must distinguish between selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further criticism that I have regarding <span class="highlight">independence</span> is that it is inconceivable to me that this Government should allow Papua New Guinea to be shortly approaching the stage of <span class="highlight">independence</span> without determining what the basic relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea will be when that country reaches the stage of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, or when the watershed actually occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not occur on self-government; it will occur on <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it is the height of foolishness and crass stupidity, apart from maladministration, to be thinking that we can reach a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and then determine relations as if we were pressing a computer button. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1 December and <span class="highlight">independence</span> Australia will be dealing with defence and foreign affairs matters on behalf of Papua New Guinea but in conjunction with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being given sparse information as to what relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia after <span class="highlight">independence</span> are foreseen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has happened not only in relation to these talks and the talks on <span class="highlight">independence</span> which 1 mentioned a little earlier in my speech, but also in the disagreement over the airport proposals and the disagreement over the nature of aid programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This does not affect the date on which selfgovernment will come into operation but it may jeopardise relations in a postselfgovernment pre-<span class="highlight">independence</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore mutual discussion should be held now to determine the form which relations with other countries should take as well as with Papua New Guinea in a postindependence situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In working towards selfgovernment and later <span class="highlight">independence</span>, we are discarding the former relationship of an administering authority and an administered country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people would regard Papua New Guinea’s movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> at the present moment as exciting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The association between our 2 countries cannot end at <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to be taking steps now to determine what our relations with Papua New Guinea will be after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must look beyond the stage of self-government and, as I stressed to the Government, beyond the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that Australia can be proud of the role she has played in moving towards self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea but that does not mean that she should be looking for thanks from Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, on behalf of the Opposition - and I am sure that those honourable members who follow me in this debate will say the same - I wish well the Government of Papua New Guinea and the institution of the House of Assembly in their relations with this current Australian Government as they move towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many still assume that unless Papua New Guinea is identical in form to Australia that country will not be ready for self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe they are possessed of enough talent, ability and skills to handle selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing is the problems of the highlanders who supposedly are opposed to self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is much value in speeding to self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they do get <span class="highlight">independence</span> it has to be total <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel that the present Government is forcing Papua New Guinea into an international void by pushing it too fast towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to force it into this international void of <span class="highlight">independence</span> early next year - I believe this is the Government’s proposal - is certainly substantive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Government has acceded to that request and said: ‘We will make certain that Chief Minister Somare, his Ministers and his Government reach <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1974’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is self-government as envisaged by the Australian Government a means by which we can dictate our form of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and our policies to the Government of Papua New Guinea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But until and unless the Government of Papua New Guinea reaches the point where it asks for that advice, we should let it tread its steps first to self-government and ultimately to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in its own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel certain that there is in Australia a rising feeling of opinion that the present Australian Government is forcing <span class="highlight">independence</span> on Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> for Papua New Guinea would be little more than a tidying up exercise as <span class="highlight">independence</span> flows on readily from self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement indicates not only to Australians but also to the people of Papua New Guinea that there is very little difference between self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a speech which he made on 9 May 1972 and which is reported in Hansard at page 2203 the Prime Minister, when talking about selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this sense it is true that the people of New Guinea will decide their own timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words the people of Papua New Guinea would decide when they should reach <span class="highlight">independence</span>, not the Minister or the Government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will have deduced from what I have said that the Australian Government does not favour a long interval between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for External Territories: What are we doing to this country in forcing it quickly into <span class="highlight">independence</span> when obviously the people are not ready for it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the statement went on to say that Aus tralia would work towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> early in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the discussions the Chief Minister emphasised that until Papua New Guinea had progressed further towards self government his Government would be reluctant to enter into any firm commitment on a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> is a word that, in a colony, should be a word of hope and promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as  Mr Somare,  his Ministers, the Parliament and the people of Papua New Guinea are concerned, <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be a word of hope and promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To us <span class="highlight">independence</span> is a new word and that in itself is sufficient to worry about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They fear that all Australians will leave when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes, taking with them .their moneys, businesses and expertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we have done has been to say that <span class="highlight">independence</span> must come early in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no discussion with the Government of Papua New Guinea in relation to the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> or in relation to the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it clear that these Bills are part of a consistent policy by both the former Government and the present Government in the move towards complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am well aware that many members of this House have paid many visits to Papua New Guinea and know a great deal more about it than I do; but I think it was important that the Australian Parliament was represented in this way as Papua New Guinea approaches very shortly self-government and finally <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> will come to Papua New Guinea when the people of Papua New Guinea decide that it is time for them to have it <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to mention briefly the local government situation and the feelings of trepidation that we , noted about the approach of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that given that sort of assistance and assurances the move both to self-government and to <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be a relatively smooth one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soon Papua New Guinea will achieve <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the accusation has been made against those people who say ‘Hasten slowly’ that they desire to keep control of these people and do not want to give them <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should also give some consideration to the fact that people who are stressing that they are anti-colonialist and want to give the people of Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">independence</span> are advocating something that is even more detrimental than colonialism, that is, pushing people or rushing people into <span class="highlight">independence</span> before they are prepared for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this circumstance, surely the people who should make the ultimate decision are those to whom we are giving <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was made by the honourable member for Balaclava that on the one hand the Government is saying: ‘We are going to give these people and this country <span class="highlight">independence</span> on date X irrespective of whether they want it’, yet the moment those people say that they want to do something on their own, that they want to establish this airline and participate in it, this Government immediately steps in and says that they will not do it unless they do it the way the Government wants it done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact remains that this Government has to be careful lest it create a problem in regard to <span class="highlight">independence</span> rather than a partnership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this goodwill continues to be shown <span class="highlight">independence</span> will occur to the advantage of the people of Papua New Guinea as well as the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I hope, as I said, that <span class="highlight">independence</span> will proceed to the advantage of both Australia and the people of Papua <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By agreement with Papua New Guinea, defence and foreign relations will remain reserved to Australia until <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia ought to be able to avoid circumstances of that nature if we are prepared to enter into contractual arrangements with Papua New Guinea at the time of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this will be something we will have to face up to and it will have to be done in the interests not only of the Territory for the first decade of its <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also in the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia for that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not at all concerned about that situation because it encourages me to believe that the Government of Papua New Guinea, during the year or so prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and in the years following <span class="highlight">independence</span>, will be loath to spend money on military equipment and also to believe that the Australian people prefer to be in the position where they are able to recognise, in some way or another - perhaps by some mutual defence treaty or agreement - that we will be prepared to look after the external relations of Papua New Guinea conjointly in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply - I believe that it has been encouraging for all of us to see the sense of responsibility with which this House has approached what is in fact an historic act in providing for the self-government and eventual <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian colony of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We members of the Australian Labor Party, mindful of this experience, decided not this year but several years ago that our policy would be to bring Papua New Guinea to self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> not through conflict but by the colonial power saying: ‘We believe that you have a right to make your decisions in your own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will assist you in achieving <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not resist your movement to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will provide all the facilities for you to gain self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said then that Papua New Guinea was ready for self-government and that <span class="highlight">independence</span> was not that far off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>United Nations pressure the possibility of selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, treated it with no degree of urgency and provided no timetable for the achievement of either self-government or <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He campaigned, as the leader of the Pangu Party, for self-government and eventual <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that as Australians we can all be proud that we are bringing Papua New Guinea to <span class="highlight">independence</span> not through conflict or violence but through constitutional procedures in this House and in the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy is that the date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be achieved in the closest consultation with the Government of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Special Committee endorses the view that the House of Assembly, as the duly elected representatives of the people of Papua New Guinea, in consultation with the administering Power, should decide the date for the attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Territory in the light of General Assembly resolution 2977 (XXVII) of 14 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to that resolution, the Special Committee calls upon the administering Power, in consultation with the Government of Papua New Guinea, to prepare a timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak of  Sir Robert  Menzies who, back in I960, I think, made the observation that if there is to be <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea it is better sooner rather than later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accusation has been made, somewhat lightly, I suppose, as there was not a great deal of sincerity in the viewpoint put by various speakers, that we are rushing into <span class="highlight">independence</span> and that we are not providing sufficient opportunities and facilities for Papua New Guinea to play its part. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been our policy, it is our policy and it will continue to be our policy to give Papua New Guinea an international identity not only before <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also before self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other countries such as New Zealand, Germany and Japan are discussing with Papua New Guinea the establishment of representation in Papua New Guinea ahead of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the whole range of our activities, we have been planning not just for self- government but for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact in May 1973 the Papua New Guinea Government issued policy guidelines in proceeding with the defence arrangements after the achievment of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the ministerial arrangements after 1 December 1973 as this is all part of the forward planning to ensure the smooth transfer from self-government through to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe these ministerial arrangements are a measure of the degree of forward planning for which this Government has been responsible in the approach to this very important matter of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this period between selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> there will be a Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to matters affecting Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister Assisting, in consultation with other Ministers who have a responsibility for particular subjects involved, will co-ordinate the negotiation of such agreements between Australia and Papua New Guinea as may be needed between now and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister Assisting will also coordinate the activities of the relevant Australian departments in regard to the final stages of the handing over of powers to the Papua New Guinea Government and the final steps to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the main workload for specific functions will fall on relevant departments and the Australian Development Assistance Agency, the Minister Assisting will have a small unit to assist him in the interim period to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the period between 1968 and 1973 the Commonwealth Government has recognised that persons of Aboriginal descent experience a number of disabilities in comparison with the rest of the community and that special measures are needed to overcome their disabilities, lt has been said that programs have been evolved which are designed to encourage and strengthen the capacity of persons of Aboriginal descent to manage their own affairs as individuals, groups and local communities to increase their economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to reduce social and other handicaps facing them in health, housing and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It enables these people to live their lives as a part of the community with the maximum of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, freedom and comfort possible in old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament would soon learn that it could not itself possibly deal with all aspects of employment, and it would establish authorities which would be given such <span class="highlight">independence</span> in tenure as Parliament thought proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government forced Papua New Guinea along the road to self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> at a speed at which the people of that country did not want to travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Using a word that the Minister used so freely in his speech, I refer to the hypocrisy of the attitude of this Government when one sees what it is doing in Papua New Guinea by speeding it to selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and compare that with the callous attitude of the Minister towards the people of these 2 Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this time, when so much is being done to give a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to school communities and so much is being done to involve the parents in school councils or welfare clubs, assistance needs to be given in those deprived schools where there is this cultural gap to enable the school council, welfare club or parent group to ensure that people do not stay away because of a nervousness or fear that they will expose their lack of appreciation and understanding of the education process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that our distinctiveness lies in four features: Our <span class="highlight">independence</span> from government interference, our mandate to conduct our operations in anticipation of profit, our potential size and the fact that a mechanism exists for Government participation in the Corporation to be scaled down by the Directors to not more than 10 per cent at any time.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Originally the advocacy of protection was closely related to the view that national <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the welfare of wage earners in this country would be promoted by the effect of tariffs in redistributing income from the owners of land to industrial labour and capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In their attempts to apply the same standards of dishonesty to assistance to certain sectors of secondary industry - usually those marked by monopoly, inefficiency, and foreign ownership - which they were accustomed to in the rural sector, the Country Party Ministers did their best, by way of loaded policy references and unofficial pressures placed upon the Public Service, to undermine the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Erosion of State financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and authority has been gradual but inexorable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both the loss of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and dissipation of responsibility could be lessened if either the States passed over some of their powers or alternatively gained a new measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many people in Papua New Guinea had been wrongly led to believe that self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> would mean that Australia would be getting out and leaving Papua New Guinea in the lurch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large item in our aid to Papua New Guinea is for emoluments of the Australians who were appointed to the Papua New Guinea Public Service by the Australian Government and whose services will be required after selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> until Papua New Guineans are ready to take their places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been Australia’s aim that Papua New Guinea should, as soon as possible, achieve a much greater degree of financial and economic viability than it now has, but the Australian Government has given the Papua New Guinea Government an assurance that, it is prepared to continue providing substantial aid not only up to <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather we should value the interchange as an acknowledgment of our importance and that the leaders of the world now respect a government in Australia determined to explore every opportunity within the framework of national <span class="highlight">independence</span> and regional and international flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent statement by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  regarding the <span class="highlight">independence</span> timetable clearly shows that, despite our eagerness to give an early opportunity for self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Papua New Guinea, we are keenly aware of the need to co-operate with those whose responsibility it will be to effect the completion of the task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it interesting to ponder the expressions of members of the Australian Labor Party and to note the way in which they identify Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> as being manifested by some various form of international impertinence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that I regard the manifestation of this fear as a little more servile than that type of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which was being referred to by the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Oldmeadow). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not drifting into anyone’s orbit and our approach and actions on some recent matters have reflected maturity more than <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question asked there is: Why cannot Australia, after supporting the Vietnamese for so long, continue to support them in their struggle for <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is called the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration of the Granting of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Colonial Countries and Peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He explained that most of this increase would occur in relation to aid to Papua New Guinea and that it relates to that country’s movement towards self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But in regard to <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea I believe that Australia should not fix the date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am thus suggesting that Australia will need to face the preparation of both a general <span class="highlight">independence</span> treaty and a defence agreement, the terms of which should be worked out with the Papua New Guinea government and publicised in both countries so that people can digest them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it seems to me that <span class="highlight">independence</span> will demand this sort of operation, and that it should constitute the main task in the interval between full self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party seems to think that by attacking the United States it is adopting a stance of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which will command the admiration of the entire world and that by attacking the United States we might neutralise some of the suspicions that some countries have about Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because those workers do have an <span class="highlight">independence</span> in their areas of operation and are able to publish their reports freely, the BAE has been able to attract a high quality of research worker - people who find great satisfaction from their work in this organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee of Twenty-Four is the short title for a committee of the United Nations - I again ask honourable members to bear in mind that today is United Nations day - which is the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of a Declaration on the Granting of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Colonial Countries and Peoples. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although in recent years it must be conceded that this <span class="highlight">independence</span> has been challenged, and indeed on many occasions has been threatened, by some very curious and spurious suggestions, the first Minister for the Media,  Senator Douglas  McClelland, has made it clear that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission will be guaranteed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having in mind the considerations which constrained the States, particularly the less populated States, to demand as the price of federation an Upper House with powers to exercise independent judgment in order to protect the interests of the States, it is inconceivable that those same States would agree to weaken the Senate by destroying its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that a case can be set out for the retention of that <span class="highlight">independence</span>, related alone to the fact that when elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives are out of phase people register a more meaningful vote for their senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I think there is no greater fallacy than that which has been perpetrated by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  namely, that the initiative of a new sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in foreign policy, a new sense of Australian identity, is seen to be Labor in origin and motivated largely during the term of his own occupancy of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see this as a form of decentralisation, as a breakdown in the excessive bureaucratisation of education and as placing upon the adminstrators of teachers colleges a greater responsibility because they will be independent organisations more so than at any stage in the past and therefore have not only the right but also the responsibility to live up to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> with which they are to be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the most unacceptable alternative would be to allow our dependence on overseas supplies to increase, with a consequent loss of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in foreign policy, and a growing economic reliance on a politically unstable source of supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But less than 4 years ago the then Australian Government regarded self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> as a remote possibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  proposal for early self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> was met with official hostility and public dismay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papua New Guinea has attained self-government and is moving to <span class="highlight">independence</span> by orderly constitutional procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will, as the Prime Minister has stated publicly and unequivocally, continue to provide assistance to Papua New Guinea up to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The date of the next step- that of <span class="highlight">independence</span> - has become a subject of some controversy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this I merely wish to say today that the prime determinant of the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be the desire of the people of Papua New Guinea as expressed by the leadership group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> should not represent a sudden break from one status to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has long held the view that there should be a smooth and orderly transition which establishes Papua New Guinea by the time of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as a state able to manage its own affairs with a government responsive to the wishes of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need to plan ahead to avoid the hangover that so often follows the intoxication of emotional <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this Saturday, 1 December, in the period between self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> the Government of Papua New Guinea will be responsible for all domestic matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 1 December and <span class="highlight">independence</span> Australia will be dealing with defence and foreign affairs matters on behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government and its people but also in conjunction wim them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms of this relationship will, I hope, be planned and some elements of it negotiated before the actual date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be remiss if we found ourselves completing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea without adequate preparation for the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to look beyond Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the future relationship and to the form of the future relationship between the 2 countries is urgent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both these international forums it is expected that Papua New Guinea, on the attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span> will take its rightful place as a sovereign nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I believe that it is important that, Papua New Guinea having attained selfgovernment, the good will that has been in existence between our 2 countries is preserved during this next transition stage in the move towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> and in the period thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope that in this transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span> a capacity is developed within the people of Papua New Guinea which will enable them to accept the greater responsibilities which the final step will involve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that Western Australia will be able to retain its position of monetary <span class="highlight">independence</span> without the need to apply again to the Grants Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part IV of the Bill provides <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Authority in the employment of its staff and in the determination of conditions of service, in accordance with the usual practice of the Government in relation to authorities which are primarily engaged in business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States colonies used it in one form or another before <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we reject the motion because there is no substance in it, there is no general support for it in the community and, above all, it is merely another device to deny Australia a badge of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The United States of America national anthem evolved as a song during that country’s struggle for <span class="highlight">independence</span>; it was not as a result of a competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hayden’s scheme will become bogged down with a dispirited corps of doctors who are trained to be independent in their practice management, but who will be denied that <span class="highlight">independence</span> under these proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The heavy hand of hospital controllers and the lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span> have led to high staff resignations and staff going south. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals for private hospitals will not diminish their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The expression ‘Southern Rhodesia’ refers to the British Colony whose unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1965 has never been recognised either by the British Government or by any member of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Above all my Government believes in those abiding virtues in Australian society which have given us a distinctive nationhood, the belief in fraternity and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the instinct for fair play, justice and freedom that Eureka signifies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is those virtues which Australia’s foreign policies have sought to embody over the last year; it is that <span class="highlight">independence</span> which my Government has celebrated and revived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>And as should have been well known, Tun Razak, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who so recently duchessed the Prime Minister in Kuala Lumpur, and not so long ago duchessed me as well, the author of the idea of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality, has stated over and over again that his proposals are for the distant future and will require the guarantees of security, territorial integrity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> by the super powers, the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>History has proven that encouragement of the individual to feel free and equal and to stand on his own feet and not depend entirely on big brother goes hand in hand with a proper sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and pride in oneself and in one’s country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of this Government is to undermine the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and responsibility of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State governments must maintain their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and we as a government will ensure that they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papua New Guinea is on the tracks to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and it is being financially supported by this Government so that it can achieve its ends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the Chief Minister foreshadowing an <span class="highlight">independence</span> date for Papua New Guinea, what are the Prime Minister’s intentions for the non-self governing territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister will recall directing the Australian representatives at the United Nations to support a General Assembly resolution which called for the selfdetermination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Cocos Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He may also recall contradicting this intention when he said in this House last year - I agree with him - that nobody seriously believed that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be appropriate for the Cocos Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the United Nations Special Committee of Twenty-four is soon to visit the Cocos Islands - the nature of that committee’s work is well known - what advice will be given to it by Australia about <span class="highlight">independence</span> or not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will be aware that the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea,  Mr Somare,  announced in the House of Assembly on 12 March that it was the intention of his Government to move in the April sittings of the House for <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea on 1 December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Nations in its resolution of 12 December 1973 noted that ‘the House of Assembly has affirmed its right as the duly elected Parliament of the People of Papua New Guinea to decide when <span class="highlight">independence</span> is to come and that the administering power accepts that the House of Assembly represents the wishes of the people on the question of <span class="highlight">independence</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In foreshadowing his intention to seek <span class="highlight">independence</span> on 1 December 1974,  Mr Somare  stated that the step to <span class="highlight">independence</span> was a small one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span> flows readily from self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increasing recognition of Papua New Guinea’s international status is indicated by the number of foreign consulates that have already, ahead of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, been established in Port Moresby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Short of <span class="highlight">independence</span> Australia must retain authority in these fields, but it has been the Australian Government’s policy to devolve steadily increasing responsibility to Papua New Guinea, with the concurrence of the Papua New Guinea Government and consistently with the retention of ultimate authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the experience which Papua New Guinea has gained in the exercise of these responsibilities will stand the country in good stead in the years after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is backing Papua New Guinea’s potential by giving positive manpower and financial support to underpin Papua New Guinea’s improvement program and to assist in the early years of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the commitment is to underpin the Papua New Guinea Government’s new improvement program and to assist Papua New Guinea in the early years after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Somare  in referring to the proposed <span class="highlight">independence</span> date on 1 December has stated that it will give the House ample time to debate fully and to enact a Papua New Guinea home grown Constitution to guide it after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem appropriate that a Papua New Guinea home grown Constitution should come into effect at <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure this House and the Australian people that the Australian Government will devote itself to ensuring that the final steps to <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be achieved smoothly and in a spirit of goodwill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the final arbiters regarding the decision of a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be the members of the House of Assembly in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout our period in Opposition I have consistently pointed to the consistent policy of the Liberal Party when in Government that the decision on the date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> must not rest with this Parliament but with the Parliament in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, on ‘behalf of the Liberal Party since we have been in Opposition and following the viewpoints that I expressed when previously I was Minister for External Territories, I said that not only did we have a duty to ensure the smooth and orderly transition through self-government to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Papua New Guinea, but also we had a basic duty to ensure that both Papua New Guinea and Australia fully understood the nature of the relationship in a post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> situation; that it would not be good enough to arrive at a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and pass through it and then start discussions on the nature of the relationship between the then independent country of Papua New Guinea and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  who is culpable to the Australian nation for not advising this Parliament and the Australian people of what steps have been taken to determine the size, structure and role of the Papua New Guinea defence forces during this period of self-government prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> when I would remind honourable members that we are still internationally responsible and answerable to the United Nations for matters of internal security but particularly of defence security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian servicemen are involved in the Pacific Islands Regiment and they will continue to be involved after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a duty to do it prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and he has not executed that duty in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warmly endorse and was a party to the motivation towards self-government and the move towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will now have to wait until after <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the matter to be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take note that there will be some in the independent country of Papua New Guinea - if they decide that 1 December is to be their date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> - who will not tolerate dogmatic views that this Government with a stroke of a pen can change these boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be resolved only by negotiation and I wish the Government would pull its head out of the sand and recognise what it will have to face after 1 December if it does not discuss these 2 specific areas plus others in the nature of post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> does come, it will signify the last step in a long process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the actual movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> will contribute greatly to the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> period, if there are discussions on matters such as I have mentioned and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were in government we hoped to arrive at a situation prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> where, because of the progressive involvement of Papua New Guinea leaders in the whole range of government activities and responsibilities there would be no sphere in which the newly independent country would find itself unfamiliar or lacking experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Papua New Guinea Act that we will have to ensure that there is an orderly legislative movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">independence</span> does come it will come I trust with a great deal of goodwill on both sides, notwithstanding what I said before which had to be said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that both the Liberal Party and the Country Party will do all in their power to ensure that the unique and special relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea continues irrespective of the manner in which the movement is taken towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timing of the transition from self government to <span class="highlight">independence</span> is a matter for the House of Assembly and the people of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments, and parties on both sides of this House, however, have rightly seen the necessity for the transition of Papua New Guinea as soon as possible to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the date for which has been proclaimed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hard for us sitting here perhaps to make a judgment about the capacity of the country to meet the traumas of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the unhappy circumstances of the movement into <span class="highlight">independence</span> by other former colonial countries throughout the world has led many people to be apprehensive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first that worries me is the degree to which there have been between the Government of Australia and the now self governing body that controls Papua New Guinea discussions about the way in which relations in the areas remaining to be resolved could be concluded before <span class="highlight">independence</span> is achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first area is the role of the Regiment which operates in Papua New Guinea and which was initially entirely under Australian control and command but which has a progression through the ranks of indigenous Papuans and New Guineans and which until <span class="highlight">independence</span> will still remain the responsibility of the Government of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I agree completely with the concern expressed by my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong about the failure of this Government to enter into meaningful discussions which might reasonably have been concluded by whatever date - be it 1 December or any other date - is finally accepted by the House of Assembly as the date for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that these deficiences will be recognised by the Government of Papua New Guinea and that there will be an insurance that, in the development of educational facilities in this about to be independent country, there will not be the ill consequences that seem to have befallen so many other countries moving into <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One hopes that it is possible that there be maintained a very strong fraternal relationship in the evolution of foreign policy which, passing as it will from the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Government of Papua New Guinea, can still involve a measure of consultation which will ensure that Australia can assist Papua New Guinea in the formulation of the new relationships which one hopes can lead to the achievement of the objectives about which I have just spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ethnic divisions that exist in Papua New Guinea, the problems of communication, the divisions that are unfortunately apparent between the people of Papua and those of New Guinea and the concern that many people in several areas of Papua New Guinea feel about the move into <span class="highlight">independence</span> are problems that today will and henceforth be the responsibility of the Government of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to compliment  Mr Michael  Somare, the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea, for the way in which and by which he has been able to unite these different factions and differing ethnic peoples in this transition today into self-government and tomorrow into <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this fraternal relationship at a personal level is imperative at a stage where, regrettably, there is still a weakness in the infrastructures of Papua New Guinea as it moves in this final step to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On each occasion it has been made clear to us that the responsibility for internal security in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be the responsibility of those authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in addition, we discussed the continuing aid to be provided by the Australian Department of Defence to Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>, particularly in terms of essential equipment that would be required by that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in this respect, there have been meaningful discussions on the role of the police force in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> and, again, assistance will be provided to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by pointing out to the honourable member for Kooyong that it would not be possible for one to make any statement in the House on what are very important matters for the Papua New Guinea Government, particularly in relation to defence and our aid program for defence to Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> which, as I have said, will continue, until these discussions with the responsible Ministers in Papua New Guinea have been concluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are within months of the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the Minister still cannot tell us what has been determined for Australian servicemen in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when Whitlam finally passed through Australia’s neighbourhood it was after visits to London and Washington, notwithstanding the promised degree of greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the former imperialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we can elaborate on this <span class="highlight">independence</span> when we look at our behaviour in the United Nations Organisation, which is a body in which the Australian Government passionately believes, where recently I believe the World Association of World Federalists put Australia, New Zealand and Cyprus highest on the scale they had set up in terms of the 20 most important issues discussed before the United Nations in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister talks of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as if he had just invented it or we had just achieved it, and his colleague the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  busily destroys one of the fundamental requirements of effective <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment, during the period between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let him challenge the statistics released by the Library, whose integrity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> I do not think he would query. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Deputy Chairman  of the Public Works Committee and as a former Minister for Works he spoke of the damage done to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wakefield was especially concerned about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the activities of the Public Works Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">independence</span> should not be trammelled by any political motivation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that <span class="highlight">independence</span> which he seeks to uphold in this debate tonight, and rightfully so because it seems that for the Minister, who is at the table, principles are principles only when they suit him and his political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority of Australia’s aid will continue to be directed to Papua New Guinea for which we have a special responsibility which will not cease when it attains <span class="highlight">independence</span> on 1 December 1974. lt is anticipated that our aid to Papua New Guinea will be at least $500m over the next 3 years and this must absorb much of our attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s announcement only a week or so ago that the Government has undertaken to provide for Papua New Guinea, which is about to become independent, a sum of approximately $A500m over the next 3 years indicates one of the ways by which bilateral aid can give to a country - in this instance one so close to Australia - a feeling of economic confidence which I am sure was material in Papua New Guinea being able to set a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if we had been ideologically attracted to capitalism, in our circumstances this would not be compatible with the kind of development necessary in Tanzania, or with our national <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our first aim is the defence and extension of our <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one sets up a separate agency one likes to think that that agency will have an <span class="highlight">independence</span>, an objectivity and a capacity to report to the Parliament and to express its views on the new dimension in aid policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since they gained <span class="highlight">independence</span> the Indonesian people have endured nearly all the problems and setbacks associated with developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The development of tourism in certain areas also could be of real benefit to Aboriginal Australians by creating worthwhile employment opportunities and thereby greater economic <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The mandate of the Committee of 24 (properly called-, the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Colonial Countries and Peoples) as stated in UNGA Resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 extends only to assisting the movement for <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Trust and Non.SelfGoverning Territories or other territories which have not yet attained <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out by the Minister in his second reading speech that, without amendment, during the period between selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment, during the period between selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment during the period between selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, Papua New Guinea boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My argument with this Government is not at the root of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and transfer of power - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment, during the period between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I wanted to develop the case that this procrastination will find its way into the councils of the United Nations after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly in the earlier days of <span class="highlight">independence</span> Papua New Guinea will have difficulty finding the research funds which will be necessary to determine all that needs to be known about its fishing grounds, the types of fish available, their habits and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of these matters are vital to the wellbeing of the community and critical to the economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase would certainly ensure the position of those hospitals- The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of private hospitals in any possible conflict of religious and medical practice was absolutely guaranteed in the final form of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the very product of the Australian defence effort is to lessen that ability and tragically the result even of this defence re-equipment program is that in the 1980s, our defence forces are to be less efficient and less competent to assert that <span class="highlight">independence</span> than they have ever been before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even there in this supposed assertion of Australian nationalism the very substance of this defence statement denies Australia’s ability to pursue or to implement anything of the defence <span class="highlight">independence</span> that we should be able to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not intended, however, to operate in the areas and to the degree to which Australia’s defence <span class="highlight">independence</span> and defence posture may require it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia will be held to ransom in the international oil market and to that extent its economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be forfeited in consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did Australia vote in support of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2984 (xxvii), on 14 December 1972, which inter alia called for a time-table to be established for the self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister say in the House of Representatives on 17 May 1973, in answer to a question addressed to him by me, that no consideration had been given to <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Cocos Islands and that he did not think anybody seriously considered that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the ongoing function of dealing with constitutional and related aspects of the advancement of Papua New Guinea to <span class="highlight">independence</span> for which the Papua New Guinea Office was set up from 1 December 1973; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer the Honourable Member to the full text of the Prime Minister’s answer to his question about the selfdetermination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands on 17 May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740823_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-73-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not, prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, introduce legislation purporting to regulate off-shore mining in areas beyond the outer limits of the continental shelf within the meaning of the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf nor will it act inconsistently with any international convention relating to the law of the sea to which Australia is a party; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bills I am introducing are a further step in the devolution of authority to Papua New Guinea so that when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes there will not be one aspect of government with which Papua New Guinea will not be familiar and experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They form part of the movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not merely the .sensitive issue of the movement of Papua New Guinea towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> but the sensitive issue of the border between Papua New Guinea and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that the Opposition does not oppose the legislation because it is part of the transition towards self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distinction between self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> is broadly that when an administered area reaches self government it is responsible for all the domestic legislation and control of its own affairs within its own borders at that date, but there are certain powers that devolve and remain existent in the metropolitan or controlling power- the administering authority, if you like- and that is the Government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But some powers were not transferred on the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and we are dealing with one of them now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that we would have heard more of the negotiations between the Government of Australia and the Government of Papua New Guinea in regard to these 2 specific areas of foreign affairs and defence before any likely date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, of course, has been accused by the Constitutional Planning Committee of Papua New Guinea of forcing the pace of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that overall the Government has responded to the wishes of Papua New Guinea, but it seems to me that it would have been wise to settle all areas prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> so that on <span class="highlight">independence</span> the Papua New Guinea Government would not just in fact be governing in all areas but would be doing so at law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned at what will happen when Papua New Guinea achieves <span class="highlight">independence</span>, whether it be April or May of next year or whatever date the Government of Papua New Guinea has in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just wanted to flag the fact that I am concerned that for almost 20 months now I have been standing here asking for information about the defence arrangements between Papua New Guinea and Australia, and I ask for it again in the course of this debate because the Minister himself has said in his own speech that this legislation is part of the movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that we will reach <span class="highlight">independence</span> and we will not know clearly what the role of Australian forces seconded to the Papuan New Guinea defence force will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally, too, am I concerned that we may reach the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> some time next year, with our blessing, at the request of the Government of Papua New Guinea, without resolving the dispute over the border between Papua and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be totally wrong both to deny the constitutional provisions of this country and to seek to act unilaterally, to find that you are bashing your head against a brick wall because the State Government of Queensland is vested with the right of an exercise of power in this area and to do little or nothing about this matter so soon before <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have warned previously in this Parliament that it is one of those issues that I feel, after <span class="highlight">independence</span>, will be raised within the United Nations if the Commonwealth Government has not acted fairly in consultation with the Government of Queensland and the Government of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other delicate matter is the actual transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of both sides of the House have spoken of the gradual movement towards self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope that this is so, but the transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span> is at a delicate stage and it is a stage where we should be ensuring that the utmost assistance is forthcoming when it is requested from Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it appears that this is, as the Minister has said, a further step on the way towards self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said and the Minister himself said in his second reading speech that this is all part of the process of gradual <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were in government we hoped that there would be a gradual move towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>, gradual in the sense that - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that we had hoped that the process of <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be gradual- not gradual in the sense that it necessarily would be slow but that it would be smooth and not a sudden break from one status and set of reponsibilities to another, which are words that will be familiar to some in this House- so that when Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> came it would signify the last step in a long process that had been taken and that a whole series of changes would not be occurring overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had hoped that if we had had our way the gradual movement and actual movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> would contribute greatly to the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> period by establishing a government that was practised in governing and a government that could call on the resources, human and otherwise, that are a necessary part of an orderly and developing nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to those caveats and those questions that I have raised this evening- hopefully they will be answered- we do not oppose the legislation as it is part of the transition towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> which has our blessing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member also got on to his favourite hobby horse in regard to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is curious that we are being attacked for pushing the pace of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each time the honourable member rises he is pushing us faster and faster into the negotiations for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We are talking about the transfer of powers and the movement of Papua New Guinea to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With reference to the second part of the amendment of the honourable member for New England I think it was the desire of the farmers themselves to have some commitment to the industry, apart from government commitment, to give them more <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is designed to preserve the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of our Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is remembered by the people of his electorate for his <span class="highlight">independence</span> of spirit, his devotion to their welfare and the great kindliness and friendliness with which he performed his duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent careful management of their affairs during their working lives has enabled then to provide personally for that retirement and, thereby, avoid claims for Government support, they have achieved a measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> that many others have not deemed it important to achieve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it was not intended that the Budget should penalise those aged and older people, and people approaching retirement, for whom the only means of minimising the effects of inflation now and in the future, and of meeting costs occasioned by the inevitable decline of faculties and capacity for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, lie in maximising the earning capacity of their assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very robust and old-fashioned view regarding the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of universities, and I hope he will long be spared to maintain that view, be it on the Government side of this chamber or in the near future on the Opposition side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>External authorities are exercising more and more authority over higher education, and institutional <span class="highlight">independence</span> has been declining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government for overseas borrowings by the Papua New Guinea Government in foreign currencies not exceeding the equivalent of $20m prior to achievement of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that arrangements for the borrowings for which this Bill provides contractual guarantees will be concluded prior to the achievement of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such assistance is usually eschewed by farmer organisations so as to preserve their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and avoid any suggestion of governmental influence on their attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will not let his <span class="highlight">independence</span> be whittled away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Retention of eligibility for repatriation benefits which are available only to residents in Australia and its Territories will be proposed in respect of Australian veterans and their dependants who are resident in Papua New Guinea prior to that country gaining <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and who continue to reside there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to allow persons resident in Papua New Guinea prior to that country  gaining  its <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, and who continue to reside there after <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, to be then considered still resident in Australia or its Territories for repatriation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Papua New Guinea Loans Guarantee Bill 1974 seeks parliamentary approval for the provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government for overseas, foreign currency borrowings of the Papua New Guinea Government, made prior to the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1974-1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties fully support the Government in the passage of this enabling legislation, which we view to be of particularly high priority, given the imminence of Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the party system of election robs the Chair of the atmosphere of impartiality and <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is so eminently desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister should be devoting much more attention to the area of co-operative housing which can provide a very attractive and less financially burdensome way for young people to attain some <span class="highlight">independence</span> without committing themselves to some of the burdens of the traditional suburban home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, such persons residing in Papua New Guinea immediately before <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be deemed to be resident in Australia for repatriation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that during his speech he referred, among other things, to the ‘inalienable rights of all people to freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should tell that to the Latvians; he should tell that to the Lithuanians; he might also tell it to the Estonians, whose aspirations for <span class="highlight">independence</span> the Government has denied with the stroke of a pen when recognising the incorporation of those states into the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same Government is the first one to stand up and say that it stands for the rights of the individual, that it is a government which believes that all nations must base their policies on the principle of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and that it is a government which says that all nations must be free and equal; yet when one man had the courage to come forward and ask for its help the Government turned him away at the door. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 main parties- the Democratic Union and the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor- have <span class="highlight">independence</span> as their objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of these parties, however, favours an interim period of some form of association with Portugal while the second, which is more radical in its outlook, favours full <span class="highlight">independence</span> after a minimum period of decolonisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it is indeed rare in recent political history for a territory which has existed in virtual isolation for so long to deny itself the prospects of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the prizes of office in favour of a more or less anonymous existence as part of another state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are traditional supporters of the principle of selfdetermination, as set out again today by the Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison),  who is at the table, and the right of nations, even small nations, to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that program he aimed to provide for as much self respect, personal dignity and sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for these people as could be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in total agreement with him that the home environment is undoubtedly the ideal one, but with so many families now in small homes and so many parents working it is not feasible for a large number of elderly people to live with their relatives, and therefore we desperately need homes for the aged where they can retain <span class="highlight">independence</span> and nursing homes for those who are no longer able to care for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It sounds perhaps a small thing but it will give a tremendous feeling of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to handicapped people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what really concerns me and creates an area of potential threat to Australia is the announcement by this Government that all of our defence forces will be withdrawn from Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When a country has self-government and is approaching <span class="highlight">independence</span> it is very difficult to spell out in precise terms some of the things that can be negotiated only at the time of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Grants Commission provides a form of assistance by way of untied nondirected grants to local government, which is a financial topping up exercise to add further finance to local government’s coffers as long as they demonstrate a fair degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and of striving to get their own finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Senate Opposition sought the deletion of the Minister’s general power of direction, ostensibly for the noble purpose of ensuring the complete and absolute <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Broadcasting Commission has <span class="highlight">independence</span> which has been confirmed and guaranteed by the Government, but such independance is to be taken away from the private sector of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was Talleyrand, a diplomat, if I may term him in that way, of another nation and of another day who said that no nation had the right to traffic in the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of small nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that this might be an appropriate way of giving the Institute its own <span class="highlight">independence</span> so that it can provide a proper atmosphere in which research workers can work to the benefit of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not one word has been given to the Parliament about the date for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, about what is transpiring in Papua New Guinea, about the continued transfer of administrative and legislative functions from Australia to that country, or about the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that that country will achieve <span class="highlight">independence</span> next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ought to be ensuring that the relations between the 2 countries are well worked out before <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That special relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea, which we hope will continue in the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> scene, is not being guaranteed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was discussing the lack of information that had flowed from the Australian Government in relation to post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia and other factors leading up to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government, in the United Nations in December 1972, shortly after assuming office, voted for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in 1973 the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  indicated that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would not be granted to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also knows very well that discussions are continuing with the Papua New Guinea Government on the arrangements for devolution of powers arrangements for <span class="highlight">independence</span> at a time which both Australia and Papua New Guinea decide upon and also for post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one cure for this problem in the short term and that is for the Government to make a strenuous effort to make available some finance, but not in the nature of a grant The industry does not ask for it It has been proud of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> it has demonstrated over the years but in this situation where it has fallen victim to circumstances far beyond its control it has a moral entitlement to look to the Government to provide financial means to bridge this period of disaster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In summary, the policies of the Australian Government in respect of Aboriginal people might be described as seeking: to encourage and strengthen the capacity of Aboriginals to manage their own affairs and to increase their economic <span class="highlight">independence</span>; to enable Aboriginals to have a real freedom of choice about their life style and the extent to which, particularly in the more remote communities, they maintain their traditional customs and culture- a freedom which can be exercised to the extent that communities have local authority, in particular through land ownership; to make equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians by working to overcome those handicaps which generally face them in fields such as housing, health, education, employment and civil liberties; in doing this, to help Aboriginals themselves to provide services designed to overcome handicapsfor instance through Aboriginal housing societies, medical services and legal services; and to act in the closest consultation with Aboriginal communities and individuals at both the national and the local levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although those schools are now being totally financed- some would argue that this ought to happen in regard to all non-government schools- their <span class="highlight">independence</span> is in no way infringed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in line with Australia’s policy of ensuring that Papua New Guinea exercises final responsibility in all matters of government before assuming full <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also in line with a recent statement by the Opposition spokesman on Papua New Guinea matters, the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  who argued that it would be wise ‘To settle all areas prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> so that on <span class="highlight">independence</span> the Papua New Guinea Government would not just be governing in all areas but would be doing so at law.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of responsibility by the Government of Papua New Guinea in the areas of defence and foreign relations until formal <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be subject to Australia’s treaty obligations and responsibilities in international law and to the United Nations under the Charter and the Trusteeship Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, Australian policy is to enable Papua New Guinea to exercise authority in all matters of government before the formal step to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and these amendments are designed to give effect to this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be more becoming the stature of a commission of this nature to have its <span class="highlight">independence</span> put in a position where it can, on its own judgment, respond to a request from the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I do not believe that the present Labor leaders could ever free themselves completely from the myths of their own creation, certainly not sufficiently to make policies based on a real understanding of the value of manufacturing industry to Australia in terms of technology, <span class="highlight">independence</span> of spirit and initiative, or its contribution to our standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever reservations we may have about methods employed in asserting those rights to self-determination and a recognised place in their original homeland- there is clearly a new and vigorous spirit, a new sense of destiny among the leaders of the displaced Arabs, a new confidence in their rights to selfdetermination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> within a Palestine state of their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It accords also with the Australian Government’s attachment to the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> if this is what they desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, my Government is also firmly attached to a second principle- that of respect for the sovereignty and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of states and the duty of all states to do nothing to threaten or undermine the right of any other state to exist and to enter into normal and peaceful relations with its neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which it will rely on State environment authorities will depend on the confidence it has in those authorities, on its judgment of their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and on the significance of the proposals from the national viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  say that commissioners will be appointed for fixed terms, taking away the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that they ought to have, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that has traditionally been part of this kind of operation so that governments could not lean on individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We commend the provisions dealing with the lower courts, the House of Assembly, electoral matters and trie repeal of appeals to the High Court of Australia, just as we commend the smooth and early transition of Papua New Guinea to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case, I should have thought that, if not the Minister for Science, at least the man who ran away from the responsibility of answering for both the administration of defence services in Papua New Guinea and more importantly the arrangements between Australia and Papua New Guinea in a postindependence scene ought to have been prepared to tell us in this Parliament what the arrangements will be either after this Bill is passed and in due course is proclaimed or after <span class="highlight">independence</span> what the relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea will be in the defence sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The watershed in relations between the 2 countries will occur at <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present it appears to me that we are prejudging the manner of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by placing a resolution before the General Assembly of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At <span class="highlight">independence</span> Australia’s United Nations obligations will be discharged and a new set of relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea will need to be developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the situation going to be in the postindependence scene? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the postindependence relations in a wide variety of fields to be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Parliament has been largely ignored- I was nearly going to say misinformed- in regard to this important sphere in a post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I was the Minister for External Territories the Government of which I was a member agreed that we would discuss well before <span class="highlight">independence</span> what the relations after <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be, on the very axiomatic point that this takes some time to develop, that it would not be in Australia’s national interest or indeed in Papua New Guinea’s interest to wait until the date is reached and then look at one another, as it were, and determine how we are going to go about things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wanted certainty and order not merely in the transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span> but certainly in the relations in the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Minister when he comes round to replying in this debate will inject some certainty for those who are concerned about post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relations between Papua New Guinea and will advise us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important because after this piece of legislation apart from, as I understand it, certain Australian defence legislation that applies equally to Papua New Guinea and will have to be eradicated so that it applies only to Australia, there will be an <span class="highlight">independence</span> Bill and the final obliteration of the remnants of the Papua New Guinea Act which is being amended by this Bill, and little else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that if we examine the relationship between metropolitan powers and administered entities- whether it be with African countries, whether it be Fiji and the United Kingdom or what other entity one chooses- we would see that there has probably not been an administered area which was as close to the metropolitan power, not geographically but in the way it moved towards its <span class="highlight">independence</span>- as Papua New Guinea used to be to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more important is the fact that I was mentioning earlier about post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it seems to me that we have to keep an eye on relations after <span class="highlight">independence</span> now as much as we do in the smooth and orderly transfer of functions to the independent State itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>requests the administering power to notify the Secretary-General of the date on which Papua New Guinea will accede to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and on which the Trusteeship Agreement shall cease to be in force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian servicemen integrated in the force will be reduced to a figure of about 430 by the end of December next year, months after the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> proferred by the Chief Minister of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will still have responsibility until the esteemed Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  writes his note to the Secretary-General of the United Nations telling him that <span class="highlight">independence</span> has occurred and that we are no longer responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government introduces legislation providing for the areas of defence and foreign affairs to be withdrawn from the Papua New Guinea Act in order that Papua New Guinea can rightly introduce its own legislation- I understand that it has a defence Bill before the House of Assembly now- the Minister ought to tell us what the Government is doing about foreign relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea, not only in the lead up to <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also in the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> period when these matters will be beyond our control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that the arrangements between the 2 countries should be such that there is no uncertainty between us when we reach <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many problems are associated with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe we in this Parliament must give more attention than we are giving at the moment to this post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that we can abdicate our responsibility merely by saying: ‘They have their <span class="highlight">independence</span>; it is their responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the 2 measures we are debating may merely be machinery matters, I think that they emphasise that not sufficient attention has been given by the Government to many of the problems that will be associated with Papua New Guinea obtaining <span class="highlight">independence</span> and going into the future as an independent nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to follow on from the point of order that I made to elaborate a little on the thinking of this Government and also of the Government of Papua New Guinea and the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea in relation to the movement from self-government to <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is:  … the period between self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, was one that the western powers would not have inflicted upon their territories if they had experienced it themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who argue that there should be a long gap between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> are more than anything else mis-informed about the essential character of each concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Self-government means <span class="highlight">independence</span> of action on all domestic matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will have deduced from what I have said that the Australian Government does not favour a long interval between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are dealing with here is not a question of pressure; it is a very sensitive stage of the development of one country into nationhood and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that Papua New Guinea will be moving towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> certainly before the end of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is anyone in this House prepared to stand up and say that if the Houses came into line again as a result of an election for the House of Representatives between 1 July next and 1 July 1976 this would be a blow to the Senate, would create a situation in which the Senate’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be destroyed or would prevent the Senate from functioning properly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister would acknowledge that this is an unsatisfactory way to seek to assert national <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to seek to encourage an acceptance of national institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It seems to me quite paradoxial indeed that the Prime Minister and members of the Governmentwho have asserted their <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the United Kingdom, who have suggested that in some way we on this side of the House were acting against the best interests of the Australian community in maintaining defence ties and close and meaningful ties in so many other forms with the United Kingdom and with other countries of the Western world, and who have denied the right and the meaningfulness of those associationsshould introduce into this Parliament and seek our approval of a piece of legislation which is so reminiscent of the days of the complete colonial subservience of this country to the Government of Westminster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So much for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which he seeks from courts outside Australia; so much for his severing of the old ties of the Commonwealth; and so much for his assertion that really he is not severing his connections with the United Kingdom but is re-establishing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet how little it seems to  fit  with the assertion of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which the Prime Minister has stated is necessary in his reference to us of this Privy Council Appeals Abolition Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it rather strange, indeed irreconcilable, that we should on the one hand accept the jurisdiction of the International Court and on the other hand say to the States which are fighting hard to preserve their <span class="highlight">independence</span>: ‘You cannot have the ultimate  right  Of appeal to the Privy Council.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those  3  reasons- the fact that the States have a right and responsibility to maintain their <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the maximum; the degree to which this Bill seeks through reference to the Statute of Westminster and not by the forms provided in the Constitution to change the Constitution itself; and the fact that the Prime Minister only the other day stated that Australia accepts without reservation the judgments of the International Court- this Bill should be totally rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The AIDC needs to have that degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> so as to make its own decisions free of what would be called political and other influences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regret that the Australian Film Commission does not have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that we in the Opposition believe a statutory corporation ought to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition, throughout debate in the Senate and in the House has maintained that a statutory authority such as the Film Commission should enjoy much greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> from ministerial direction and approvals than the Government has in fact allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There also is a close relationship between this question and the degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which these committees must be given under their democratically elected chairmen because, as with any large organisation of this nature, we are running a real risk of the octopus syndrome- the heart hes in the middle, the tentacles go out in all directions to the various areas of the arts, but ultimately they are all directed back towards the centre and the administrative section of the centre grows and grows in accordance with the best Parkinsonian principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it there are 2 major parties, Fretilin and the UDT, which is the Democratic Union of Timor, which have come together and formed a common program for <span class="highlight">independence</span> which, in effect, brings the political forces with a following suggested to be as high as 95 per cent of politically concerned Timorese under one leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Indonesian attitude to the colony at that stage was said to be that <span class="highlight">independence</span> for east Timor was not a practical option. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the gentleman from the Austraiian Broadcasting Commission-  to say whether Australia accepted the Indonesian argument that <span class="highlight">independence</span> was not a practical solution, the Minister replied that this was a matter for the people themselves to decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One answer may be that the wife’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> lasts only until she becomes a mother, for then she usually loses the ability to fend for herself, except at her children’s expense, and becomes again dependent on her husband and in need of protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750228_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the girl interviewing him quizzed him about his mock indignation about the scheme and asked what is his objection he said that if the doctors carried out bulk billing and were paid by Medibank directly they would be de facto Commonwealth employees; there would be creeping socialism and the doctors would lose their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because there happens to be direct billing instead of going via the back door as it is now- the Government contribution is 50 per centthrough the private funds, because the private part has been eliminated from the scheme and the scheme is to be funded completely by the Government the doctors say that they are de facto Commonwealth employees, their <span class="highlight">independence</span> is taken away, that the British health scheme is upon us with all the inherent problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when those simple agrarian reformers divided themselves into the Communist Party and the true nationalists the divisions in Vietnam began, and what was merely a war against the French became also a war within Vietnam between those who wanted a true <span class="highlight">independence</span> and those who wanted a Communist subjection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With increased Government aid for nongovernment schools- something which we are still waiting to see- a changed relationship between the 2 educational sectors should result and they would probably be drawn closer together and this would be based, hopefully, on the greater interdependence of government schools and not on the loss of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of nongovernment schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750415_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the more important exceptions is a form of double tax relief to apply after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to retain this system in Australia after <span class="highlight">independence</span> but, as the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  announced recently, the salary or wages of Australians working in Papua New Guinea will be exempted from Australian tax where Papua New Guinea taxes the income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose however to continue it in Papua New Guinea’s case after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill generally requires the changes I have described to be synchronised with Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also contains some other measures related to Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750522_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable members for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  and Bennelong  (Mr Howard),  who spoke for the Opposition on the Bill earlier this year, claimed that they opposed it because simultaneous elections would disturb the relationship between the 2 Houses, damage the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and alter its role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate was not founded on elections being held for the 2 Houses at different times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the rights and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate will in no way be abrogated by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commissions, with their <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Public Service Board, will be empowered to perform within their services various functions many of which are now the responsibility of the Public Service Board in relation to the PostmasterGeneral’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who fill the positions will need to be professional people of great dedication and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the Commission should have the right to employ its own staff and be completely independent in a real sense so that it can give objective and dispassionate views and advice to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750527_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that to create 2 powerful, monopolistic authorities with a large degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Government control necessitates the fixing in far more definite terms of the objectives which the Commissions should be seeking to attain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>OTC failed to appreciate the policies of the present Government and the former Liberal-Country Party Government that Papua New Guinea should enjoy a special relationship in line with its promised <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a relationship of considerable <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister says that it will in no way damage the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate nor will it alter the Senate’s present role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Continued <span class="highlight">independence</span> by retention of the Overseas Telecommunications Act is essential if the Government’s professed intention of ensuring that the capability built up by OTC is not destroyed is to have any meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Income Tax Assessment Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to permit Papua New Guinea to be treated for tax purposes as a separate country on its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I take this opportunity to place on record the Opposition’s view that it would be desirable for the Government to have as an objective the negotiation of a comprehensive double taxation agreement with the post- <span class="highlight">independence</span> Government of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is concerned, first of aU, with Papua New Guinea and sets in legislative form the taxation arrangements which are to apply as Papua New Guinea moves towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parts of this Bill which I particularly wish to discuss are not those which are ostensibly the purpose for the Bill, namely, those alterations which become necessary to our taxation law because of Papua New Guinea’s projected <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it is true that specifically the ombudsman has no power to change a decision, the mere fact that one man, given the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the statutory protection of a special Act of Parliament, will be given power to go behind the exterior of government to investigate complaints and to talk to Ministers and to departmental heads, indicates that he will be a very significant person in the Administrative processes of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It expressly requires that the Office should be conducted so as to ensure that its activities do not prejudice the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the legal profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission has been established as a separate body from the Office on the view that the function of research and policy advising is quite distinct from the function of providing legal aid; that only a separate advisory body can give independent and objective advice to the Australian Government upon the roles of respective services and Federal grants to them; that the advisory body would be m a conflict of interest situation if it also administered the Australian Legal Aid Office; and that the wide role of the Commission as adviser to State governments and other bodies and as a body endeavouring to coordinate legal aid schemes throughout Australia requires demonstrable <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Precise details remain to be worked out but, so far as this is practicable and consistent with the foregoing comments, efforts will be made to avoid unnecessary adminstrative costs or undue interference in the execution of the projects in question lest this tend to undermine the voluntary character and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the private organisations undertaking them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750605_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-75-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to emphasise the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, which many people in Australia would emphasise, is this a reasonable way in which we should do it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is argued that we should have the High Court as the final court of appeal to establish law because of our independent status, is there anybody in this House who would support the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  and the Government by saying that the way in which to do it is to establish our lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span>; to establish clearly by an act of this House and the Senate that we do not have the full constitutional <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am not prepared to participate in any way in a method which emphasises the dependence of Australia instead of its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and creates a precedent for further request and consent legislation which can seriously imperil the constitutional status of the 6 constituent members of our federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we will have if we achieve this by referendum is a determination according to the Constitution and not by reverting to some anachronistic procedure which is fraught with peril and which stands as a direct threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the constituent States which make up the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How colonial can you possibly get to resort to a statute the very purpose of which was to emphasise the legal <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the then dominion countries of the British Commonwealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750819_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is driven back to this thought: If we have the right Ombudsman- we will certainly try hard to have the right person in that position- we have to give him a great degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should never be forgotten that in making our own former colony independent, we as Australians enhance our own <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The legislation includes 4 Bills which are associated in various ways with Papua New Guinea’s move to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the islands to be brought within the territorial scope of Papua New Guinea, so that at <span class="highlight">independence</span> that country will exercise full sovereignty over the islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Papua New Guinea Loans Guarantee Bill 1975 seeks the approval of Parliament to the continuation of the Australian Government guarantee, provided for in section 75a of the Papua New Guinea Act 1949-1975, in respect of loans raised by the Papua New Guinea Government from Australian and PNG sources prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> until such time as the loans in question have matured and been repaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But to confine the limits of assistance to that which Austrafia alone shall give would be to confine the limits of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By these Bills we intend to give Papua New Guinea genuine <span class="highlight">independence</span>- not a phoney <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) The Australian Government is working with the Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay to help it to overcome handicaps facing it, and to develop its capacity to manage its own affairs and increase its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750820_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-54-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no national obligations or interest in getting rein.volved in colonial or post-colonial affairs in Portuguese Timor at the very time when Papua New Guinea’s imminent <span class="highlight">independence</span> is leading to the ending of our colonial role there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all the brave words about initiatives, after all the brave words about <span class="highlight">independence</span>, when an ugly and dangerous situation erupts on our own doorstep this Government can do no more than courageously and independently wash its hands of the whole question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our policy is tangible evidence of our longterm objective to return a greater degree of choice and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to individuals and to families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To the extent that it increasingly intrudes into Australian households it will derogate from the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of those households. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous to say that it is, in some way, terribly good for private enterprise and for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the head of the household to spend money by paying it to medical benefits funds but if it goes into taxation to pay for Medibank there is something terrible about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reality is that the first really effective steps towards self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> were taken in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the steps taken by the right honourable member for Higgins ought to be seen in the proper perspective of the proper hastening of moves in a smooth and orderly manner towards self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I can say that my speeches throughout 1972 constantly reiterated the positive goal of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount of development that occurred was tremendous and it was brought about in a manner that permitted us to discuss in a proper and detached manner the move towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are few, if any, examples of administered areas moving towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> which have reached the stage of <span class="highlight">independence</span> on such close terms with the administering authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But taken overall, the resultant transfer towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> is, in my view, something of which Australian governments can be proud and not something to be sneered at on this historic occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the possible exception of the relationship between Britain and Fiji- I do not think even that is pertinent to this case- I would think that there are no other countries in the world that can say that they were on such close terms, following such earnest preparedness for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, as Australia as the administering authority and Papua New Guinea as the territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I should like to quote from one paragraph of that speech to underline further not merely the concern that we had that there should be Australian attention to the move towards self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> but that as far back as 1972 I was aware that there ought to be proper and adequate planning for the post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> BUI basically repeals the Papua New Guinea Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the Papua New Guinea Loans Guarantee Bill provides the guarantees for loans entered into by Papua New Guinea prior to the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>- guarantees from the Aus.tralian Government until the maturity of such loans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the constitutional process toward <span class="highlight">independence</span> I have stressed that both the move to self government, which was agreed during our period in government, and this last step to <span class="highlight">independence</span> were primarily motivated by decisions of the political leadership of Papua New Guinea and responded to by ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have constantly reiterated in this House that there ought to have been more planning of those post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relations, that the move to <span class="highlight">independence</span> ought not to have been a sudden break, that we should not have reached the date when suddenly both governments look at one another and say ‘How are we to relate with one another’, and that there should at least have been more evidence of the planning of this post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relationship between <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that in many instances it may be wise not to enter into a formal arrangement regarding those post-<span class="highlight">independence</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be wiser to wait until Papua New Guinea is independent and executes her agreement to those relations or to whatever formal arrangements are to be entered into as an independent country so that there can be no accusation that she was coerced into those agreements before <span class="highlight">independence</span> was reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have hoped that the long term aid arrangements would also have been determined prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In law they are providing legislation in this House today for that <span class="highlight">independence</span>; so in law it may be so but in fact it was a movement established and planned by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without Australian public servants and members of the Administration in Papua New Guinea and without the ability particularly of the Papua New Guinea leadership- the Papua New Guinea people supporting that leadership- we would not be viewing the satisfactory solution in this movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> that we are today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all my reservations about the lack of preparedness for the post <span class="highlight">independence</span> relations I wish nevertheless to conclude with congratulations to the Government of Papua New Guinea for the way in which it has received the powers that have been transferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For those with a sense of history the Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Bill, is an historic event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Bill simply states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the expiration of the day preceding <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Day, Australia ceases to have any sovereignty, sovereign rights or rights of administration in respect of or appertaining to the whole or any part of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that this is one of the occasions on which those of us who have been associated with the movement of Papua New Guinea through self-government and on to <span class="highlight">independence</span> may reflect on the things that have happened to us in our administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will recall that our discussions were held in the context of assurances which I had given on several occasions during 1973 as to the continuance of Australian aid to Papua New Guinea in the period after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At our talks you referred to the importance of these assurances to Papua New Guinea in the early years after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to confirm that from <span class="highlight">independence</span> a united Papua New Guinea will continue to have first call on Australia’s expanding external aid program in future and, in particular, that Papua New Guinea can count on continuing to receive substantial amounts of aid from Australia over the next three years to underpin its new Improvement Program and to assist Papua New Guinea in the early years after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the imminence of <span class="highlight">independence</span> I am writing now, on behalf of the Australian Government, to inform you that on the basis of present indications a united Papua New Guinea can proceed on the assumption that Australia will provide a total of at least $500m of expenditure on economic and social aid in one form or another over the three year period commencing in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that I can say on behalf of both the Government and Opposition that we thank them for their contribution to the vitality and viability of a Papua New Guinea entering into <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has done a great deal for Papua New Guinea in the short time available to bring it to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Australia’s grant includes $49m for the employment security scheme for expatriate Australian public servants who are losing their jobs because of Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>, it is even less than it appears. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the governments of Australia, both present and past, for what has been achieved in bringing Papua New Guinea to nationhood and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a major factor in the peaceful transition to self-government and then to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall very vividly living and working in Papua New Guinea in 1965 when the then  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  went to a seminar at Goroka and was highly provocative as far as the people of Papua New Guinea were concerned when he said that he would be shocked if Papua New Guinea did not have <span class="highlight">independence</span> by 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the prime motivation for expediting the program for self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> rather than any thoughts of the welfare of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The destiny of Papua and New Guinea is to become a selfgoverning country developed for <span class="highlight">independence</span> if and when it is clearly demonstrated by the majority of the indigenous population that this is what they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our responsibility for the welfare of the new nation changes after <span class="highlight">independence</span> on 16 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the eve of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the Government of Michael Somare says it is stung by a sense of betrayal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We totally endorse these measures but we are concerned at the irresponsibility of the Ministers in the present Government at a time when Papua New Guinea is going into <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the very real uncertainty of future events in East Timor, with the Prime Minister washing his hands of all concern for what might happen there and with Papua New Guinea going into <span class="highlight">independence</span> with assertions being made by the Chief Minister about the implications of the cutback in Australian budgetary allocations for what is now the Territory but will shortly not be a territory, then of course, any Australian must be concerned for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly there is a taxation rebate of $540 for every taxpayer whether or not he or she attempts to make a personal effort towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> by life assurance, education, medical benefits and other self-help activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first principle is to provide security and wellbeing for all citizens and to acknowledge the importance of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and dignity of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appeal is to individual selfishness, to individual greed and to individual <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Day for Papua New Guinea is scheduled for 16 September, I feel that it is appropriate to produce to the House some important and relevant information which has been furnished to me by a constituent of mine who is very well qualified to speak of activities and possibilities in our coastal waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that our predecessors were prepared to condone this situation for all those years since the middle 1950s- 1955- when the Menzies Government accepted the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from Great Britain at the time when Singapore was being given <span class="highlight">independence</span> is no reason why we should continue to condone it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister give an assurance that the integrity and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Information Service will not be interfered with in this way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will remember that  Mr Morrison  was pushed out of Science into Defence in June, at the time when there was a massive attack upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the totality of the CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, aided and abetted by the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),that  great empire builder, decided to transfer the minerals research and the solar studies sections out of the CSIRO and into the Public Service, taking away their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, breaking down the strength of the CSIRO which, of course, very much is concerned with its totality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members would know, this book readily became a capitalist declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the remaining shackles of feudalism and helped to launch an economic revolution that has produced far more wealth than man had amassed in all previous history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with the Minister for Defence in offering the Opposition’s warmest congratulations to the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea and also to the people on the achievement of their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the National Country Party of Australia wish Michael Somare as Chief Minister, and members of his Government well in their country’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite these handicaps the Minister for Minerals and Energy feels that we can pursue a pOliCY of total <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to hell with the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition makes clear its belief that it is necessary to restore integrity, dignity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Public Service- an instrument for providing efficient and impartial administration of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that here again we have not advice which is independent and responsible, and I suggest that the attitude of an Attorney-General in a government and before this Parliament has to be one of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prompted to do so for 2 reasons: Firstly, because like you,  Mr Speaker,  I was in Papua New Guinea during the <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebrations and, secondly, because of some of the reporting in the Australian media since the <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebrations which has given in my opinion an unfair picture of the problems facing the Papua New Guinea Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will therefore content myself with presenting my view of the significance of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebrations and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the nature of the problems now being faced by that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the most impressive aspects of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebrations was the fact that there was neither euphoria nor hysteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were no extravagant gestures or speeches; there was merely a calm acceptance of the reality of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must rank as a rare <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebration indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebrations were highly successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wide range of T-shirts and posters proclaim both <span class="highlight">independence</span> and unity with slogans such as ‘Our country’s future is in our hands’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation would, of course, become complicated if a foreign power were to recognise the unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Bougainville. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only are Indonesian pressures being applied to discourage the option of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, but also there are disturbing reports that similar pressures are coming from Malaya and Singapore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an untenable view when, by all accounts, the majority of the politically conscious in East Timor favour <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the ideal is for aged people to live in their own homes for as long as possible and retain their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The biggest allocation, about $ 120m, is for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, an honoured body with a world reputation and one whose strength depends on its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and its totality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs has gone on record about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was this Government that for the first time gave local government <span class="highlight">independence</span> in revenue raising opportunities and decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look in vain in the Liberal Party policy for the same sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span> being given to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once this Bill passes into law the deficiencies of it will be entrenched in the facilities which it sets up to provide legal aid, and much of the duplication, much of the additional costs, much of the lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from bureaucratic control which concerns the Opposition will then be allowed to go on unhindered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been criticism of the lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Legal Aid Office from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implementation of a national program of legal aid should be the responsibility of a Commission established by statute and  enjoying  <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are certainly very concerned, as others are, at the lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ALAO from the Government and also the lack of real power and teeth which has been given to the Legal Aid Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter which is of vital importance is the question of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, which I have already mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the legal profession is dealt a blow, that will deal a blow to this country and to our basic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever one says about lawyers and their fees, say nothing about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the legal profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we bureaucratise legal aid and keep out the legal profession we will find not only will a blow have been struck at the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the profession but also the community will be deprived of the practice and expertise of the profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Government-created bodies from the influence of the Government, its policies and personalities, has been a most consistent theme of the Opposition throughout the Labor Government ‘s term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the setting up of the Offices after much discussion and consultation with the private legal profession, which I have already related, a number of clauses in the BUI relate to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that the Office shall act consistently and without prejudice with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the private legal profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until now I have been talking of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Office and of its procedures for providing assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repudiate the suggestion from some sections of the legal profession that the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, integrity or even the existence, which is what some say, of the private profession is threatened by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for an agreed definition of that boundary was an inevitable consequence of the policy of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there have been differences in judgment about timing between my Government and its predecessors, there has not, I believe, been any difference on the issue that Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">independence</span> had to be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that on numerous occasions I indicated to him that if this matter was not settled prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> it would go beyond this Parliament into the International Court of Justice and to the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members want to talk about maintaining good relations with Papua New Guinea, I just remind them that the reason <span class="highlight">independence</span> was accepted on 16 September, supported earlier by the overwhelming majority of the members of the House of Assembly, was that the present Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, the former Chief Minister, accepted implicitly and frequently the Prime Minister’s constant undertakings to grant increased aid at the time of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister revoked that promise shortly prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> just as he is revoking his knowledge of the background here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Almost every time I have pleaded with both the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee and the Minister for Defence (Mr Morrison)  to have regard to post <span class="highlight">independence</span> relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not tell me that within less than 4 weeks of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that country the Prime Minister can come in here and ascribe aU blame to the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do say is that if the Prime Minister had sought to bring people together, if he had recognised that after <span class="highlight">independence</span> this would be a festering problem, it could have been solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The profession is not altogether content at the proposed <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Legal Aid Commission which will be established under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, directing the legal aid program, would serve to correct and mollify this rivalry, one would hope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The profession’s second concern arises from its apprehension of the impact of the Australian Legal Aid Office upon its <span class="highlight">independence</span> of government influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond all the cant about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the legal profession, beyond all the nit-picking of the carping critics, stands the central fact that for 23 years the Tories opposite turned a blind eye to the legal needs of the disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of the relatively recent <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that position, it is clearly not the right avenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This autonomy and <span class="highlight">independence</span> largely came through an advisory committee that was established to advise the authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill embodies the following fundamental principles: A salaried legal service is a necessary component of a comprehensive legal aid scheme; the service should be staffed by fully qualified lawyers whose professional <span class="highlight">independence</span> is guaranteed; the private legal profession is also a necessary component of an adequate schemethe profession should be involved in the general direction of the Office but should not dominate or control it; the Government should have a general policy role in relation to the Office, but not in any way at all related to individual matters; there should be an independent body, the members of which are drawn from all relevant areas of activity in the field to advise the Government on general policy and on grants of financial assistance- that is the Commission, the investigative body about which the honourable member for Stirling talked; there should be as much community involvement in the work of the Office as possible consistent with the professional responsibilities of its lawyers; and there should be co-operation not competition between the Office and other legal aid schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It begins with the proposition that the Office, employing solicitors and bringing into being a solicitor and client relationship between the solicitor or the lawyer employed in the Office and client, with complete <span class="highlight">independence</span>, should at the same time, consistent with proper democratic principles, I would have thought, be accountable ultimately to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government tables documents relating to interim defence arrangements between Australia and Papua New Guinea it should’ not sweep aside the reality that for  2Vi  years it was warned that upon Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> it ought to have firm arrangements to determine the relationships between the 2 countries and should not wait until after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same way in which Queensland, which got its separation and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1859, had a more democratic constitution than New South Wales, which attained its constitution in 1852, so it was that the Australian Constitution does not precisely enshrine the principle of the exclusive responsibility of the Lower House in the way in which that principle subsequently developed in Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the present assistance to local authorities is in the form of untied general purpose assistance it is difficult to see how the Opposition’s proposals could provide even greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> so far as the opportunity of local government is concerned to allocate funds according to its own priorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like an assurance from the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  that this <span class="highlight">independence</span> so clearly laid down by this House will not be abridged by secret terms and conditions of appointment because the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Director-General of ASIO isperhaps paradoxically- the key to our individual rights and liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason  Sir Robert  Menzies said: ‘It is clearly impossible, and in any event undesirable, for a Minister to exercise in this field the same degree of supervision and authority that he exercises in his own department’, is no doubt in part attributable to the fact that the DirectorGeneral’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> is guaranteed by the Act itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I personally do not see it as a measure which intrudes upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the organisation or which offends in the respect in which the honourable member for Isaacs indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But one thing is essential, and that is that the Government have control of and be responsible for its own Security Organisation because it alone can guarantee what other honourable members and I have referred to as the necessary element, namely, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But above all they made the judgment because they felt that there was that obligation to provide jobs for Australians who wanted to work, who were willing to work, who were not psychologically unprepared to work and who wanted to have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of people able to support themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I stressed that I believed that resolution 242 of the Security Council should be observed- in other words, that there should be termination of all claims, states of belligerency, and respect for sovereignty and territorial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It very properly displayed that <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the present Government which sought, without any rational reason whatsoever, to cut by half the amount that should have been given in accordance with the consumer price index.- The Commission rejected the Government’s proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I intend firmly to defend their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to encourage their growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The AttorneyGeneral is no different from us unless he has information which he can put before the police so that they, of their own initiative and exercising their own <span class="highlight">independence</span>, can make an investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dignity and capacity for self-help of those in need is preserved by government helping them in ways that least impinge on their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The interviewer goes on to proclaim that an Attorney-General needs a special sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and perhaps isolation from his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day before yesterday, in answer to a series of questions, far from snowing <span class="highlight">independence</span> and isolation from his colleagues, he demonstrated beyond doubt that he is prepared to use his high office for the most blatant political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is already a yawning gap in the Attorney-General’s claim to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, isolation from his colleagues, frankness and honesty, judging by his actions, which are those of a very shoddy politician. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to suggest that if the honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Cotter)  chose to declare unilateral <span class="highlight">independence</span>, he could set himself up as a sheik with the wealth that he has in his electorate and could even buy himself a harem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also welcome His Excellency’s statement that the Government’s aim is to encourage the development of an Australia in which the people have maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to achieve their goals in life in ways in which they decide and the recognition that the disadvantaged must be helped in ways which leave them the maximum <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every country with a Marxist <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement must shiver in its boots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I believe the theme of the GovernorGeneral’s address and the Government’s overall philosophical concept was summed up in the statement that the Government’s long term objective was to encourage a development of an Australia in which people have maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to achieve their own goals in life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to resolve this matter I ask the AttorneyGeneral: Will he call for all papers concerning the Commonwealth Police investigation of organisations concerned with the Portuguese East Timor <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman will be aware of the support by Commonwealth Heads of Government over the last 10 years for sanctions against Rhodesia in an effort to bring about <span class="highlight">independence</span> on the basis of majority rule and of their unanimous support at their meeting in Jamaica last May for providing financial assistance to the new government of Mozambique in applying sanctions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I accept that matters may well be referred to the Committee by the responsible Minister or by resolution of the House, I believe such committees ought to have this degree of flexibility and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in choosing some of the subjects that they wish to have before them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Together with the Government’s continuing silence on the future of ethnic radio, its actions constitute an unprecedented threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the integrity of public broadcasting in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Liberal Ministers have long feared and resented the ABC’s political <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to say that the ABC’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A letter was published in this morning’s Press from 10 prominent Australians defending the financial and political <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We stand with the millions of loyal ABC viewers and listeners in every State who value the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, fairness, integrity and efficiency of one of the great public enterprises in Australian life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence does the Leader of the Opposition have that the Government is threatening the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that whatever changes could be made, if any are made, to the organisation and structure of the ABC insofar as I am concerned, the absolute <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC in reporting particularly political events will remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the responsible Minister, I have given no indication at all that there is any desire on the Government’s part to threaten the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, as evidence of our attitude to protect its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, I cite the specific example of recent industrial disputes which the Commission has been undergoing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say in clear terms that the Government’s attitude on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many ways in which one can state quite clearly, as the Minister did, that the Government intends to uphold the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many backdoor ways by which that <span class="highlight">independence</span> can be destroyed, as I will outline further as I speak this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one studies the small print in that statement one sees that it contains an inference that if the Minister is satisfied or if he can convince the public that advertising will not destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC perhaps he will introduce advertising on the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is an overt way of destroying the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the motives of people who today wish to emasculate the ABC and to destroy its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no use the Minister saying that he will not destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC if the introduction of the types of measures I have mentioned means that the ABC will be forced to impose censorship on its own activities for fear of further reaction against it by the Government, by the Minister himself, and particularly by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition went on to talk at some length about the suggested attitudes of the Liberal Party towards the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been in this Parliament for 7 years now and I remember very clearly suggestions being made during my first period here between 1969 and 1972 when we were in government that we intended somehow to interfere with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the then Postmaster-General getting up in this Parliament time after time and defending absolutely the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC was guaranteed by previous LiberalNational Country Party governments and it will be guaranteed by the present Liberal-National Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr EricRobinson)  who spoke previously made it very clear that- I quote him- there is no threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think any evidence can be adduced to suggest that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is under threat at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that if we are to have the value of the ABC in the sphere of television and broadcasting, to retain its <span class="highlight">independence</span> it should be funded from the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Government’s long term objective is ‘to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government; it is the underlying philosophy which the Government made clear in its expressed intention to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to achieve their own goals in life in the way they decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Fretilin is simply not a nationalist body with the support of most East Timorese aimed at East Timorese <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The East Timor moratorium is simply not a spontaneous rising up of concerned Australians anxious to support a genuine <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement in a small nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fretilin declared unilateral <span class="highlight">independence</span> for East Timor, which it calls the Democratic Republic of East Timor, on 28 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the honourable gentleman recall receiving a letter sent to him on 13 February by the representative of the Cyprian community of Melbourne and Victoria, the Pan Hellenic Committee for the Relief and <span class="highlight">Independence</span> of Cyprus and the Federation of Cyprian Communities of Australia, seeking an appointment with him either in Melbourne or in Canberra in order to discuss the invitation to Archbishop Makarios? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my speech in the House I specifically commended  Dr Hackett  for resisting the threats to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, there are two important points to be noted in this: Firstly, it is an interference with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the various education commissions in making recommendations; secondly, it goes much further than that in that the Government is doing it very quietly, in a secretive manner, with very strict instructions to the various commissions that they should not give publicity to the Treasury guidelines- or government guidelines, if one wants to call them that, although they are actually guidelines recommended by Treasury- because it will show that there is governmental interference with the activities of the various commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the very reason for its existence, is under the heaviest attack in its 44-year history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that it is extremely important to the people of Australia that we preserve the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and role of the ABC as they are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be told clearly and unequivocally that the Government disagrees with the view put by  Senator Withers  and that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is fundamental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware that the Chief Executive Officer of the Graziers Association of New South Wales in a note to the newspapers flowing from the speech the Minister made to the Royal Exchange has criticised any attempt to destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My information is that although there is some communist infiltration into Fretilin it is, basically, a strong nationalistic movement comprising people who are determined to gain their <span class="highlight">independence</span> in an ordinary democratic way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very sad that an elected member of this House, representing the independent democratic people of Australia, should deny that same <span class="highlight">independence</span>, that some democratic right, to our neighbours in Portuguese East Timor, which is only 300 miles from Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are not communists; they are nationalist people who want their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and that is what it is all about.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member denies them the right to run their own affairs and the right to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet these are the people whom the honourable member denies the right of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and he had the audacity to support a fascist aggression, with no justificanon whatsoever, against the poor defenceless half-starved people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760325_reps_30_hor98/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally the Government would deeply regret any loss of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in foreign policy which would be a derogation from the fundamental principle of national sovereignty by any country anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under our administration local government need have no fear concerning its own <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the support that may be provided to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our historic plan to reform the federal system by increasing the financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> of State and local government arises out of our deep concern at the growing centralisation of power in the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the private sector of education is genuinely fearful that if the education commissions, particularly the Schools Commission, do not retain their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and authority they will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do an administrative task, thenown <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be suspect and they will have to defend past decisions, past policies and staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the best of the alternatives is charging the Commission with the task of bringing in a table of priorities so that governments, if they deviate from them, can be seen to deviate from them, but the integrity and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the advice of the Commission will not be prejudiced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did so with <span class="highlight">independence</span>, not as a Commonwealth employee instructed in the sense that Laurie Sheers could be instructed by his Minister in Victoria in the directions of the findings that he would make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously, that is the State Education Minister’s charter of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the State Treasurer and all the Education Ministers liked it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They represent a continued hangover from the days when an overobsession with nationalism, a fervent desire for ever-increased <span class="highlight">independence</span> at any cost and a vague distrust of multinationals and foreign capital were allowed to cloud our thinking, almost to the point of over-saturation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with  Mr D.  J.

    <p>It was to return to the States their sacred autonomy, their cherished <span class="highlight">independence</span>, their due sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nature of the discretions available to the Minister administering the Trade Practices Act also emphasises the desirability of the Act being administered by a Minister in one of the great departments of state with a strong tradition of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, such as the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that represents ministerial interference, if that represents a situation where there is a conflict of interest, if that means that in some way I am interfering with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, I think ordinary English words have lost their plain meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760428_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot is said about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that in no way is it an impairment of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the LAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We hear a lot about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and autonomy of statutory commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addressing that letter and in making that statement, the Government in no way detracts from the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760429_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These very same people are strong supporters of the Fretilin and other <span class="highlight">independence</span> fighters who have moved into the mountains to escape the Indonesian invaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cannot accept the proposition that Australia’s relationship with the Indonesian people will be destroyed if we make a moral stand on the rights of the East Timorese people for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the basis of our bond to all Indonesians is our support for them during their own <span class="highlight">independence</span> struggle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only basis for long term relationships in the region is one of honour and integrity, not devious compliance with a situation that has already produced suffering of horrifying proportion and that is likely to lead to further wholesale violence over a protracted period of struggle by the East Timor <span class="highlight">independence</span> forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fretilin, like most other political parties in East Timor except Apodeti and one other small party, has a basic policy of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for East Timor and is opposed to integration with Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The destruction of those people, and their loss of any possibility of <span class="highlight">independence</span> under Indonesia, was a strange policy from a government which was so happy to wax eloquent about other people’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and their right to self-determination, in this chamber and elsewhere including discussion with Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of people in this world cannot read and write but that does not mean they are stupid or they do not understand what <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self-determination are all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760504_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How can his own Ministers and Government members feel confident that their <span class="highlight">independence</span> has not been compromised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is sheer fantasy for the Premier to assert that his claim to <span class="highlight">independence</span> is based on his Loan Council membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Queensland Premier is seriously deluded if he thinks he goes to Canberra to Loan Council meetings, there to enjoy splendid <span class="highlight">independence</span> from his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and impartiality of the Queensland Public Service have been seriously sullied by the behaviour of the Queensland Premier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has degraded the institution of Parliament and the proper principles of Cabinet government, compromised the impartiality and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the State Public Service and brought himself into deserved contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Up until recently one State maintained a significant <span class="highlight">independence</span> in this area, and I do not know whether Victoria still has its own State statist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pride and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of owning one’s car, the thrill of keeping up with the model, and possibly the Jones family, is accepted as part of modern living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This, however, is a consequence of the speed with which events have moved in Papua New Guinea ‘s attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Staffing Assistance Group was devised as a mechanism to provide the Papua New Guinea Government with the professional, technical and high level administrative expertise which it needed, particularly in the period between selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has given it the illusion of greater freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> from its new federal partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly it is aimed at removing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC to plan its programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will create a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the normal Public Service regulations and the dead hand of the Treasury in a business operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for Perth  (Mr McLean)  on his support for Polish democracy and Polish <span class="highlight">independence</span> just as enthusiastically as I condemn the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  for quoting last evening an editorial written by Father Wilkinson, the editor of the Adelaide  Southern Cross. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a massive increase in general purpose funds and reflects this Government’s desire to give local government a real measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility, and to make it a genuine partner in our overall federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> given to schools in this new scheme, a considerable reduction of Regular Army support will be possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that social welfare programs such as the Australian Assistance Plan must be pruned to realistic levels before the Australian people lose their initiative and <span class="highlight">independence</span> altogether and settle for a way of life based on handouts, as they were encouraged to do by our predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This action creates extreme embarrassment and makes the functioning of the Public Service- its impartiality, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and forthrightnessdifficult to maintain if anything but that total confidentiality is to be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask: Is he aware that his action already is causing considerable unease in the Public Service, many members of which feel that their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and distance from political conflict will be difficult to maintain in the light of his action? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The degree to which the new federalist proposals will succeed in providing greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> and greater opportunity for State governments depends largely upon the ability of the Federal Government to contain inflation and upon its success in its overall economic program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>If the Government answered honestly it would publicly say that the real and financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> of local government is a myth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was turning to the tensions and conflicts which have troubled the Indian sub-continent since <span class="highlight">independence</span> and which have come to absorb so much of its energies and to cause it to assume a rather self-absorbed, closed character. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760601_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot accept the proposition that Australia’s relationship with the Indonesian people will be destroyed if we take a moral stand on the rights of the people of East Timor to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and seek the truth about the death of these S young men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that it was our Government that gave great support to the Indonesian people for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They would understand our support for national <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Timorese people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That body, with its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, is free to recruit people with all the necessary expertise and skills, free of the cumbersome mediocrity of the public service system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority was a national body capable of being awed and respected, a body which the States eventually would greatly appreciate as they came to learn the advantages of unity and now a body deprived of its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, back in the bureaucracy where it will be choked and stultified by the whim and fancy of the Minister and financially crippled by his colleague the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760602_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ombudsman and the deputies are given security of tenure in office akin to that accorded to judges, so that there is little likelihood of an ombudsman’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> of operation being influenced by the executive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the proposed timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Cocos Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government has not established a timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760604_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-54-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, let me reiterate that the Labor Party sees as a singularly important role for Australia, assistance towards the economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the countries to the north of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important for the sake of the appearance of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Ombudsman that Parliament be directly associated with both his appointment and his operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is an appearance of <span class="highlight">independence</span> they will believe, I think unfortunately, that they have been subjected to bureaucratic pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Matters such as this throw into question the entire issue of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill seeks to repeal section 32, thus recognising the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea and the fact that there is no Minister for External Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760908_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All are calling for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and for non-alignment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is as if <span class="highlight">independence</span> and non-alignment cannot be run together as if they were the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only can a country maintain its <span class="highlight">independence</span> within an alliance, but an alliance often provides the best guarantee of its continued <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the present Opposition was sincere when it was in office about the establishment of the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission, if it was sincere in its determination to have <span class="highlight">independence</span>, what is wrong with the Commission raising its own funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happened on 17 August 1976 showed that the Fraser Administration was determined not to follow the lead of the Whitlamites of robbing the working man of his financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and his hopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, I repeat what the Prime Minister has said and I have said on a number of occasions, that is, that the integrity and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC are not under threat, that they are not at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The body will be distinctly bipartisan and the Government wishes to make sure that its <span class="highlight">independence</span> is preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>(a) that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Bureau of Statistics should be demonstrated by making it responsible to a Minister other than the Treasurer; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The apparent <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Bureau has been reduced by the Fraser Government’s decision to place it under the Treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One recommendation in chapter 1 1 is that of giving <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Bureau of Statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The assertion that the Treasurer is compromising the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Statistician is not backed by fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the commitment this Government has given makes no assurances on either <span class="highlight">independence</span> or capacity, and in fact the national State consultative committees which were to be the basis of the Government’s approach have not as yet been announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was established as a statutory body to give it the <span class="highlight">independence</span> necessary for this role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time no-one expected <span class="highlight">independence</span> to come about in Papua New Guinea as early as it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One might well question just what were the genuine reactions of people like Michael Somare when that <span class="highlight">independence</span> was almost thrust upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was one thought that he never failed to express and that was that should <span class="highlight">independence</span> come about he would hope that in matters of defence and foreign affairs we would still be considerably involved in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We supported their struggle for national <span class="highlight">independence</span> just as we support the East Timorese in achieving self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1945 I was in Indonesia with the Australian forces and I can remember the appeals on the radio by the people for support for their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In visits to Indonesia in subsequent years one was touched by the gratitude they expressed for the fact that the Australian Government at the time- and it was a Labor government- gave them adequate support in their fight for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am firm in the conviction that while we were in office the pressures that we kept up, inadequate as they were in their total public expression, retained a reasonable <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the people there and kept the Indonesian forces from overt action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having been fortunate enough to have served in the Papua New Guinea Administration for 2 years during the fascinating period immediately prior to self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, I can assure the Committee that our continuing assistance to Papua New Guinea undoubtedly is one of the most significant and useful aspects of our foreign aid program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This dated from the election of the first House of Assembly in 1964, through various stages of increased local responsibility, until the final granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in late 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This systematic approach compares markedly with the performance of some of the colonial powers, who let the local leadership out of gaol shortly before <span class="highlight">independence</span> and then expected them to set up a parliamentary government and all it involves at 9 a.m. on the first day of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting that faith in Papua New Guinea’s future is obviously shared by that nation’s white population as the vast majority of the permanent residents of that section of the population have remained there since self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and seem to be content to remain for the years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ADAA was established by Labor in order to provide development assistance with some degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from considerations of day to day diplomacy and foreign policy decisions, and in order to create an opportunity for public servants concerned about developments to make a career in it rather than leaving aid to be administered in an  ad hoc  manner by diplomats for whom aid was not necessarily their main interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the field of employment and enterprisesother areas subjected to the closest scrutinyadditional funds will be made available to help alleviate the serious employment problems amongst Aboriginals and to support and stimulate realistic Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enterprises which can lead to economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self-reliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  pointed out to the House on 25 August the family allowance scheme involves funds which go directly to Aboriginal families and gives them an <span class="highlight">independence</span> and capacity to spend those funds as they believe best in their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a very big difference between wheeling in a building company with its own architects and laying down streets of houses for Aboriginal people, and allowing Aboriginal people to develop <span class="highlight">independence</span>, autonomy and self-sufficiency by building the houses themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was a deliberate attempt to cut off the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement in East Timor from the outside world and to scuttle the visit of the United Nations representative,  Mr WinspeareGiucciardi,  to East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it is to prevent the United Nations from hearing the voices of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from East Timor and to make it easier for the Prime Minister to recognise the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that Nauru, formerly a Trust Territory administered by Australia for many years, gained its <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament, in the enactment of the Nauru <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Act 1 967, made provision for the final moves of the Nauruan people to the adoption of their own constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of negotiations that preceded the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Nauru, the Nauruan leaders expressed a wish that provision be made for appeals to the High Court from certain judgments of the Supreme Court of Nauru that was to be established under that constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill makes provision for a number of social security programs which give effect to the Government’s desire to assist people to overcome hardship and insecurity in ways which ensure that they retain the maximum scope for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government’s long term objective is to encourage the development of an Australia in which people can have maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> so they can achieve their own goals in life in ways they themselves desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have in this country is a pseudo-federalism- a system which multiplies governments and bureaucracies without promoting the local autonomy and regional <span class="highlight">independence</span> which true federalism is meant to confer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Bjelke Petersen is not the only Premier who is paranoid at the prospect of local government gaining financial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until it is guaranteed reasonable autonomy, reasonable financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and reasonable access to the nation’s financial resources all the Grants Commissions and any advisory councils will achieve nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He failed to tell the House that the manner in which he handed out that money to both the State governments and local governments was designed to take away their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and autonomy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition has sought to gloss over that difference by pretending that he would have in mind giving local government greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> and autonomy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our aim, therefore, is to strengthen the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the State and local governments and to do this they must be given an adequate capacity to act as they believe best and the political responsibility of raising the funds they spend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the State governments gave greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> to local government and that the States raised directly the taxes that they need to carry on their services and enable local government to have the rate base available to it together with other revenue sources to spend directly on the responsibilities that belong to local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are common interests- a common interest in maintaining the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and territorial integrity of both our countries, in advancing the prosperity and the further development of conditions in which our peoples can build a decent life for themselves and in keeping great power competition out of the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following <span class="highlight">independence</span> they believed that the only way to catch up with the West was to compete on the basis of technology and secondary industry, and consequently we are facing even in Australia the problem of a large textile industry in the Philippines, for example, which wishes to export to markets like ours which they believe should be open to their products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is, the appointments to which I have just referred- is the political <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Service which has always been held in the past to be beyond reproach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question now being asked by sections of the Press and by the public is whether the political <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service is being subordinated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditionally of course, for aU sorts of reasons- many of which I think are irrelevant now- we have attempted to create greater areas of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the Public Service, in its appointments and in its administration, because in the past we had the kind of politics where interference created what we might call ‘corruption’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what the Public Service Act has done in the past and still does and what this legislation is doing and amplifying is to give a permanent head a greater area of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly, however, it will help to secure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the federal judiciary, notwithstanding the existence of a procedure for fixing retiring ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This will remain the formal ultimate guarantee for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the federal judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Parliament may look with pleasure and with no little pride upon the fact that in this new era of Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and national sovereignty it has joined with Australia to re-affirm a clear and mutual interest in close co-operation and consultation in defence matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposal to require that no division- I repeat ‘no division’- in a State not having an area of 5000 square kilometres may be smaller than any division which has more than 5000 square kilometres, the larger being deemed large electorates, is, I think, an ill-thought out compromise which creates conditions under which the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Redistribution Commissioners to carry out their job is denied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can then be a sense of complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, with judicial appointments, complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> would seem to have been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The participating States will respect each other’s sovereign equality and individuality as well as all the  rights  inherent in and encompassed by its sovereignty, including in particular the right of every State to juridical equality, to territorial integrity and to freedom and political <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-40-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is our <span class="highlight">independence</span>, our initiative, our capacity for tightening our belts and working our way out of our economic difficulties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some reference was made to the need for change and I am pleased to say <span class="highlight">independence</span> of spirit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such reports are provided, to what extent are they affected by the restriction on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the amalgamated Bureau in comparison with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which was enjoyed by the former Bureau of Roads? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the Bureau of Transport Economics was never a statutory authority, and I do not think any of its reports, all of which have been tabled in this House, have been challenged as to integrity, nor has the volume or the value of the work done by the Bureau of Transport Economics been challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not hold with the view that change will result in terms of <span class="highlight">independence</span> because of the amalgamation of the two bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that nearly all members of what used to be called the British Empire on obtaining <span class="highlight">independence</span> have chosen to remain in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Statute of Westminster is no longer an instrument of Canadian and Australian <span class="highlight">independence</span> but an impediment to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was under Australian auspices that Papua New Guinea was brought to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must get back to a situation, as  Her  Majesty said, in which Australia as a nation depends on creating the conditions which foster the strength, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and creativity of its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am trying to impress upon honourable members is that these traditions indicate the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and freedom of members of the House of Representatives or, in the situation to which I referred, members of the House of Commons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet those same people who talk about <span class="highlight">independence</span> and who want it so much are the people who literally ask: ‘Why did the Crown not intervene?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is not much Australian <span class="highlight">independence</span> shown in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every attempt at <span class="highlight">independence</span> was seen as a communist plot and the more they supported the oppressors and exploiters the more they made certain the self-fulfilling prophecy of communist domination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told then, as we were told about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea, that with the removal of the Australian and other armed men from the area bloodshed and wholehearted slaughter would take place between the people who lived in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that we could not take any steps towards giving Papua New Guinea its <span class="highlight">independence</span>; that we must keep it as one of our colonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It told the Papua New Guinean people that a timetable would be set for them to have their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and the timetable was adhered to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For centuries they were under neo-fascist Portugese rule and, when it looked as though they would gain <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the first time in history, they were dominated by the military junta of Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent months a number of people have said that the people of Rhodesia should be given their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, that they should be given their freedom and that they should be allowed to rule and control the country themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the major question that could be asked in regard to that is: Which group is to be given the <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems will not be solved merely by turning around and saying ‘That is your <span class="highlight">independence</span>, you control everything’, and walk away and leave them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One man said to me once: ‘Yes, but they want their <span class="highlight">independence</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was not much value in <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the thousands of people who had been massacred in both those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder how the relatives of the people whom Idi Amin has massacred feel about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that was given to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Though some of the recommendations we make may temporarily require increased expenditure, the end result will be to bring a return in increased <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Aboriginal communities and individuals within a comparatively short period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The monarch has <span class="highlight">independence</span> and inspiration which would be hard to acquire from any other system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the IAC or any other advisory body such as the Schools Commission is given a departmentlike role- in other words, it is given an executive function- it then will have its own policies of yesterday to protect, it will lose its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and it will not serve the purely evaluative role that it should as a servant of this Parliament rather than of the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s long term objective is to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This day commemorates their <span class="highlight">independence</span> which was achieved on 16 February 1918 when Lithuanian freedom fighters, after the First World War, declared their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> was recognised by all nations including Bolshevik Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Lithuania lasted only 22 years until 1941 when Hitler and Stalin agreed to partition Poland and Lithuania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the other matter, I understand that a question did arise in the Magistrates Court yesterday about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the magistracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened was that some of the magistrates themselves raised questions about the terms of the ordinance and the nature of their own <span class="highlight">independence</span> under the ordinance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any questions relating to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the magistracy will then be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, an Australian government must attempt to maintain a degree of balance in manufacturing industry so that shifts in technology and terms of trade allow Australian industry to take up market opportunities and to maintain a measure of national <span class="highlight">independence</span> through the capacity to supply the defence forces in times of bad international relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is probably more difficult today for a government to be economically responsible than it was in any of the other 77 years of our <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The BTE has no less and no more <span class="highlight">independence</span> in this regard than the Bureau of Roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the BTE’s advice and its Director’s free access to me as Minister are established facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More importantly, neither the integrity nor <span class="highlight">independence</span> of its operation has ever been challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have already said, no one has ever questioned the integrity or the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the BTE. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was an argument which was the basis of our representation over 100 years ago in Australia- in the 1840s and in the 1850s- when we secured a measure of selfgovernment and, of course, the question was behind the great struggle in America for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An illustration of how small-minded we are in the administration of these courts is that we have a situation in Sydney where the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in order to preserve the dignity of his Court and its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, has instructed the chief executive officer of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to lock and to bar a door between the glassed entrances to the Federal courts and the State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Attributes like <span class="highlight">independence</span> from departmental and political influence are important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau of Roads has had its own financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and its own division in the Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I thought that this Bill to repeal the Bureau of Roads and to amalgamate it into a new organisation was going to mean that the professionalism, expertise and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Bureau would be lost to Australia then I would oppose the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the first 2 points are concerned, as I understand it, the main reason for local government requests was to ensure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the new bureau in its research and advisory capacities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is technically not necessary for the new organisations to be effected by legislation in order to obtain this <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister said, neither its integrity nor its <span class="highlight">independence</span> of operation has ever been challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In many cases it has given women in the Australian community a degree of financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> which they never had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For various reasons, no doubt now lost in the various files of the Public Service Board and other places, it was decided to add to the original organisation virtually the entire staff of the then Department of External Territories because nobody knew what to do with them as Papua New Guinea approached <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The low foreign exchange earnings of those nations and the huge foreign debts which they have regrettably had to run up since <span class="highlight">independence</span> will continue to remain a major difficulty in their overall economic welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are now emerging to or have reached <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As they reach <span class="highlight">independence</span> Australia, as the major country in this part of the world, under this Government will most certainly be prepared to accept its full responsibilities in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those who indulged in what I refer to as cant and hypocrisy and wearing flowers and hearts on their sleeves today proclaiming the importance of aid programs would do well to recall that under the aegis of a special relationship with Papua New Guinea, it was Labor that slashed aid programs to that country, and not just in any year but in the very year in which <span class="highlight">independence</span> was to be reached by Papua New Guinea- the most sensitive period of her development towards nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> which its statutory role gave to the Bureau of Roads appears also to have been unwelcome to the proponents of a wider ranging transport research bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have already said, no one has ever questioned the integrity or the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the BTE. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would respectfully request the Minister to ensure a continual and persistent monitoring of the operation of the new Bureau to make certain that its <span class="highlight">independence</span> is maintained and the quality of its advice is not reduced by virtue of its position within the Department of Transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by reiterating that the Bureau of Transport Economics will be of value to this Government and to those who will seek its advice and assistance only if it retains its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be made perfectly clear that we on this side of the House do not oppose the concept of amalgamating the 2 bodies but we are concerned that as a result of the legislation the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and impartiality of the new body will be at serious risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have placed a value on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which flows from being part of a statutory body, set up under its own legislation and reporting directly to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly that <span class="highlight">independence</span>, that zeal, is worth preserving and could easily be preserved if the Government modifies its thinking to effect the amalgamation by separate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the post-war period Premiers of all political persuasions have been adamant that the uniform taxation system would ultimately, in conjunction with the growing use of section 96 grants, destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once this happens the States will lose any <span class="highlight">independence</span> they might have in regard to a separate income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to increase the budgetary <span class="highlight">independence</span>, responsibility and flexibility of the States, it is proposed that as soon as possible each State Government will have discretion to impose a surcharge or allow a rebate on the total personal income tax of that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was also concerned whether the new amalgamated Bureau of Transport Economics would have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which was such an attractive feature of the Bureau of Roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The BTE has no less and no more <span class="highlight">independence</span> in this regard than the Bureau of Roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Bureau of Transport Economics receives administrative support from the Department of Transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the  BTE’s  advice and its Director’s free access to me as Minister are established facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In answer to the honourable member for Melbourne, who had grave apprehensions about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and powers of the proposed organisation, I quoted from the Minister’s second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister left no doubt in anyone’s mind about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the proposed Bureau of Transport Economics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I read the present organisational structure of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Bureau has been absorbed totally into the Department and there is no trace of its old <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been loosely attached to the Department of Transport and seemingly its <span class="highlight">independence</span> has been respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept the Minister’s pledge that he intends to preserve the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the new Bureau of Transport Economics once it is attached to his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be only a matter of time before the Bureau is shorn of its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are important areas of public policy and public spending where a high degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> is needed, and the Bureau of Roads is a prime example of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Council is convinced that the future of road funding in South Australia and in the rest of Australia may well be dependent on having a body of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that is suggested above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the reservations that was expressed to me by local councils was that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of those officers working with the Bureau of Roads should not in any way be impaired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau of Transport Economics, into which the Bureau of Roads is being amalgamated, has no less and no more <span class="highlight">independence</span> in this regard than the Bureau of Roads presently has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But <span class="highlight">independence</span> can create problems, as well as save governments money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The States are finding out that <span class="highlight">independence</span> has only one meaning, that they pick up the tabs for those things for which the Commonwealth decides it does not want to pay or for which it does not support continuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this House censures the honourable members for Hawker and Scullin for participation in subversion of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service by use of material prepared by a public servant for purposes designed to discredit the Government or a member of the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that question, central to our freedom, our <span class="highlight">independence</span> and our national sovereignty, the Prime Minister was silent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It reacted to the plight of displaced persons in Europe immediately after World War II and to the consequences of various events in Eastern Europe, of which the most notable were the Soviet repression of movements towards national <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has played a part in trying to see that the developing countries not only have political <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also are able to achieve economic <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The more we can do to assist by giving tariff preferences to their goods coming into this country, the more quickly they will reach the economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is an integral pan of a proper and lasting political <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government considered the establishment of a body similar to the American Federal Legal Services Corporation to provide legal aid in Australia, as proposed by Attorney-General Enderby, which is both well founded and has <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Government service instead of establishing legal commissions in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-47-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I appreciate the work done by nursing homes and other institutions, it saddens me greatly when I visit nursing homes- we all do as politicians- and am told with tear in eye: ‘I wish I were home and I wish I could get my <span class="highlight">independence</span> back’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s legislation to remove the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Bureau of Roads was further evidence of its designs to downgrade the priority of road planning and road funding in the national accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concommitant with that would have to be a handing over of the very jealously guarded powers of the States concerning their technical education systems so that we can have some local control and some real autonomy and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, financially, philosophically and academically, of the technical and further education sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last item in the resolution concerns leaving untampered the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools and TAFE commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government also must continue to provide direct assistance without impinging upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of such schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know for the life of me why the Government wants the Bureau to be independent unless the Government intends to appoint someone who through his <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be able to continue to follow Liberal Party philosophy after the Liberal Party loses the next election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is, it has no moral right to say that it will give the Bureau complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> so that when the honourable member for Gellibrand becomes the Minister for Labor he will not have the power to direct the Bureau to implement government policy in respect of industrial relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To insist upon giving <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Director of the Bureau is a very serious breach of the agreement and cannot be said to be in conformity with existing processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other important recommendation so far as the Islanders are concerned, I believe, is that the Island should have much more <span class="highlight">independence</span> and that it should have a greater say in its own destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770530_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the activities of the Committee proceed, it is becoming more and more apparent that the final authority on road safety matters, whether it be statutory or otherwise, must have <span class="highlight">independence</span>, must have muscle and must be able to demand the respect and cooperation of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in view of the Commission’s position as the first appellate body above the boards, such oversight could be seen to weaken the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the boards as initial determining bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The object of these provisions is to obtain better co-ordination among boards, to ensure the attainment of a high standard by boards in the discharge of their duties, as suggested by  Mr Justice  Toose, but without reducing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of each board in the exercise of its determining power under the Act in respect of individual cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A Public Service inquiry by senior public servants, irrespective of their association with the case concerned and /or their association with the department concerned, is  still  a Public Service inquiry where the senior officers’ peers are inquiring into their activities and the activities of an extremely junior operative in the field who is arguing for some <span class="highlight">independence</span> of action in the face of direct orders from his superiors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The safeguards involved in Australia ‘s system of representative and responsible government, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary and the procedures adopted by our courts, the freedom of the Press and the possibility of parliamentary or ministerial investigation or other inquiry are important factors in the maintenance of human rights in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But let there be no nonsense about this question of <span class="highlight">independence</span> insofar as the Opposition is concerned because it had its chance in 1975 and the production was a miserable one from the point of view of having an independent commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have dealt with the subject of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and I have dealt with the subject of the amount of funds being provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he made some reference to the fact that the previous legislation was not in accordance with what he would regard as <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In regard to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> being preserved, I take note of the fact that there was to be a board of management which was to be free and unfettered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the board of management certainly would be likely to assert its <span class="highlight">independence</span> because of the professional <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the lawyers who were appointed by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Office is safeguarded in the following ways: The board of management comprises persons who are likely to insist on freedom from improper pressure; its top management consists of lawyers appointed for a fixed term; its lawyers are confirmed in their professional status and are subject to the jurisdiction of courts in relation to their professional conduct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Government is going to run legal aid but restrict it to a Treasury allocation, there is not the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which we seek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We get the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and we get the funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is general agreement that visible and effective <span class="highlight">independence</span> from government at all levels is essential if legal aid services are to guarantee full and effective representation to all citizens whose rights are infringed or whose interests are threatened and if salaried lawyers are to be protected against any suggestion of improper pressure or interference in their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In our view the most satisfactory method of promoting the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Legal Aid Office is to vest the basic responsibility for the formulation of policy affecting the Office in a broadly based Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill establishes a Commission and gives the Commission functions, but it gives no guarantee of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and it certainly gives no guarantee of funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we should guarantee the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, we should guarantee the permanence of the existing structure and, above all, we should guarantee the provision of sufficient funding for all the needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, there are no guarantees in this legislation about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the profession or about the way in which State commissions have to be organised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A further threat to <span class="highlight">independence</span> is created if service in a salaried legal aid office is a stepping-stone to promotion in other departments of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was that in view of the Commission’s positions as the first appellant body above boards, such oversight by the Commission could be seen to weaken the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the board as initial determining bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>President  Makarios represented the new political <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Cyprus; but he also embodied its ancient spiritual <span class="highlight">independence</span>, for when Michael Mouskos, son of a peasant, became Archbishop and thus Ethnarch in 1950, at the age of 37, he assumed the imperial prerogatives which were accorded the head of the Orthodox Church in Cyprus when it was made autocephalous just 1 500 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proper course for the friends of Israel and for the Government of Australiathe Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  has acknowledged that this Government follows the policy established by my Government- is to urge and encourage all the parties towards negotiations based on a mutual recognition of the rights of both Israel and the Palestinian people to their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, their sovereignty and their self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So when we speak of whether Israel should withdraw from the West Bank, from Sinai, or from the Gollan Heights, we should also consider that since the first war of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1 948 this problem has remained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Broad principle has been dispensed with in favour of particular directions to a Schools Commission which could once boast <span class="highlight">independence</span> and needs based allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as I know, it has made none and it probably will not make any, such is its cynical attitude to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Indonesian Government was reminded late last year by several members of the Australian Labor Party when they were in Indonesia and when the Australian trade union movement was being criticised by the heads of the Indonesian Government, that the Australian trade union movement employed similar embargoes and fought just as tenaciously for the Indonesians when they were fighting for <span class="highlight">independence</span> against the more or less harsh Dutch colonialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, does the fact that the Government has now given direct instructions on overall financial guidelines in considerable detail throw a new light on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can say that the Labor Party will continue to oppose these decisions in the strongest possible terms and will seek to maintain the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of schools and university commissions established by the Labor Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he also say whether the United Kingdom legislation provides (a) for the establishment of an Insurance Brokers’ Registration Council which decides whether or not applicants should be registered, (b) that the Council will consist of 17 members, 12 of whom will be nominated by the insurance broking industry and five, one of whom shall be a lawyer and one an accountant, to be nominated by the Government, (c) that the Council will evaluate applicants’ qualifications, experience, their financial backing and their <span class="highlight">independence</span> from insurance underwriters and (d) that the Council will require members to submit to a code of ethical behaviour to be set down and to maintain proper accounting and financial reporting standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission recommended that the efficient and objective performance by the Office of its functions required that it be established under what the Commission called a charter of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister was at great pains in both of his statements- that of 5 May which was made when he tabled  Mr Justice  Hope’s abridged report, and his second reading speech when introducing this Bill- to talk about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Office of National Assessments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Bill certainly embodies the three major principles of creating <span class="highlight">independence</span>, centralising the role of the National Assessments Office and giving it a wider role, particularly in the economic held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps that is commendable <span class="highlight">independence</span> but not, therefore, Labor policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As well the Government has acted in an extremely harsh way to harass the East Timorese <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1974 in the General Assembly a resolution was carried which welcomed Portugal’s acceptance of the principle of self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for its colonial territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It called on Indonesia to withdraw its armed forces from East Timor to enable the people of the Territory freely to exercise their right to self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same way we now support the struggle of the East Timorese to establish their <span class="highlight">independence</span> as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The road to <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the democratic Republic of East Timor will be long and hard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the difference between the life or death of an Indonesian soldier killed in Timor and the rights of a citizen of Timor to fight for his <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond that, and to speak about less tangible but perhaps fundamentally more important aspects, small business fosters a spirit of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and initiative, so important in our liberal, democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as a member of Parliament, whose electorate adjoins the electorate of the honourable member for Canberra, I can say only that his <span class="highlight">independence</span> and his non-party politics in favour of those people whom he represents in this place have been, as was the case when the Territory was represented by the late Jim Fraser, of great benefit to the people of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two things are happening: The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission is being undermined, and the personal prejudices of the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  against the whole concept of the Schools Commission and its basic approach to Australian educational needs, are being imposed on Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real seriousness of this threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission becomes apparent when we consider the present Prime Minister’s long record of unrelenting hostility to the very concept of the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And clearly, the first step is to undermine the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission; destroy that and then it is only another short step to destroying the Commission itself and to destroying the concept of national responsibility for the needs of all our schools, government and non-government alike, on which the Commission is based and on which it acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission stands in the way; therefore its <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission stands in the Prime Minister’s way; therefore he seeks to undermine the Commission’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By undermining the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission the present Prime Minister is acting true to form as the most divisive Prime Minister in modern times- the divider of his party, the divider of his country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission was under some threat a case for bringing forward a matter of public importance could be made and would be a suitable subject for debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this <span class="highlight">independence</span> clearly is not under any threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission was not in any way affected by those guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission depends on its ability to report on those aspects that it sees fit to report on irrespective of whatever other parameters it must take into account in any report that it makes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its <span class="highlight">independence</span> also depends on its ability to put down its version of the best breakups of education funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the guarantee of its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the tests and guarantees of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission, or for that matter of any other advisory commission of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has demonstrated its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Schools Commission has demonstrated its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition makes the point that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission has been affected in all aspects of education but most importantly in what is called financial resource allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, there is this basic problem of the Schools Commission losing its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and virtually fighting for its life because it says - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It is somewhat ironic that the terms of this discussion of matter of public importance refer to the Government ‘s threats to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members should recall very clearly that the previous Government did not threaten; it actually attacked the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission without consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we are told that this Government has abandoned the principle of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission and has imposed guidelines which we can now see were already imposed by the previous Government and accepted by the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is most unwelcome that what should be an independent organisation, the ABC as a result of perhaps prejudice, perhaps feebleness, perhaps unsureness as to its own standing and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, should take this sort of decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is in dramatic contrast with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is displayed by the commercial television channels in Brisbane and the rest of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771018_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the changes will not compromise the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, or its role in advising the Government on the nature and levels of assistance which should be afforded particular industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I realise that the pride of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of owning one’s car and the thrill of keeping up with the models and possibly with the Jones family are allimportant out we must realise too that it is a national responsibility to reduce the toll on Australia’s roads today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">independence</span> on the part of the  Speaker  is absolutely essential if the rights of the members of this Parliament are to be protected and, more importantly, if there is to be respect for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the importance of this institution within our democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that I hope will occur in those three years is that you will bring the Speakership to a level of <span class="highlight">independence</span> where the  Speaker  is vested with far more discretion than the Parliament has seen fit to give up until now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780221_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The status of that Chair determines what our status is, and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this Parliament over the Executive is determined by the extent to which the Chair is independent of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Government introduced the GovernorGeneral Act in 1974- the then Opposition supported it in both Houses- so that the GovernorGeneral, like a judge, could have the same immunity and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, so that he should be seen to have the same immunity and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, after he ceased to hold office, as he enjoyed while he was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with the remarks that have been made from time to time in relation to the importance of the Parliament having a greater degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Executive in some areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Australian Government has been disappointed to note that the peaceful transition of the New Hebrides to <span class="highlight">independence</span> currently appears threatened by the failure of the parties concerned to reach full agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to talk in the time afforded to me about the Government’s priorities, particularly the priority to provide effective assistance to the disadvantaged in ways that promote <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self-respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the elected Parliament is a weak and weakening institution; that the Executive Government is the principal beneficiary of the Parliament’s decline; and that the Judiciary is tending to compete with the Executive Government in exploiting the Parliament’s weakness but it is having its own <span class="highlight">independence</span> undermined through the initiatives of the Executive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that there will be some support for the sentiments of the amendment from the Government side of the House, from some honourable members who have been very energetic in ensuring the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was argued that the IAC’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> served two vital purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the Commission, because of its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, could- and I quote from  Sir John  Crawford ‘s report:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I note that  Sir John  recognised with regard to the important element of <span class="highlight">independence</span> that the Commission could:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, weakening of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC within broad guidelines will cast doubts on the quality and purpose of government decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence <span class="highlight">independence</span>, in the sense defined, is a precondition for the acceptable functioning of the IAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>L11UL 111 If  <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the  *4  111  VS  w  placed in jeopardy by the actions of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that under this legislation that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is likely to be eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the opportunity is now given to the Government to react unwisely to lobbying and therefore to erode the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the advice coming from the IAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, its <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be placed in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reason for our fear that the Government’s action will jeopardise the IAC’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> is the Government’s persistent misunderstanding of the advisory role of the IAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is particularly disappointing that the Opposition, in its amendment, and sections of the Press have tried to represent the Bill as one which is designed to undermine, to hobble, the Industries Assistance Commission, and to threaten its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that proposal lies the charge which the Opposition makes of the attack on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC- that is, its <span class="highlight">independence</span> to make a rational and intelligent assessment of the problems which confront an industry which is under its notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contend that that will influence greatly the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would compromise the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission if the Government were to say that the Commission would not report on a certain matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the element, the nature and the requirement of its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that such an objective is entirely reasonable and necessary provided- it is a major proviso- that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC is fully maintained and in no way compromised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I cannot comprehend the second part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford),  which suggests that the Government’s action in this Bill is threatening the basic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have stated at another stage of this debate, we have supported the Industries Assistance Commission and its <span class="highlight">independence</span> with all the vehemence that we can muster. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780302_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the meantime I believe that the person occupying this Chair must maintain his <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Executive and from any threat from the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The four major aims of the Yooralla pre-employment program are: First, to provide work experience and information; secondly, to endeavour to equalise the socialisation opportunities for disabled young people with those of their ablebodied peers; thirdly, to increase the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of disabled people so that as much as possible they may lead a life style independent of financial support systems; and fourthly, education of the public, both generally through the interaction of the able-bodied and disabled people in the program and with employers involved in the unit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is felt that the Yooralla pre-employment program offers a positive environment in which <span class="highlight">independence</span> can be not only encouraged but also shared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that answer I pointed out that the Commonwealth is concerned to ensure that policies of self-management are pursued throughout Australia because through those policies Aboriginals, wherever they are, are enabled to live in freedom and to have <span class="highlight">independence</span> in a way in which they can manage and control their own affairs like any other citizen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They spoke to me of their wish to have their councils control expenditure on community services in the islands which are at present provided by the Queensland Department, as one step towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the management of their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the Queensland Government’s policy of assimilation and of seeking to submerge, dilute and, if possible, breathe out the main cultural influence of the Aboriginal people encourages it to be opposed to any sorts of policies which will allow dignity, selfexpression, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the strengthening of that sense of Aboriginal cultural identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Queensland Government resents movements to provide more <span class="highlight">independence</span> and influence for the Aboriginal people in the community to give more strength to their cultural form of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The classic case is that of East Timor where there is a de jure government on the other side of the world in Portugal apparently not taking much continuing interest in the situation, a de facto rule right on the doorstep in Indonesia and an active group of <span class="highlight">independence</span> workers who want self-government for this area which is so close to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are the policies- policies of assimilation, policies of restriction and policies designed to prevent the Aboriginal people from establishing a clearer sense of cultural identity and the achievement of land rights, freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span>; those things which importantly go with acquisition of land and land rights, but more importantly for Aboriginals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780407_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further, is it the Government’s view, in line with section 1, sub-section (ii) of resolution 242 which calls for ‘acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political <span class="highlight">independence</span> of every State in the area’, that any new Palestinian State created as part of a peace settlement should be an independent entity rather than a province within either Israel or Jordan? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The third important purpose of this legislation is the provision of necessary <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Council in its actions, so that its advice can be provided to government freely and without unwarranted influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another provision designed to secure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Council is clause 25 of the Bill, which exempts the Council and those working for it from legal action in relation to any act done in good faith and in accordance with ASTEC’s powers and functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Major objectives  of that policy are to give the States and local government greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility to determine their expenditure priorities together with a concomitant increase in their financial capacity and flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before proceeding to speak about the treaty elements, I wish to recall that Australia and Papua New Guinea have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before Papua New Guinea moved to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that has been helped by the fact that the Opposition when in power was anxious to promote the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, New Guinea, prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, was a Trust Territory and as such was subject to scrutiny and report by a visiting UN Mission in 1971, which declared the desirability of a border change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the run up to <span class="highlight">independence</span> this matter was in fact raised in the Australian Parliament in 1971 and the Papua New Guinea Parliament in 1969 and 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea assumed the rights and obligations conferred upon it as a sovereign state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those initiatives led to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea and the laying of the foundation for this agreement which I trust will be a lasting and very sound agreement between both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In further pursuit of full <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Council there is clause 25. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So, we see that much of the Bill is related to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have given the history leading to the present ASTEC I have shown how the Government has provided <span class="highlight">independence</span> for ASTEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my speech I made it very clear that one of the efforts behind the wording of this Bill was to have <span class="highlight">independence</span>, which we tried to achieve through a number of the clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was a bit surprised at the assertion of the honourable member for Hotham that we would cripple the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the council if we put members of this Parliament on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a family owns a house the members of the family virtually have some <span class="highlight">independence</span>, some little castle, as it were, to which they can retire secure in the knowledge that no one can knock on the door and throw them out in the street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also inform the House that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  left Australia yesterday to represent the Government at the Western Samoa <span class="highlight">independence</span> celebrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the honourable member for Brisbane that it was a Labor Government which established the IAC- and established it with a very high degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> is something which the current Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  absolutely fails to understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For it to function efficiently and effectively it must remain an independent advisory body, and while I am Minister and while this Government is in office we will ensure that its <span class="highlight">independence</span> is maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was put forward by the then Opposition as representing a philosophical approach based on the desirability of decentralising government, giving greater freedom to lower tiers of government and increasing their budgetary <span class="highlight">independence</span> and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since Federation in 1 90 1 , the States have experienced successive reductions in their financial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Commonwealth Government is now making an explicit effort to reverse this trend and restore to the States a greater measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the raising and disposal of their revenues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no great acceleration in those successive reductions in <span class="highlight">independence</span> than occurred in the years 1972 to 1975, during the Whitlam era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I put it to the House that that would cause a political confrontation of the nature of the confrontations that arose when the colonies of Great Britain were themselves seeking either full <span class="highlight">independence</span> or self-government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is correct in a strictly legal sense but as we advance down the path towards statehood or perhaps even a branch track to <span class="highlight">independence</span> there could come a time when the conventions and political arrangements between the two entities are such that the Territory could have the legislative capacity to pass laws that were contradictory to the laws of the United Kingdom, just as South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member has earned a reputation in this House of being an independent Liberal, a man with a degree of conscience, a man who stood up and raised his voice about the barbaric treatment by the Indonesians of the little East Timorese, who are still fighting for their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 26 signatories to the declaration of the United Nations made on 1 January 1942 expressed their commitment that complete victory over their enemies was essential to defend life, liberty, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Secretary-General’s report will be heavily influenced by the finding of his Special Representative,  Mr Ahtisaari  of Finland, who is currently in Namibia to assess the political situation on the ground and the prospects for an orderly transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Namibia, through an initiative inspired and carried through by the Western powers, and substantially assisted by the presidents of the socalled front line states- Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Botswana- the situation has reached the stage where there is now a real opportunity to reach a satisfactory and internationally acceptable transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and majority rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then there is the problem of a small nation struggling for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, having the support and encouragement of well intentioned people but nevertheless facing the fundamental problems faced by many developing countries, of having no real infrastructure in health, housing and education matters and having no political capacity to control in a normal way the usual problems of a small nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Welcome as it is, desirable as it must be and needing all the support we can give it, the proposal of the five western members of the Security Council is to ensure that conditions are established to allow an impartial electoral process leading to free and fair elections and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780823_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My researches have indicated that although originally the inability of members of the judiciary to sit in this place was related to the matter of parliamentary privilege, of more recent times in the House of Commons it has been made quite clear that it was in order to retain the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary and the position of the judiciary as being quite free from party political controversy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781026_reps_31_hor111/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead it suggests a mischievous interpretation of the conflicts, an interpretation that ignores history, an interpretation that denies the struggle of the Vietnamese and Kampuchean people to maintain <span class="highlight">independence</span>, an interpretation that excuses the America atrocities and consequent responsibilities in the region, an interpretation that alleges the innocence of the United States and the innocence of Australia, an interpretation that reduces the conflict to a rivalry between the communists super powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790227_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The tax sharing arrangements which this Government has put into place over the past three years and which give to the States a percentage of income tax revenue and flexibility within that percentage to spend the money on what they wish have, I think, contributed enormously to the financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> of various State governments and have enabled individual State governments to make very significant revenue concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790502_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point that I find depressing, having been to South Africa this year and having talked to so many people, and looking at the history of Rhodesia, is that it is now apparent that the Rhodesian Front of Ian Smith is prepared to accept conditions which it would have thought intolerable at the time of the Unilateral Declaration of <span class="highlight">Independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Bill that is to come before the Senate- it is going to be steamrolled through the Senate according to the Prime Minister; it will be law in the next week or so- or in regard to the national wage cases, this Government is not prepared to see the traditional <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>Perhaps one of the reasons for that is that Australia has 70 per cent <span class="highlight">independence</span> with its own oil reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Chairman, I have to support the view you expressed earlier in the debate; that it is a pity the Government has seen fit once again to interfere with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Remuneration Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we ought to have a little more understanding about how the Tribunal feels to be told that it is an independent tribunal and then to have its <span class="highlight">independence</span> stripped away as it has been stripped away on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to be a little more sensitive to the feelings of people who ought to be in a position of complete and absolute <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, so that its industrial base will have an adequate gas supply and give it a level of energy <span class="highlight">independence</span> which will be almost unparalleled in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That cannot be jeopardised by any plans by any corporate group to export a level of gas at an earlier stage rather than a later stage, which would happen to put that <span class="highlight">independence</span> in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that all special legislative and administrative measures affecting Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders should be based on respect for individual dignity and human rights and should be designed to develop selfrespect, <span class="highlight">independence</span>, self-management and self-sufficiency of Aboriginals and Islanders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Councils are legally able to carry out many of the functions provided by the Public Service administration and establish a greater degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and selfmanagement by raising their own revenues, receiving other public moneys and accepting responsibility for provision of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bureau does not have the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, standing or authority at law or in common practice of a police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-21-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The balance that the spokesman for the Opposition seems to be seeking to achieve is one that places an emphasis on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the cultural identities and traditions, whereas the Bill sets out to make the point, in a rather deliberate fashion, that the independent cultural traditions of various ethnic groups have great value, that they are important, and that they must be promoted, and there is an emphasis on ensuring that those conditions contribute to the total Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberty has long been dependent upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the functions that each of the areas of government have in our system and their effective separation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative scheme is to effect the transfer of the seat of the High Court, the judicial arm of power under our Constitution, to Canberra and to perfect its <span class="highlight">independence</span> from departmenttal control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the part of the judiciary in particular, it is dependent upon separation, upon <span class="highlight">independence</span> and upon impartiality, and particularly impartiality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The winning of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by the judiciary is generally accepted to have occurred when the Act of Settlement of 1702 altered the tenure of judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Australian Constitution, the provision in section 72 that a judge’s honorarium may not be diminished during his term of office may be seen as an additional protection of that <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another rule designed to protect the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary is the protection from legal process for acts done by judges in their judicial capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This provision of the law is not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but for the benefit of the public, whose interest it is that the judges should be at liberty to exercise their powers with <span class="highlight">independence</span> and without fear of consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many factors which commentators on the subject of the separation doctrine concede led to the concept of judicial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such matters as these, in my view, do not detract from the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These matters having been examined briefly, <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary means two things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional view ofthe gaining of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by the judiciary supports this functional approach even if historically the developments were based on functions which were less clearly defined and even if other factors were also involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Court of Australia Bill 1979, which we are now discussing, ensuring a greater degree of administrative <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the High Court, are a good example of a practical approach towards this end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, <span class="highlight">independence</span> is not only a right but also a duty if the system is to function properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The making of public statements concerning matters on which other branches are engaged must therefore be avoided if the judiciary’s own <span class="highlight">independence</span> is to be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The discussion of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Executive and Parliament may suggest that these are the only threats to judicial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and that public confidence can be maintained where the judiciary engages in political activity or public comment as long as the activity is seen to be a sign of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, partisan activity can lead to a weakening of <span class="highlight">independence</span> when governments change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary and the respect which is accorded to it in the community is not intended for the benefit of the judiciary but for the benefit of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any loss of <span class="highlight">independence</span> on the part of the judiciary will lead to a corresponding loss of respect in the community and the ultimate failure of our legal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to provide the High Court with a measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from departmental control that reflects the special position accorded the Court by the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I question how much <span class="highlight">independence</span> the Court is accorded from those people with wealth who make substantial gifts to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has the Government reneged on its promises with regard to the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty, but it has also, I believe, been less than frank in its policy in relation to another major input of the sugar industry in determining its predictability and its <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the vagaries of the weather^ I refer to the Bundaberg irrigation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was our policy, I believe correctly, that since the Northern Territory in particular is rapidly proceeding towards full <span class="highlight">independence</span>- it has a new constitution and the same rights as other States of the Commonwealth- therefore it would not be proper for a committee of the Federal Parliament to involve itself in its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, at this stage that is not possible or practical, but it is an area in which we should aim to achieve some <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition to accounting for almost 40 per cent of total private employment, small firms provide a productive outlet for the energies of a larger group of enterprising people who seek <span class="highlight">independence</span> rather than working for large organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only has the political face of Africa changed but with it significant economic and social opportunities have opened up to the people of that continent since their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is heartening to see that the present Government at least has come to realise the contribution that natural gas can make to Australia’s energy <span class="highlight">independence</span> and also the importance of having a well-planned gas grid connecting the major demand and supply centres of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that if natural gas is to make a significant contribution to Australia’s energy <span class="highlight">independence</span>- and we believe this to be so- a well-planned, co-ordinated approach to development must be adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would give us a level of energy <span class="highlight">independence</span> which would be quite luxurious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by the administration of  Mr Ian  Smith in 1965 sowed the seeds of a political struggle in Rhodesia between black nationalists and white settler parties that a few years later erupted into a bloody civil war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agreement has now been reached on an <span class="highlight">independence</span> constitution, and on arrangements for the transitional period leading to the holding of free and fully democratic elections in Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wish to state the Government’s position on the removal of the sanctions that have been in force against Rhodesia since the unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems clear to the Government, however, that when all the Rhodesian parties concerned and the British Government have freely agreed to an <span class="highlight">independence</span> Constitution, freely agreed on arrangements for the holding of elections and the implementation of that Constitution, and when British authority has been re-established in Rhodesia for the purpose of instituting those arrangements, then the objectives for which sanctions were originally imposed will have been achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Australia, however, as we are likely to have Australian military and civilian personnel and an Australian liaison office in Rhodesia during the period leading up to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and as we will, in the circumstances I have described, be satisfied that the objectives for which sanctions were imposed have been achieved, the Government considers- I believe all Members of the House will agree with this-that it would be inappropriate for it to maintain sanctions during that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate to the honourable member, however, that there is no good reason why this matter should have been raised with me as the ABC is responsible for decisions taken about programming matters, and this is not an area in which I wish to interfere with the Commission ‘s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>Action has been taken to upgrade the Unit in name and status, and give it more <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></li>
