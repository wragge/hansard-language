<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This, too, is a matter that would need to be referred to the Department of External Affairs, lt is true that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is to be granted to Fiji and I gather that it is to take effect from October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have the matter examined to see whether there is a case at this time, concurrently with this move to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, to upgrade or advance our representation in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the proposal for Fiji to be granted <span class="highlight">independence</span> in October and in view of Australia’s substantial trade and business interests in that country as well as our interests in Nandi Airport, will the Government give early consideration to raising the status of our representation in Fiji? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acknowledging what  Senator Georges  has just said, all I wish to say is that the greatest contribution that senators and members of the House of Representatives could make to persuading the Government to the point of view he has put would be the exercise of complete responsibility in visits to New Guinea, having regard to the national objective that Australia has, namely, to induce the Territory to a proper stage for <span class="highlight">independence</span> to be given at the time of its own choosing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where did the Minister obtain the view that the granting of Aboriginal land rights will hinder the progress of Aboriginal people towards selfdetermination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls not this way of conducting business incompatible with Cambodian <span class="highlight">independence</span> and incompatible with the proper relations which should exist between the Australian Government and the Government of Cambodia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General may recall that on Thursday last I asked him a question regarding the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of magistrates in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the AttorneyGeneral lake immediate steps to separate magistrates from his Department and give them the same degree  of  <span class="highlight">independence</span> as is enjoyed by judges? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories seen the statement made yesterday by Brigadier Eldridge, the retiring joint force commander in New Guinea, in which he called for the handing over of control of New Guinea’s armed forces before the granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Postmaster-General’s Department, Central Administration Board’s Policy of recentralising and concentrating certain staffs, under what is called the Area Management Project, to the great detriment of the economies of the towns and related rural areas, and to the detriment of the overall morale, efficiency and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Post Office is against the public interest and should be made the subject of special investigation by the Senate’s Social Environment Committee and by the Senate’s Finance and Government Operations Standing Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view the United States has done everything in its power to ensure a negotiated settlement and to maintain the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of South Vietnam and not to abandon the people of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding all that, the trade union movement will fight for its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and will survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of conflict inside the Government coalition as to the date when <span class="highlight">independence</span> shall begin, as to when self government shall begin and as to the powers that ministers shall have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now as Papua New Guinea stands on the threshold of <span class="highlight">independence</span> this Bill is right and proper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: In view of the serious drought prevailing in the highland area of New Guinea and coinciding with the delicate negotiations for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, will the Minister indicate what measures are being taken by the Australian Government to assist the Government of Papua New Guinea in alleviating this most unfortunate situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is a para-military force: Is it in effect a force which could be used or abused to impose military law in the future, and will such a force have a continuing role after <span class="highlight">independence</span> has been granted to the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the announcement by the Minister an indication of growing unrest in the Territory and clear evidence that the Australian Government’s policy of forcing <span class="highlight">independence</span> on an unwilling Territory, Government and people is fundamentally wrong and potentially dangerous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 presume that these Bills have no particular application to the position of the judges of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea, but they no doubt must have some of the same concern that public servants have in regard to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to what their position will be after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No compact would have been arrived at if the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and sovereignty of the States were not recognised and preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strictly speaking, had the colonists’ side lost in the American War of <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, George Washington could well have been executed for treason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I assure the honourable senator once again that under this Government the Australian Broadcasting Commission is guaranteed political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will Australian Servicemen be with the armed forces of Papua New Guinea after it achieves <span class="highlight">independence</span> on 1 December, 1 974: if so, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it is incredible that the Labor Party and its Prime Minister who, in the past, have sought to emphasise Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be seeking the exercise of a colonial power to effect in Australia what could be achieved by Australians themselves in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the honourable senator will know that it is the policy of the Government that the ABC in all of its programming arrangements shall be completely independent and that it is guaranteed policital and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Out of that <span class="highlight">independence</span> which the richness of an income of $15,000 a year gives to me, I maintain that my attitude in this matter is not actuated in the slightest degree by political votes, of which throughout my whole career I have been just as independent as I have been of Ministers and party leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then I have been overseas on a mission to Europe from 14 to 27 December 1974 and from 30 December 1974 to 21 January 1975, for another Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting from 23 April to 11 May 1975 and overnight in Singapore on 9 August 1975.I have been invited to the Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Celebrations from 14 to 17 September 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Department believes effectiveness can only be determined in relation to the degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, socially, medically and financially, which the patient achieves, it is looking at methods by which it can develop research into, and evaluation of, rehabilitation procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That such a station would therefore represent a further deterioration of Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and initiatives towards a non-aligned and peaceful foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the Minister’s attention current Press speculation regarding the future <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s taking advertising and changes in the composition of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is any form of government organisation to be involved in ethnic broadcasting; if so, would it have statutory <span class="highlight">independence</span> of any government department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-68-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) A few overseas posts, including the office in Lisbon, have reported a small number of inquiries from people who had left Angola during the emergency situation there and since <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Republic of Nauru, a small island with some 7000 people in the Pacific Ocean, was originally a mandated territory which gained its <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to that there was provision in its legal structure for appeals to our High Court and this, of course, lapsed on the Republic gaining its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eschew all means, direct or indirect, of diminishing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop methods for publicly funding the Commission which will prevent the granting or withholding of funds being used as a method of diminishing its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the amalgamation destroy or harm the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Significantly, the Commonwealth has also placed special emphasis on ‘untied’ funds for the States and their authorities, particularly through the tax sharing arrangements with the States and local government, thus enhancing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility of the States and their authorities in financial matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am speaking from memory, but I think it was negotiated by the Public Service Board prior to the granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no intention to jeopardise the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister assure the Senate that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of this advisory body will not be jeopardised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought I made it perfectly clear in my speech during the second reading debate that I agreed with all parts of the Oppostion’s proposition except- it was an important exceptionwhere it stated that the Senate deplored the Government threatening the basic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission by its emphasis upon narrow and variable guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that there is a common recognition that a responsible balance must be established between the undoubted financial prerogative of the Executive Government and the clear and honest preservation of that <span class="highlight">independence</span> of parliament, which is so vital to the Westminster system, whereby parliament manages and is seen to manage its own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 prohibit persons or companies from owning or holding a controlling interest in more than one commercial broadcasting station in metropolitan areas only, and therefore do not apply in non-metropolitan towns and cities: if so ( a ) what are the reasons for this anomaly; ( b ) do the present ownership and control provisions discriminate against non-metropolitan towns and cities because, whilst the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of capital city radio stations is statutorily guaranteed, radio stations operating within any other city may all be owned or controlled by one person or company with legal impunity; and (c) will the Minister consider amending these provisions to guarantee the same legislative safeguards to non-metropolitan towns and cities as those applying to metropolitan areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Justice  Kirby said that the legislation was setting out to destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission and that as far as he was concerned it was probably unconstitutional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Opposition in relation to the general question which has been dealt with by the Minister in his statement is that we believe that Australia’s administration of Papua and New Guinea must be to work to bring about <span class="highlight">independence</span> and an economically viable nationhood as early as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, in the Opposition, endorse the statements made by  Mr Whitlam  on behalf of the whole Parliamentary Labor Party investigatory group on the timing of selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we support the undertaking made by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives,  Mr Whitlam,  that future Labor governments would continue financial grants and technical and advisory assistance on a generous scale after <span class="highlight">independence</span> if the independent government wishes, and that a Labor government would be prepared to put this assistance on a treaty basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, there were growing pains associated with <span class="highlight">independence</span> in those countries, but at least the situation was better than in countries where reform was delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its immediate consequences must be a Communist takeover of South Vietnam snuffing out the hope of freedom and of democratic <span class="highlight">independence</span> in that country and extending the area of Communist control closer to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To ensure that we do not relinquish any more of our heritage and to safeguard our national <span class="highlight">independence</span>, legislative restrictions should be imposed on the inflow of overseas investment before it is too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I fully support the comments that have been made by the Governor-General in appreciating the task that is ahead of us in bringing sound <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is having great success in assisting this Territory to achieve the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which it desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is much of importance in the comments about New Guinea, but I am one ;who firmly believes that in leading New Guinea to its <span class="highlight">independence</span> - and the move :will be accelerated in the future - we should hold fast to the view that New Guinea must have a sound economic base -before it becomes dissociated from the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who, over the years, have attempted to gain political capital from the situation in New Guinea or have tried to find people in the community who would demand <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Territory have done a great disservice to the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But we have reached the stage now where we have not been so successful in this aim as we were during the last generation because the people of the Territory now are looking for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy of this Government has been, and still is, that the people of the Territory can have self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> when the majority of them decide that they are ready to accept <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is doing all it can to assist these people in their development, and when the people themselves consider - not when we consider - that they are ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and when the majority of the people support a claim for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, they can have that <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The people of the ‘Highlands have made it crystal clear that they are opposed to self government and that they are opposed to <span class="highlight">independence</span> because they are not ready for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia and the United Nations want to see the Territory and the Territory of New Guinea as one nation when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I decry such a thing, but if it does happen it will be because of the policies of the Australian Labor Party and not of the Government It will not be brought about because of the view of the majority of the people of New Guinea, who do not want <span class="highlight">independence</span> at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But such a policy is being advocated by  Mr Whitlam  who, in a recent visit to the Territory, announced a date for self government and a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> regardless of whether the people want it or are ready for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Parliamentary Draftsman, although still under the Secretary of the Department in a formal sense, has come to occupy a position of some <span class="highlight">independence</span> and, in practice, is now only nominally responsible to the Head of the Department in relation to professional work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the people of Papua and New Guinea wish Australia to maintain some sort of supervision over their well being I do not think that any service is done to Australia by inflaming the people of Papua and New Guinea to ask for <span class="highlight">independence</span> before they either are ready to receive it or have the ability to administer their own affairs when they are granted <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that  Senator Gair  will agree with me when  I  say that most honourable senators who met the members of the House of Assembly when they visited Canberra recently are under the impression that their main preoccupation was trying to persuade members of the Commonwealth Parliament that they should not press <span class="highlight">independence</span> upon Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all very well for the United Kingdom to say to the people of Fiji: ‘We are giving you your <span class="highlight">independence</span>’, as the United Kingdom is in the process of doing, but when the United Kingdom walks out of Fiji someone has to pick up some of the tabs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the officers and appointees to which I have been referring ought to have the security of parliamentary fixing of their salaries because it gives them an <span class="highlight">independence</span> which they may well exercise and feel they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would certainly agree with  Senator Greenwood  that this Office of Parliamentary Counsel, whatever the salary may be should have some <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt seeks to solve the problem by the creation of the first 3 offices to the statutory Office of Parliamentary Counsel and by according to those offices a degree of status, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and salary together with the stiff that will be under their control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may be for several purposes, but in the matter of salaries one of the reasons may bc to ensure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the officers That view is not confined to the Senate and is not confined to my Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (2) The Australian Government has accepted an invitation from the Indonesian Foreign Minister to attend a meeting of Asian and Pacific countries in Djakarta on 16th and 17th May in an effort to help mobilise international opinion to assure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and neutrality of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my Press statement on Cambodia on 27th April I said that Australia found especially valid the Indonesian Foreign Minister’s approach, since it proposed that the agenda would be confined to three simple points: the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and neutralisation of Cambodia; non-intervention; and reactivation of the International Control Commission for Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Committee considers that this objective would be advanced by the transfer of the administration of the health insurance scheme from the Commonwealth Department nf Health to a National Health Insurance Commission with as much <span class="highlight">independence</span> as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the proposal for Fiji to be granted <span class="highlight">independence</span> in October and in view of Australia’s substantial trade and business interests in that country as well as our interests in Nandi Airport, will the Government give early consideration to raising the status of our representation in Fiji? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is to be granted to Fiji and I gather that it is to take effect from October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will have the matter examined to see whether there is a case at this time, concurrently with this move to <span class="highlight">independence</span>,  to upgrade or advance our representation in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind, that is a much more satisfactory way of dealing with a situation such as this, lt gives a security of tenure and it preserves what I would have expected to be one of the objectives in setting up these committees; and that is the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the members of the committees and their ability to express, as they would see it, their judgment on a particular issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is its structure, as drafted in the Bill, carefully aimed at complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Government, but, in clause 9, the Bill specifically provides for such <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">independence</span> brings with it the need for the Corporation to1 be completely selfgenerating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is intended, in keeping with the AIDC’s desired <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Government, that the capital of the Corporation not immediately required for the purposes of the Corporation may be invested for the purposes of producing income. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This very <span class="highlight">independence</span> and freedom however, calls for some safeguard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700522_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed lo the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories: I ask: 1-las the Government any reason for believing that the policy it has consistently followed wilh respect lo the question of  selfdetermination  in Papua and New Guinea, namely that self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be granted as and when the people of the Territory themselves ask for it, is in error? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon Fiji becoming a country within the Commonwealth of Nations following the grant of <span class="highlight">independence</span> appropriate legislative action would betakento ensure that citizens of Fiji in Australia continue to have the status of British Subjects which they now have by virtue of their being citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700602_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable senator will be aware Australia, at the invitation of the Indonesian Foreign Minister, took part in the Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Djakarta on 16th and 17th May to discuss means of ensuring the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand it would appear to me that there should be an appearance of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which comes from security of tenure and not from the simple holding of office during the Minister’s pleasure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The traditional <span class="highlight">independence</span> has been taken away from these bodies under this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These committees, especially the appeal body, are of such importance that something will have to be done to ensure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the persons who exercise the functions of these important offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The persons who hold these offices should have some <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is it not also adding weight to the argument which has been put forward to say that once these people have been selected by such eminent bodies there should be some security of tenure and some <span class="highlight">independence</span> of office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statute books are full of provisions which give persons some kind of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and some security, but there is also provision for termination in the event of what  Senator Gair  has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is much more important than many of the other matters which are committed to bodies which have some <span class="highlight">independence</span> and some security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is important that these bodies should have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is appropriate to the discharge of their function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is on the appeals committee but 1 do not like the conjunction of the complete lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of these bodies together wilh the provision that in the first instance he does not have to act on the recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700603_senate_27_s44/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very shortly, I believe that the basic reason why this principle has appealed to me and why it should commend itself to this chamber is that officers performing functions such as those of officers who are appointed under these Acts not only should have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> to carry out their functions but, irrespective of what the movements in their salaries may be, should be seen to be independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700610_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been my view that as Australia develops and there is an increasing <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this country the problems it faces are increasing, and there has to be a chamber of Parliament in which the long term interests of the Australian people and their sentiments, hopes, aspirations and long term needs reside in the minds of its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite seem to envy the proper <span class="highlight">independence</span> and freedom which honourable senators on this side of the chamber enjoy enabling the distinguished members of the Liberal-Country Party coalition Senate team and I to vote according to our judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all,  Sir Wilfrid  was a man with strongly held views on <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700818_senate_27_s45/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, he did noL let his well known political convictions overrule his <span class="highlight">independence</span> of mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700818_senate_27_s45/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes, however, that it would be unwise to bring the question of Cambodia before the United Nations at this stage because it might force certain members who have so far kept their options with regard to the Cambodian Government to take decisions that could be harmful to Cambodia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on to say that the actions which have been taken in South Vietnam will preserve the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of small nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If both the Government’s arguments are valid - that intervention in South Vietnam was to guarantee small nations <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to prevent aggression being undertaken against small nations, and that there has been aggression against Cambodia - it seems to me that something is completely contradictory in what the Government is saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much as we might like to speak of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate, and it is an independent body in a constitutional sense, the actual work flow comes from the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact the House of Representatives has determined a new time schedule and, whether we like it or not, we are now in the position where we must have cognisance of that and accommodate ourselves to it so far as is consistent with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe it is unfortunate in the extreme that when a member of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Wills, visits that country and expresses a point of view which may assist the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of Cambodia, he should be precluded from taking part in any expression of opinion on the subject in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as that is a lawful campaign for the expression of public views it indicates the type of thinking which directs that campaign here and which precludes one of the Labor Party’s acknowledged members from participation in the campaign simply because he is favourable to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Cambodia and, incidentally, supports our fighting troops in that areas of Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we would all agree that amongst Opposition members there is very tight allegiance and strict adherence to the Party view, to the extent that when Captain Benson, who was a member of the Labor Party in another place, was immediately excluded from the Party when he attempted to show some <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear the Opposition attempting to draw some comparison with other members of my Party and members of the Liberal Party who showed some <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore they regard the Australian presence as an indication of our participation in their security and as a guarantee that there is an interest in the preservation of the integrity of those new nations who do not wish to be subverted so early in the history of their <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the colonial powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  President  went on to recall that in a speech of 27th June 1970,  President  Thieu had emphasised that his government will concentrate on efforts within South Vietnam; that his country will always respect the territory, borders, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and neutrality of Cambodia and will not interfere in its internal politics; and that the South Vietnamese Government does not advocate stationing troops permanently in Cambodia or sendng the South Vietnamese Army to fight the war for the Cambodian Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people concerned had a sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, notwithstanding the depressing environment - I must use that term - and a sense of dignity in their twilight years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of the strictures passed upon its <span class="highlight">independence</span> by members of the Australian Labor Party I regard that body of judicial and quasi-judicial persons - that is, of nonprofessional members, sitting, however, judicially - as totally impartial, totally neutral, and totally independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have read the Hansard report of the consideration of Division 431 by the appropriate estimates committee and I have found that although  Senator McClelland  examined the whole question of assistance to the arts, no examination was made of the literary scholarships which are awarded each year to writers to whom the grants will give sufficient <span class="highlight">independence</span> to enable them to develop a work of merit which will result in credit and possibly profit to themselves as well as credit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONI am sure that it is accepted historically that the decision of this Government and the legislative decisions that were taken by the Parliament to provide an oil search subsidy have had the effect of enabling Australia to come quite close to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in relation to oil supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of the overwhelming opinion of anthropologists and researchers that the provision of traditional land rights is necessary for economic and social <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Aboriginal communities, why has the Minister chosen to ignor such expert opinion and denied land rights to the Aboriginal people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is an inherent suspicion of change, perhaps even an abhorrence of Government control, in the tradition of <span class="highlight">independence</span> that has been built up in the 150 to 200 years of existence of the Australian wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To my mind, and I think to the minds of a lot of Territorians, the conservative elements will be banded together in order to keep this division; in other words, to keep <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Papua and New Guinea, in conformity with the policy of the Government, for as long as it can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That will mean that this office will have an <span class="highlight">independence</span> that is completely clear so that any suspicion that undue limitations are placed upon the amplitude of the Public Solicitor’s authority will disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The need to affirm the policy of the Australian Government of not imposing upon the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea selfgovernment or <span class="highlight">independence</span> contrary to the freely-expressed wishes of the people through their Parliamentary representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they were fact finding trips it is surprising that on the very first occasion in 1970 when he visited the Territory after a lapse of some5 or 6 years he should state before he had gone outside of Port Moresby that the policy of the Australian Labor Party was self government for the Territory in 1972 and <span class="highlight">independence</span> by 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of the section of its platform relating to New Guinea - a platform which was drawn up at a conference held in August 1969  -  will show that there is no suggestion of immediate self government and a 1976 target of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that score there is some reason for the Australian Labor Party to indicate whether it proposes to abide by its own platform, whether it proposes to abide by the statement which  Mr Whitlam  has made or whether it is prepared to acknowledge that the House of Assembly in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea desires that the target dates for self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be set with its concurrence, which is a viewpoint which has been emphatically denied by  Mr Whitlam  on various occasions in the 2 years that he has visited the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia and, until recently, members of both - all political parties - major political parties have believed that that obligation is best discharged with its twin facets by developing the social, political and economic abilities of the people of the Territory so that we can ultimately - when they have self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> - maintain friendly relations on the basis that one country has discharged honourably the trusteeship obligation which it had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under Article 76 of the United Nations Charter - not by a decision of the Assembly or of the Council - we have an obligation to promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its people and - I stress these words - the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years the Australian Government has maintained that it will work towards the self government and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the people of the Territory in partnership with the House of Assembly, which was established in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And we will take account of those views instead of imposing our views on them as to a date for self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition did not speak of complete self-government or of complete <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said, without prior consultation with anybody, that there could not be any self government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> in relation to matters of external affairs or defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that on 3 occasions the House of Assembly has indicated specifically to the United Nations and to the Australian Government that questions of self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> are for the members of the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we in this Senate owe it not only to the people of Australia but also to the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea to affirm positively that we respect their developing democracy and that we will not impose upon them self-government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> contrary to their wishes, it is up to the Australian Labor Party to indicate clearly and emphatically whether it believes in democracy in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea or whether, contrary to democracy, it will impose the wishes of its own authoritarian party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia’s administration of Papua and New Guinea must be to work to bring about <span class="highlight">independence</span> and an economically viable nationhood as early as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the years they have made various pronouncements about the necessity for freeing the colonial peoples and not allowing any excuses - whether it be the backwardness of the people, their lack of education or lack of performance - for colonial peoples not proceeding rapidly to self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having considered the report of the Trusteeship Council covering the period from 20 June 1969 to 19 June 1970 and the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Colonial Countries and Peoples; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Nations said: 1 Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Papua and the Trust Territory of New Guinea to self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in accordance with General Assembly resolution 154 (XV) and the trusteeship agreement of 13th December 1946; 2 Reaffirms further its previous resolutions regarding Papua and the Trust Territory of New Guinea; 3 Takes note of the arrangements made by the Trusteeship Council in accordance with paragraph 5 of Resolution 2590 (XXIV) and in consultation with the special Committee on the Situation with regard to the implementation of the Declaration of the Granting of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Colonial Countries and People, concerning the composition of its forthcoming periodic visiting mission to the Trust Territory of New Guinea in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is Australia: to prescribe, in consultation with the freely elected representatives of the people, a specific timetable for the free exercise by the people of Papua and the Trust Territory of New Guinea of their right to selfdetermination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to report to the Trusteeship Council and to the Special Committee on the action taken in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Leave out all words after ‘need*, insert ‘to affirm the policy of self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in accordance with” the decisions of the United Nations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sir, the  following words: in order to discuss the need to affirm the policy of self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent my moving the addition of the following words to the terms of the motion before the Chair - in order to discuss the need to affirm the policy of self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, we do not see how anyone could oppose a motion which merely asserts that self government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> should not be imposed upon the people of the Territory contrary to the freely expressed wishes of the people through their parliamentary representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some discussion on the question whether the people of New Guinea are ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think <span class="highlight">independence</span> is inevitable and I think it will come soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I also want to make it clear that I do not believe that <span class="highlight">independence</span> will come because New Guinea is united or ready for indepencene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe it will come because the Government of this country believes in its heart that New Guinea is ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New Guinea today there is a large number  of  completely unsophisticated people who would not know the meaning of <span class="highlight">independence</span> if you were to mention it to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment the people of that section are inclined to go for <span class="highlight">independence</span>  Got  so much because in their hearts many of them believe that they are entirely ready for it, but because they think that it must come and that outside world opinion will force it on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">independence</span> for New Guinea is inevitable and within a very short period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is easy to impose <span class="highlight">independence</span> upon a country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have  no  hesitation  in  saying that I do not think that New Guinea is yet ready to become governmentally or economically viable, but I accept the situation that the people of New Guinea will be given their <span class="highlight">independence</span> regardless of whether they are ready for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> will be imposed upon New Guinea, not because of the attitude of the people there and not because of the attitude of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people were accused of having a nineteenth century attitude when they said that parts of Africa were not ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were made in Africa by people who were infinitely surer that Africa was ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span> than are the people who talk about <span class="highlight">independence</span> for New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the people who talk so glibly of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for New Guinea to show me that when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes New Guinea will not break out into another Congo. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances, and conceding as I said before that because of pressures from outside which we were not game to resist <span class="highlight">independence</span> will come, I want now to refer to statements made by  Mr Whitlam  to show that in my view they have been injudicious and reckless and have not contributed to the welfare of the people of New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has assured the people of New Guinea of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by a definite date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went even further and informed them that there would be no problems about money with <span class="highlight">independence</span> because Australia would pick up the bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it wise to say to the people of a country approaching <span class="highlight">independence</span> that an outside body will pick up the bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know how many nations today which have granted <span class="highlight">independence</span> to countries formerly under their control have informed them, as  Mr Whitlam  has informed New Guinea, that once those countries become independent their bills will be paid for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> is not a matter of breaking out a flag on a mast and then declaring a party; <span class="highlight">independence</span> is something that involves very serious problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When <span class="highlight">independence</span> is given to a country, one of the first things required by that country is an administrative class or group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some who, 1 am pleased to see, have been given positions of considerable importance, but there does not exist in New Guinea today anything like the number of trained administrators that would be necessary to enable <span class="highlight">independence</span> to function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody is in favour of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua and New Guinea, but let us not fail to recognise the immense difficulties of running an independent country in a place where the problems of economic viability are very considerable, where there is not an administrative class and where education has not attained a standard at which the great bulk of the people can understand even what <span class="highlight">independence</span> means, let alone function under it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of my Party is that whether or not we think the people of Papua and New Guinea are ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, they are going to get it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must face the facts and be realistic; they will gain <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the very near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party accepts that <span class="highlight">independence</span> will come, but my Party says that any attempt to have a centralised government controlling the whole of the area is bound to fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of my Party is that we must introduce a federal system of autonomous States that would provide for cases such as Bougainville that want <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us introduce a decentralised scheme of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of autonomous States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that we accept that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is coming in the near future, our view is that a system of the kind I have mentioned will have to be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to affirm the policy of the Australian Government of not imposing upon the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea self government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> contrary to the freely expressed wishes of the people through their parliamentary representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somebody must be spokesman on their behalf because they fear <span class="highlight">independence</span> coming to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He claimed that the House of Assembly on numerous occasions had said that it did not want <span class="highlight">independence</span> yet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to promote the political, economic, social, and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and ite peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are tens of thousands of people in Papua and New Guinea who are prepared to obtain <span class="highlight">independence</span> and if the Government is going to stick to its current attitudes in perpetuity sooner or later blood will be spilt there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will force these people to seize their <span class="highlight">independence</span> by the use of guns and bullets if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party attitude of setting down a programme for <span class="highlight">independence</span> is the right one, the humane one and the Christian one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government is not going to give the House of Assembly and the Territory the right to decide how money shall, be spent, whether it is raised internally by taxes or whether it comes from this country as part of our quota of foreign aid, how is it going to take these people along this slow, tortuous and gradual path towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> that the honourable senator was so delighted to tell us was the right thing to do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Greenwood’s  motion contains these words:  - of not imposing upon the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea self government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> contrary to the freely expressed wishes of the people through their parliamentary representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of affirming that we will not impose self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> upon the people of the Territory contrary to their freely expressed wishes through their parliamentary representatives,  Senator Murphy  sought to introduce an amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now on the record as the expression of his opinion that <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self government should be accorded to the peoples of Papua and New <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cant  has reminded us tonight that the Leader of the Opposition asserted that, if he were to become Leader of the Government of this country, Australia would ensure that there was self government in the Territory in 1972 and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Territory in 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the statements of the Leader of the Opposition on Papua and New Guinea, supported today in this chamber, are an arrogant interference which shows contempt for the capacity and ability of the people of the Territory in their own time to develop to a situation where they will decide when they will take self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, lt is greatly lo be regretted that  Mr. Whitlam’s  intervention cannot be divorced from the feeling that he sought a diversion from his troubles with the Victorian Labor Party <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made quite clear by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  when he visited the Territory in July last year, that the very plain policy of the Australian Government is to fall in with any requests that come from the Territory to give its people self-government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> when those people freely express their wish to have either stage of development; neither before that time, at the insistence of a militant minority, nor later, in accordance with the accusation that there is interest in Australia’s deferring those opportunities for the people of the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were appointed by the United Nations but we are trustees of the people of the Territory, for their advancement in a cultural and educational manner and their progressive development towards selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate was reminded by the impressive speech by  Senator McManus  of the prerequisites that most thinking people would require before <span class="highlight">independence</span> was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the  chairman  of the Select Committee on Constitutional Development made a report to the Parliament of New Guinea a few months ago to the effect that in the opinion of the Committee the majority of the peoples of Papua and New Guinea did not wish them to accept <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the House of Assembly affirmed that <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self government would be taken by the Territory only upon a resolution of representatives in that Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Australian Government, keeping constantly in consultation with those people, will make the decision that they request as to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self government according to the freely expressed wishes of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  the issue is whether or not this Senate is of the opinion that the policy of’ the Australian Government is correct in not imposing upon the people of the Territory self government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> contary to the freely expressed wishes of the people, and the Leader of the Opposition,  Senator Murphy  has invited us to give the Senate the opportunity of voting on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that the people of Papua and New Guinea should have right of entry to Australia runs counter to the Government’s objective of preparing the Territory for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traditionally universities have enjoyed <span class="highlight">independence</span> in internal matters and have been free from interference by outside bodies, lt is the maintenance of that unchallenged authority within internal matters that enables them to sustain that academic authority and that academic freedom which most people believe is a prerequisite of uninhibited pursuit of scholarship and research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that the University does not have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and autonomy that I believe it should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my observations I think it would add to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the University, its autonomy and its flexibility if this change were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel confident that no Australian government will seek to deny them their full and free <span class="highlight">independence</span> in carrying out their proper functions as universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we would meet the requirements of the Act and the needs of the University, and we would enhance its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, if we proceeded in the way in which I have suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the University is secured properly when each statute has to be approved by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may be wrong, but I think that it was probably because there was insufficient autonomy and insufficient <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would request the Minister to take up the matters which have been referred to, particularly the operation of these statutes and rules, to see whether, even if the Bill is passed, some consideration could be given to a better method of endeavouring to achieve what I think everyone has accepted should be achieved, that is, the preservation of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should be pleased if this matter could come within the attention of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which in turn might present it to the Treasury for consideration as to some way in which the difficulty can be overcome, consonant with the complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> of operation of arbitral and judicial bodies, and as to some way in which the prime Appropriation Bill might more accurately represent anticipated charges upon the national revenue in the year under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should perhaps reemphasise that if we have 100 members representing open electorates on a fair boundary distribution it will do more towards assisting the people to political <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the terms of being able to administer their own legislation and to look after their own affairs than this Bill even suggests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one were to set one’s face against the existence of the principle of the regional electorate and to abandon it or in some way qualify it unduly, this could only have the effect ultimately of impeding the movement towards complete <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is consistent with the emergence of a profession within the Territory which seeks an <span class="highlight">independence</span> and an autonomy as do the professions in the other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have noted in respect of some courts - I have no doubt that it applies here in the Australian Capital Territory - that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary is not as well respected as it might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other aspect which  Senator Murphy  mentioned was the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point which I wish to make with regard to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of judges is that the Government has always accepted that the judiciary is independent and that requests by the judiciary will, in general, always be respected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot unqualifiedly say, for reasons which I think would win ready acceptance, that any request by a judge for facilities should be accepted; but it is important to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of judges that they should feel and be secure in their tenure and enjoyment of office and in the availability of those facilities which enable them to discharge their duties properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We look at these problems as a government and say to ourselves: ‘In the present Australian context of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and with a tough world marketing scene, price and cost inflation are the problems with which the Government must grapple. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711124_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable senator stated the position substantially accurately when he referred to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its ability to express such views as appeal to it but which may not appeal to the Parliament or to parliamentarians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711125_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister, of course, is always in control of those proceedings and it should always be that way, because we ought to recognise that we have a Public Service which must be impartial and which must maintain its <span class="highlight">independence</span> to advise whoever happens to be the Minister, of whatever Party it might be from time to lime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One would say - and I say this from the viewpoint of the Attorney-General’s Department - that this is the desirable way in which legal aid .schemes should be developed because it preserves the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the legal profession and enables members of the profession the better to render the services which over the centuries they have been rendering, and at the same time it gives to every citizen the opportunity of legal advice and legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These excerpts might give an idea of the alternatives proposed as a  solution to this very difficult and very delicate question of finding a reconciliation between the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of operation of a public corporation and the right of Parliament to scrutinise its activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think there is a degree of inconsistency between what he said and the motion because, as 1 understand the language of the motion, it states that independent corporations should nol be able to rely on their <span class="highlight">independence</span> to exonerate themselves from answering to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Other statutory corporations established by the Parliament have an autonomy and an <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is found in the language of the statutes appointing them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The language differs from statute to statute, as does the autonomy and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of each corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, particularly following the High Court decision invalidating State receipts duties as they applied to certain types of transaction, it  was  clear that, notwithstanding these large increases in Commonwealth revenue assistance, it would be desirable for the States to have access to a new source of taxation to give them greater freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in revenue raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council for Aboriginal Affairs has indicated that for this goal to be achieved increasing emphasis must be given to measures to promote the greater economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Aboriginal Australians - as individuals, as groups and especially in the north and centre as communities, and to strengthen their capacity to manage their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, I repel the suggestions that the action taken in Queensland will denigrate in some sense the State and limit its sovereignty, although it may limit in some sense its economic and financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> by virtue of the fact that there will be some Commonwealth scrutiny of its financial and economic activities, but in no sense can I see that this will be other than for the benefit of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This gives some indication, surely, of the problem, In relation to the matter with which  Senator Byrne  dealt at length arising from the comments which were made by  Senator Milliner  as to the loss of <span class="highlight">independence</span> or sovereignty, let me assure  Senator Byrne,  for the reasons to which I have alluded in the course of my remarks, that, in fact, there is a substantial loss of sovereignty, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and ability of a government to carry out its promises to the electorate as part of the functions which it adopts These are definite and distinct losses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aim is, by needs and priorities, to destroy the flexibility and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our hope is that Papua New Guinea will advance in security and stability through the pre-<span class="highlight">independence</span> period and through all the years which follow <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The existence of a Commonwealth Teaching Service will enable the Commonwealth to provide teachers in Papua New Guinea until such time as that Territory achieves its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we hope that after Papua New Guinea has achieved its <span class="highlight">independence</span> this Commonwealth Teaching Service will be able, if the people of Papua New Guinea desire it, to assist in the establishment of their school system and their education department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that there are adequately trained people to administer the Territory which, within a few years at the longest, from whichever point of view one looks at it, Will be obtaining if not <span class="highlight">independence</span> at least self government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas a high quality teacher might not be willing to go to the insecurity of the Territories after they gain <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the existence of this Service and the fact that  a  teacher can be seconded gives the teacher the kind of security which will enable a high quality indeed to emerge inside Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition we have in the Bill recognition of our responsibilities, both present and anticipated to continue even after self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> have been attained by Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One thing  1  want to say about the Liberal Party of Australia is that although I have expressed myself in my own way over the years I have always been overwhelmingly re-endorsed by the people back home who want the Liberal Party to have an <span class="highlight">independence</span> of mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously the steps of the people of Papua New Guinea towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> will require development, and for development capital must be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most countries which had colonial territories under their control made mistakes, but my feeling is that even allowing for those mistakes, Australia has nothing to be ashamed of in what it has done to develop that Territory and to bring it to the threshhold of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over the years in which Australia has had control of the Territory of Papua New Guinea, the time limit on when that country should become independent and on when there should be a peaceful move towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> probably has been a significant question which has exercised the minds of Ministers in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because I knew that  Senator Murphy  was most anxious to be associated with  Mr Somare  on the day of the opening of the House, 1 asked the honourable senator to state his Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that the Pangu Party had said that it wished to see <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the Territory in a very short time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding, from being in Port Moresby the day after the House of Assembly opened, was that  Mr Somare  - I have not his words with me - made a comment along the lines that he did not want the Australian Government to press <span class="highlight">independence</span> on the Territory before the Territory was prepared for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today I was interested in what  Senator Murphy  was trying to say because for 6 months, or perhaps for less than 6 months,  Senator Murphy  and the Opposition have been attempting to force the Australian Administration into granting <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Territory on the demand of the Pangu Party or whoever may have been its leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do these words mean that these commissioners are to be deprived of any <span class="highlight">independence</span> and that in the new spirit of the Act, with the full court laying down guidelines in a wider and still wider field of activities, these commissioners are to become merely the tools of the presidential members and in effect are to be given their riding instructions in every matter allocated to them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister seen the statement made yesterday by Brigadier Eldridge, the retiring Joint Force Commander in Papua New Guinea, in which he called for the handing over of control of the armed forces before the granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Territory; if so, can the Minister inform the Senate whether the Government has determined any timetable for the handing over of control of the Territory’s armed forces to the Papua New Guinea authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-118-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There must also be an assertion of their own <span class="highlight">independence</span> and Australia must see to it that there is an encouragement of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought and creative thinking and, of course, an <span class="highlight">independence</span> of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The conclusion which may be drawn from that ‘AM’ broadcast and from  Senator Douglas  McClelland’s remarks is that the Labor Party should make up its mind whether it will follow the same broad line as the Government has followed of giving <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, whether it will follow the indicated Whitlam line that there will be some political control and direction of the ABC or whether it will follow the current line adopted by some of the ABC staff that they should be able to run the ABC without any control whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whilst I have applauded before, and I applaud again, the ideal of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the encouragement of thrift it is also very necessary that the economy be kept moving in the confident background of knowledge that we have the ability to spend money responsibly and still have savings on which to fall back if necessary or with which to buy those things that we have long term aspirations to obtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While I have expressed and still express some doubts whether Papua New Guinea is ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>, nevertheless we must face the fact that events make it inevitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easy and cheap to be critical but it is different when one has the responsibility - as these ministers have had - to try to guide the people in the Territory towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the changeover to <span class="highlight">independence</span> is smooth and the going remains smooth it will be because of the influence of these people who will deserve credit from the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should recognise this and see what we can do to ensure that they remain in the Territory to provide the expertise which will be so sorely needed to develop the Territory when it obtains <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it would be foolish of us to assume that <span class="highlight">independence</span> will solve all problems in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am making a few observations about the situation that Australia has to face at this historic moment of the transference to these people of their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self government so that they can resume, after a rude interruption, their own way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am certain that that attitude is the attitude of these people who are about to obtain their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are making an important contribution to this country because, without these men firstly, going in to assist the development and the education of this country and, secondly, taking a stake in it to develop it and get commercial viability in certain areas, this country would not be in the situation that it is in today - moving towards complete selfgovernment and eventual <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to underline the fact that you would like to subvert the Australian Government’s performance which has been marked by a permanent expression of hope that when the Territory asked for self-government and assumed the responsibilities of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Australia would have foreseen it, made the provisions that facilitated it and immediately acceded to it on a responsible resolution of the peoples themselves to accept that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A powerful body of mass media employees are setting their sights on a struggle, an intervention, aimed at weakening the bureaucratic grip on the ABC and carving out a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> hitherto unknown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - Honourable senators will recall that, during a statement to the Senate on 29th August outlining recent Government decisions on civil aviation policy, I said that, in the light of early self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, I proposed to visit Papua New Guinea to discuss a programme for the transfer of civil aviation responsibility to the local authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any objective assessment will reveal an historical background of a long struggle for Croatian <span class="highlight">independence</span> including a mutual hostility between Serbs and Croats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Much of his former <span class="highlight">independence</span> has abated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It brought together in that group Croatia which had had a long history of 1,200 years of seeking <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right from the beginning Croatia felt aggrieved, not only because it had lost its <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also because it believed that, from its own capital of Zagreb, it was being robbed of its financial resources and its treasure and that the money and treasure were being brought to Belgrade, the centre which was regarded as the Serbian centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That call to freedom was complicated and perverted by the fact that in 1941 Italy and Germany overran this tragic country again and then carved it up again into a group of countries, handing them out to the people around - giving a part to Bulgaria and so on, and giving to Croatia a form of <span class="highlight">independence</span> during those World War IT years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time there were 2 other groups of <span class="highlight">independence</span> fighters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If people who are standing for their principles and fighting against collectivists are handed over to bloody murder, if the tide of the Labor Party is in favour of the mass execution of hundreds of thousands of people whose only crime is that they believed in the independenceof their country, I will go on whistling against the wind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, in the same speech as I have quoted,  Dr Cairns  said that everybody was entitled to fight for the right of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, but not the Croatians because if they succeeded in gaining their <span class="highlight">independence</span> they would set up a fascist state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he said:  there’s nothing legitimate about the Croatians who want <span class="highlight">independence</span>, in fact identifying themselves with a fascist government - to put into that space where <span class="highlight">independence</span> would come would be no justification for a fascist government in Croatia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the second aspect of the question, what I said a little while ago - I think that is what he is referring to - is that I believe, from what 1 have been told, that a fear is held by those who are non-political or on the Left, so to speak, regarding extremists on the Right, and that a fear is held by those who may be inclined to favour Croatian <span class="highlight">independence</span> of what action may come from the Left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to matters like defence, economic policy, foreign relations, security issues, and what I call the trends of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the trends of national character, national opportunity and national aims and aspirations, and properly we should be talking, I think, along the lines that this is how we should approach this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the growing belief among senior staff members of the programme ‘This Day Tonight’ that the show will be axed after it goes into Christmas recess on 15th December, can the Minister approach the PostmasterGeneral to give a firm assurance that this popular and successful programme will not be killed off because its staff have tried to preserve their <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When T say that I speak not of interfering with the traditional <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the courts but in a sense that questions can properly be asked in this Parliament about matters that arise in the Court in the same way as questions are asked in State parliaments about matters associated with delays costs or procedures, because such matters properly come within the function of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be very unwise and very imprudent for a developing nation to wish immediately to embody within its <span class="highlight">independence</span> a group which will be different, a group which will not be homogeneous and which may well provide the seeds of dissent by being there reluctantly and being part of a new and developing nation although it is totally ethnically different and with a totally different background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe it would be tragic if this Senate were to adopt a motion such as the one which is before it tonight so that before Papua New Guinea obtained its <span class="highlight">independence</span> it would be faced with a declaration from the Australian people that we were adamant that we would not transfer these islands to Papua New Guinea even though they are only a few miles from the mainland of Papua New Guinea, even though they are part of the continental shelf surrounding Papua New Guinea, and recognised by international law as being the waters of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730228_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr Whitiam,  his wife and his daughter met the  President  of Indonesia the people outside were holding flags showing that they remembered that an Australian Labor Government, through the efforts of a fine jurist,  Sir Richard  Kirby, helped to forge <span class="highlight">independence</span> for that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To me that rate, of increase even for such a high office and an office of great <span class="highlight">independence</span> is altogether incommensurate with the circumstances to which I referred when protesting against the application of percentage increases to the high and low salary levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore we will have a tribunal which operates as an adviser to Parliament, a tribunal which will operate in restraint of the Parliament in case there is any element of self interest, and a tribunal which is established on the basis of permanent <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The HRB as an organisation is no longer a functioning entity in Australia, nevertheless, it may be assumed that some former members, and others of violent and revolutionary persuasion, would still be prepared to condone violence in pursuit of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our revolutionary struggle to achieve the Croatian People’s freedom and State <span class="highlight">independence</span> we shall use every possible means including, of course, chemicals in spile of the fact that some of them, e.g., poisons, are banned under international law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following discussions with the Papua New Guinea Government and the Minister for External Territories, it has been agreed that, pending <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea will join with Australia in joint exporter membership of the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the Papua New Guinea Government will need to consider the question of separate membership in the Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that indicates why, philosophically and intrinsically, the Liberal Party is superior to the Australian Labor Party which does not allow this freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of opinion which ought to be the hallmark of sophisticated, educated and intelligent legislators in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be carried only because the free vote which the Liberal Party allows and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of mind of some Liberal senators will ensure that it is carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who used to play the gentlemanly and noble game of Rugby League, I state that while this Government has a political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> policy for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, I will nonetheless bring my colleague’s representations to the notice of the Commission to see whether his request can receive favourable and sympathetic consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>On the one hand, if it suits Australia’s book, it suits the Commonwealth of Nations and the general Western democracies to hold the peace and possibly to subvert some Croatians who want <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we should strive for their economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to reduce existing social and other handicaps which face them in respect of health, housing, education and vocational training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Papua New Guinea should achieve <span class="highlight">independence</span> while any part of the loan is outstanding, Australia will use its best endeavours to ensure the continuing security of the loan and the smooth devolution of responsibility with respect thereto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could construe from that that Australia tended to be saying: ‘At <span class="highlight">independence</span> we will review the situation with regard to the guarantee’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any honourable senator on either side of the Senate would agree that Australia’s record in helping these people towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> and a state of economic responsibility has been very good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have encouraged moves by Papua New Guinea towards self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel however, that there is a little lack of clarity in some of the terms of what the currencies are to be, and what are the guarantee decisions which lie beyond a state of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement predicates the contemplated situation that when Papua New Guinea assumes political <span class="highlight">independence</span> a new relationship will develop between Australia and that country in which that country will e considered to be on its own and free from the solicitude, regard and attention that are now being devoted to it by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Papua New Guinea may well achieve political <span class="highlight">independence</span> very quickly, it will by -no means have achieved economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> or even complete economic viability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Government of this country should still contemplate the fact that, if Papua New Guinea in its present position of what we may call dependence receives guarantees from Australia for the Asian Development Bank to support its loan indebtedness, no vastly different position should be allowed to obtain merely with its emergence into <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not, a situation will be precipitated in which the nation will have political <span class="highlight">independence</span> and, if it is economicaly starved or finds itself economically inadequate, the real danger will arise there, as it has arisen in other countries - political <span class="highlight">independence</span> founders and finally sinks on the shoals of economic insufficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I think that the Government should at the earliest stage give some indication of its attitude from the point of view of financial and economic support to these Territories when they emerge into political <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, as I say, we will precipitate a situation in which a tremendous danger might be posed to the very political <span class="highlight">independence</span> which that country has sought for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Papua New Guinea is a country of considerable ethnic diversity, and any serious obstacles to communication will be a hindrance to the development of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true to say that we have a special responsibility as <span class="highlight">independence</span> approaches in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that after Papua New Guinea attains <span class="highlight">independence</span> Australia will assume with it an aid relationship which is similar to those which Australia has at present with other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know the exact detail of all those provisions, but 1 understand that financial matters after <span class="highlight">independence</span> are the subject of discussion and advice within the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After they came here her husband continued as a supporter of the Croatian Peasant Party and at all times they have been in favour of Croatian <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This would emphasise our <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The interesting point about that quotation is that as Leader of the Opposition the Prime Minister was very keen on asserting Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is probably because of our knowledge of the representation in the Northern Territory and from the progressive <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is being gained by the Legislative Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators on the Government side are objecting, but it is the wish of the Country Party and, I believe, of the Opposition in this place that greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> be granted to the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government adopts a policy of complete political programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Australian Broadcasting’ Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the intention would be quite clear - let there be no doubt about that - that we would think it quite inconsistent with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Australia that the United Kingdom Parliament would continue to have legislative authority over Australia or any part of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was used during the American War of <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, a branch of history which I am sure  Senator Webster  has not taken the trouble to study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was during the American War of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> that the word ‘terrorism’ was used, according to my recollection of my readings, about none other than George Washington and Thomas Jefferson who were accused of inciting terrorism in New York against the supporters of the British Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is not a matter relating to the merits of Michael Collins with which I would want to disagree with  Senator McManus,  but if  Senator McManus  can use the word ‘terrorist’ with regard to Michael Collins to indicate some praiseworthiness on his part, I would be interested to know what precisely it is that is objected to in the so-called terrorism of the organisations of the Vietnamese people struggling for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and unity of their country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are struggling in precisely the same way as Michael Collins and the Irish revolutionaries have been struggling for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and unity of their country for many centuries, and the same way as the people of the United States of America fought for their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and unity not only at the time of the War of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> but also at the time of the American Civil War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am very honoured to be associated with these delegates because they are people who fought for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of their country in the most distressing and appalling situation that one can imagine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they had got their justifiable reward - <span class="highlight">independence</span> for their countries - we would not have had these subsequent events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that this is happening by deception because under the guise, the socalled stance, of greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> we are moving out of the alliances and friendships that we have had with the democratic countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to maintain our <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and if we are to maintain our economic advancement, we need a sound international monetary system which essentially provides for a multilateral rather than a regional or bilateral approach to world financial arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The conception of political equality, from the Declaration of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, to the fifteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth amendments, can mean only one thing - one person one vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Commonwealth electoral officers of the various States, the surveyorsgeneral and departmental heads of that status and <span class="highlight">independence</span> over the decades have brought about a corruption, a gerrymander or a fraud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, where there is a shared responsibility under the Act, the Commissioner is given greater protection and greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> from external pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When 1 speak of Papua New Guinea having political, financial and economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> I do so in a theoretical sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Compatability, romantic love, a sense of freedom felt by those who are mutually accepting ties, and a sense of willingness to share the fortunes of life together are all factors which can and do impinge upon the minds and the actions of a younger generation which increasingly feels its greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> and its greater selfreliance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There does appear to be a greater self-reliance on and acceptance of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and a great facility, through governmental and social activities, for people to strike out on their own and to become completely independent of their parents, whether it be in the jobs they take or in the educational institutions in which they derive their learning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>iia it not an infringement of the Broadcasting” and Television Act for the Government tei: seek to intervene its political policies on programming upon a function for which the Act gives the Control Board complete, <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question refers to publicity given to the fact that the Australian delegation voted for a resolution calling for action to give <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Cocos Islands and that the Prime Minister, who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs, subsequently stated that Australia had no present intention to give <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Cocos Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, they will remove the power of the Minister for External Territories under section 30 to appoint officers and engage persons on contract for the Public Service, thus enabling Papua New Guinea to legislate to develop its own national public service - an essential authority for a country approaching full selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls the Authority to be given the <span class="highlight">independence</span> to decide for itself whether a pipeline shall be built on its assessment of what the needs for a particular area are and what is the likelihood of supplies in a particular area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our civil aid and defence policies will have a particular bearing on Australia’s future relationship with Papua New Guinea, whose <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be achieved, I confidently expect, in the closest consultation with the Government and House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea by 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are also anxious that outstanding questions relating to Papua New Guinea’s borders should be settled at an early date so that, when <span class="highlight">independence</span> is attained, Papua New Guinea’s relations with its near neighbours will not be plagued by the kind of territorial disputes which in other parts of the world have done so much to hinder the development of fruitful and mutually beneficial 1 clarions between close neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that despite my Government’s best endeavours early progress towards agreement on the border between Australia and Papua New Guinea seems unlikely and final agreement may have to await Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are so controlled by Caucus decisions that they have absolutely no <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought whatever in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Labor Government is advocating -  with as much <span class="highlight">independence</span> as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>National Airlines Commission, aerial work and charter operations, and operations in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is need to resolve any difference between the States and the Commonwealth as to the delimitation of any power which one claims and the other denies, the High Court, in its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, integrity and world status on the experience of the last 73 years, was established for that very purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there will be responsibility under the Act giving the Commission greater protection and greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> from external pressures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider that we are proposing to allocate tremendous resources to the growth centres which have been selected, I am sure honourable senators will appreciate that the Commission needs to have a great deal of <span class="highlight">independence</span> because of the pressures which will be exerted not only nationally but by State and local government bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His statement that the policy of the Liberal and Country Parties was backward represents an ideological stance which is quite intransigent because the evolution of the housing policies and the Commonwealth and State housing agreements over many years ultimately led to a change in the approach of the Commonwealth in  1971,  which meant a growing development of the housing policies in the States, ft gave rise to greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> and autonomy in the States in the type of housing policies they pursued and greater satisfaction of the needs of people who were looking for various types of housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators, more particularly those who have been connected with local government, will direct their remarks to the financial plight of local government authorities and the necessity for some measure of financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> for them and to the best method by which that <span class="highlight">independence</span> and financial viability can be established and maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we shall to that extent raise the status of the local government authority and give it new financial strength and greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> of action we must recognise also that in that process there will be necessarily by the sheer operation of the legislation a certain circumscription and truncation of the power and authority of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the States are to be placed permanently in the position of mendicants, whose sovereign <span class="highlight">independence</span> is a mere sham, it is imperative in their interests and in the interests of the people of Australia as a whole, that some way should be found under the Constitution to get rid of this want of balance, so as to make the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of State legislative and executive authorities a real thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inferences, as put forward by the Labor Party, are that this measure will herald a future in which local government will be strengthened at the grass roots and will have greater decentralisation, more real <span class="highlight">independence</span>, more substantial funds made available, direct to it as a whole and a better equity in the 3-tiered system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pause there to indicate that this is the socalled freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of local government in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>I draw my argument together by saying that certainly tocal government needs to have its status raised, to have more money available to  it  to carry out its work, to be strengthened in decentralisation and  to  be strengthened in its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation will restrict the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of local government and make access to the Grants Commission depend upon a ministerial decision from which there is no appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Negus  would know; he is so widely experienced and so inconsistent in his <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that the first 2 objectives, that is, the transferring of responsibility for the Public Service and the Auditor-General to the Papua New Guinea Administration and for making arrangements whereby the Australian personnel in the new Papua New Guinea Public Service may have their future provided for when <span class="highlight">independence</span> arrives, are matters which were determined upon and resolved by the previous Government before the present Government took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The nation is conscious of the fact that self government in and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea are being proceeded with expeditiously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In drawing attention to these matters I am not disputing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service Board or its experience, but simply relate these matters to the Bill which is the subject of consideration, particularly as the Public Service Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably slight amendments to the law are needed to give effect to that and to ensure that there is real <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate would be largely destroyed if this Bill were passed tying the terms of Territory senators to the life of the House of Representatives and, in my view, it would create second class senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal part of the Parliament is the Senate - the organ of the States, the visible representative of the continuity, <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and reserved autonomy of the States, linking them together as integral parts of the Federal union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see it as the thin edge of the wedge in the destruction of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would destroy completely the Senate’s present <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate was established to protect the State* and no compact would have been arrived at if the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and sovereignty of the States were not to be recognised and preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But unlike our Founding Fathers, who were concerned to establish the Senate as the Federal part of the Parliament - ‘the organ of the States, the visible representative of the continuity, <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and reserved autonomy of the States, linking them together as integral parts of the Federal Union’ - the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  leaves no doubt that, as one honourable member of another place expressed recently, he ‘is hell-bent on completely abolishing the States themselves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This scheme must be seen as the real threat that it is to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well, we would be endorsing the present Government’s plan to emasculate the Senate and destroy its status, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and continuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has already said that it will continue to honour existing financial guarantees to Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But does it also intend to assist the financial needs of Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span> by providing guarantees for new Papua New Guinea government borrowings on the Australian or overseas markets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is it a reflection upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the heads of the Commonwealth countries with whom he is associating but it is a slur upon- the Prime Minister and the Government of Great Britain, because there is absolutely no evidence to indicate that the control or domination to which he has referred is in existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question must be asked again: Where is all this aggressive show of <span class="highlight">independence</span> leading us? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ASEAN governments have been discussing proposals for a ‘zone of peace, freedom and neutrality’ in South East Asia that would preserve their security and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and allow them to pursue their national and regional development free from disruption by military confrontation in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Five years ago, although the government was communist, that government was attacked on the ground that it sought some small degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the demands of the Soviet Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the virtual <span class="highlight">independence</span> and immunity of public corporations is so important that we should predicate it at every opportunity, and this is one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That would be news to a lot of people-  and will continue to advocate, measures which would, under international supervision, assure a ban on nuclear arms and their manufacture as well as the destruction of existing stockpiles, France is pursuing her policy of defence; given the present state of world armaments, the development of a nuclear armament is essential for French security and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was with some of these people at a Sunday church service and when I returned to their homes I found that they were talking about how long before it would be before France would give them <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the greatly increased involvement of the Government in all matters pertaining to the media and the dangers inherent in any possible over-participation, and in view of the call by the Australian Broadcasting Commission for changes to the Broadcasting and Television Act in order to strengthen its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, does the Government intend taking such action as would ensure the greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> sought by the Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, shortly after I assumed this office I had discussions with the then  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission,  Sir Robert  Madgwick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I told him that it was Government policy to guarantee the political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area which might interest the honourable senator so far as the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission is concerned is section 16 (3) of the existing Broadcasting and Television Act which enables the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to determine the transmission hours not only of commercial broadcasting and television stations but of all broadcasting and television stations, and that naturally includes the ABC stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This rather impedes the Commission in its complete <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> of policy and action had been traded away for ‘defence on the cheap’- yet its closest allies, the United Kingdom and the U.S., were withdrawing into low profiles’ on the understandable premise that their friends should be as ready to defend their own freedom as we had been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be most unusual for one sovereign government to guarantee the external borrowings of another sovereign government but this matter will be considered when the detailed arrangements for <span class="highlight">independence</span> are drawn up after Papua New Guinea becomes self-governing later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As stated by the honourable senator, the Australian Government will continue in the post <span class="highlight">independence</span> period to honour the guarantees we will have provided for borrowings entered into by the Papua New Guinea Government before that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comparable amount at <span class="highlight">independence</span> will almost certainly be greater than this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-59-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the formal achievement of selfgovernment nor <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be marked by an abrupt step or a dramatic change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This broadening of its authority reflects current practice agreed by the previous government and this government that when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes there will be no area of government in which Papua New Guinea will be unfamiliar or lack experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By agreement with Papua New Guinea, defence and foreign relations will remain reserved to Australia until <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The creation of this portfolio and the appointment to it of a Papua New Guinea Minister will ensure that Papua New Guinea will have first hand involvement and experience in these key reserved areas, well before <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 31 of the Bill makes clear that this guarantee will continue for the life of those loans which are raised before <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills, the adoption of the Constitution, subsequent amendment of the Papua New Guinea Act next year, and the final step of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, are all integral stages in the continuous development of Papua New Guinea from dependency to nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the timing of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the Council noted Australia’s view that there are 2 elements involved in the determination of the question of <span class="highlight">independence</span>: The view of Australia, and the views of the people of Papua New Guinea as expressed through their elected representatives in the House of Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council noted that Australia expects <span class="highlight">independence</span> to come by 1975, and that it should be achieved in the closest consultation with the Government and the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 asked Australia to fix a timetable for <span class="highlight">independence</span> in consultation with Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New Guinea should experience a period of selfgovernment before a date for <span class="highlight">independence</span> is set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to remedy this situation, and to permit moderately frail people to continue to live with some measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, that the previous Government introduced this personal care subsidy in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest fear of the aged is that of being incapable of just doing things for themselves, and the loss of their cherished <span class="highlight">independence</span> rapidly erodes the dignity of their life style; a dignity which should be fostered by the community and not destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, then, any move that is going to enable the handicapped to achieve some measure of economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> is going to be in the interests not only of the handicapped people themselves but also of the whole community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transfer of such responsibilities in this important area is essential for a country shortly to achieve self-government and moving towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be discourteous of the Opposition just to agree to this legislation without any comment because new conditions will result from the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self government of Papua New Guinea which we all have watched with interest and have been involved in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we would all agree with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  when he said in his second reading speech that the transfer of such responsibilities is important for a country which is shortly to achieve self government and which will shortly have a state of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, this new country, which is being given self government and which is to be granted <span class="highlight">independence</span> later, will have its own banking system- a reserve bank and a commercial bank, both backed up by Australian expertise and, in some cases, finance, understanding and knowhow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore passing through a stage, really, of potential <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that there are those of us who believe that the state of <span class="highlight">independence</span> may be coming on more quickly than the people of New Guinea necessarily desire or is necessarily wise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no Australian would want other than that Papua New Guinea should progress to <span class="highlight">independence</span> as fast as is desirable and sensible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One looks to the country’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> as something which they want and which is both wise and sensible from our point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of <span class="highlight">independence</span> there is a consquential change in the title of the Administrator of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes there will be no area of government in which Papua New Guinea will be unfamiliar or lack experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have great doubt that one can achieve the experience and total familiarity with all the things one needs to do as a new government in a state of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in such a short span of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people of that country are unfamiliar with their new state of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, or if it proves that they have not got all the experience they can draw upon our help because we have been with them for a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defence and foreign relations remain reserved to Australia until <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be necessary areas to reserve pending completion of legislative arrangements, but we would be working towards giving them a state of full authority and control at the point of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will pass off with <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will take up the areas of increased responsibility which will pass over with <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 3 1 of the Bill makes it clear that this guarantee will continue for the life of the those loans which are raised before <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final step of <span class="highlight">independence</span> is the integral stage in the continuous development of Papua New Guinea from dependency to nationhood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council noted that Australia expected <span class="highlight">independence</span> to come by 197 S and that it should be achieved by the closest possible consultation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it gives every promise that <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be accompanied by tremendous successes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that it is a matter for tremendous pride that in that time, with those setbacks, we created a nation of our own, one of the wealthiest nations of its size in the world and in the process helped to establish the nation of Papua New Guinea to which <span class="highlight">independence</span> is now coming with the aid and support that we have been able to give it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great change which will occur and about which I wish to say something later in my remarks will occur, of course, on the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hoping that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  who is in charge of the Bills might be able to indicate definitely what will be the ambit of the control of internal security because naturally this is one of the major questions that arises in the transference of selfgovernment, even prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First and foremost, concern was expressed to us over and over again about <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament level or at the level of the new emerging leaders of the Public Service in Port Moresby- at the prospects of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying that it is not our obligation to endeavour to hasten along the processes of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, but I think it is my duty to express in the national Parliament, having had this opportunity to visit Papua New Guinea, the concern that so many people there feel about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we as a delegation, speaking on behalf of this Parliament and on a non-party basis, were able to give adequate reassurance to these people and to others at a higher level to whom we spoke, that financial support would certainly continue for the new nation, not only after selfgovernment but also after <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and that this would be financial support at a level which it has enjoyed in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are very concerned that after selfgovernment, and certainly after <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Australia may wipe its hands of their nation and that no Australians, or very few, will remain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other question that I wanted to comment upon is what we might call the road to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guinea but also in Australia, among those who take an interest in Papua New Guinea as to what is the Australian Government’s policy in relation to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said before the elections that it was the policy of his Party that there should be <span class="highlight">independence</span> within the life of the present Parliament, so 1975 was a date that was in many people’s minds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Government came into power the Minister for External Territories started to talk about <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who were concerned about the possibility of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as early as 1975 have been not only further alarmed but also thoroughly confused by statements of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as a Party have taken the view that <span class="highlight">independence</span> should not be thrust upon Papua New Guinea, that there should be a request to us by a representative body of Papua New Guinea which says: ‘We are now ready for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The big problem will be to resolve the concern and doubts that so many Papuans and New Guineans have about <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only is there concern about <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also a number of local movements, even secessionist movements, are starting to arise in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should not be made by the leaders of the Public Service or the intellectuals in Port Moresby who are wanting to race ahead in obtaining <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should not be made even by the leading members of the Government who may be more anxious than many others to get early <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it will want to treat this matter of <span class="highlight">independence</span> with care and caution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the last thing they want is an Australian Government ramming <span class="highlight">independence</span> down their necks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another problem from which I think we cannot run away is that of local <span class="highlight">independence</span> movements or local decentralisation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Press loves to blow these things up and to make out that Miss Josephine Abaijah and her Papuan <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement want to have a separate state and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot just throw <span class="highlight">independence</span> at Papua New Guinea before these matters are resolved in some way or other because if we do we will only be leaving the country with a Government which will then be racked by internal civil war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in this period between self government and <span class="highlight">independence</span> we have to ensure that there is some reconciliation of these differences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there will have to be many more of this sort of development before Papua New Guinea is fully fit for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because after 1 December we as a national parliament will still have responsibility for Papua New Guinea’s foreign affairs and defence and, I think, for a general oversight of the affairs of that nation, we ourselves will have to shoulder some considerable responsibility in determining this vital question of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to add my dissident voice to the rush towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I first took an interest in Papua New Guinea I was of the opinion that it needed its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, but the more I studied the country and the more I went up there the more I realised that it was not yet time for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to say that we have to give <span class="highlight">independence</span> to Papua New Guinea as fast as possible, but when one looks around the country one can see that the people are not ready for it and many do not want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who really want <span class="highlight">independence</span>, of course, are the university trained people, the elitist group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want us to rush into giving <span class="highlight">independence</span> to Papua New Guinea because they will be the heads of government in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to say to them: ‘Now you are ready for self government’, but one has only to visit the country to see that there are so many separatist movements that it is obvious that after <span class="highlight">independence</span> is attained the country will be ruled by the army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bougainvillians despising the Tolais and the Papuans hating the Highlanders and all New Guineans in toto, there is no doubt in my mind that there will be a blood bath following <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other problem is that once Papua New Guinea attains <span class="highlight">independence</span> it will be a greater financial burden around our necks than it has been in the past because if we do not give assistance to that country the Japanese will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giving Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">independence</span> does not seem to me to be the answer, but it seems the ‘in’ thing nowadays is that every nation must have its <span class="highlight">independence</span> whether or not it is ready, and it seems that we have to assist Papua New Guinea towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have failed the people of Papua New Guinea in education and in medicine, and I think we are going to fail them altogether when we hand over <span class="highlight">independence</span> to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I acknowledge the Minister’s possible difficulties in this area, we would like to know whether there will be any form of oath or affirmation of allegiance which it is contemplated will be adopted by Papua New Guinea when it secures <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We appreciate that if the Territory of Papua New Guinea, approaching <span class="highlight">independence</span>, wishes to change the form of the oath, we will accord with its wishes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interest which we have at the present time, before <span class="highlight">independence</span> has arrived, is whether there is intended to be any form of allegiance whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no suggestion from this Parliament that after Papua New Guinea ‘s <span class="highlight">independence</span> we will have the slightest control of or influence on this new independency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incursion and extraction’ are military terms being used to describe an exercise to take place in Papua New Guinea next February in which the elite of the Australian Army, the Special Air Service Regiment  (SASR),  will put the final touches on a contingency plan drawn up in case of trouble in the post <span class="highlight">independence</span> era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political <span class="highlight">independence</span> of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries free from threats or acts of force; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Karmel Committee also emphasised the need for greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> within the government school system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary that, far from centralising education, in the interests of diversity and in the interests of innovation we should be able to have a greater degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> within those education systems which exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously one of the difficulties which is presenting itself to honourable senators is the fact that if a joint sitting of both Houses were held in some way the Senate may submerge its dignity lose its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and, in the vote that is subsequently taken, be overwhelmed by the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the suggestion in the latter part of his question, I must point out to the honourable senator that it is the policy of this Government to guarantee the political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Ryde, Sydney, along with many other schools which are still suffering, there is a school called the Australian International <span class="highlight">Independence</span> School. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I am no admirer of the Melbourne ‘Age’, at least the editor of that newspaper had the integrity to say that he would not go because it might compromise his <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under this Government in 10 or 1 1 months we have lost every shred of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in our foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To grant the mainland Territories representation in the Senate is seen by the Australian Country Party as the thin edge of the wedge in the destruction of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and perhaps of the Senate itself in the long run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that they do not want any meddling with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate or any threat to its continued existence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 put in a dissenting report in which I put forward views in which the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate was maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will move that amendment because I think that this Schools Commission- we supported the Commission and voted for the second reading of the Bill, as my Party has supported every progressive move that has been brought forward in respect of education in this Senate and in this Parliament- ought to have a reasonable degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and for the life of me I cannot understand how the claim can be made that a commission, every member of which is appointed by the Government, will be an independent commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the people who are to be on this Commission are all to be appointed by the Government and to be reappointed by the Government there cannot be any <span class="highlight">independence</span> about this Commission because, as everybody knows, governments tend to appoint people who will play ball. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is that not an attack on their <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The view has been taken that, in view of the steps being taken by Papua New Guinea towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>, it will properly be a matter for that country to make a decision on accession to the Covenant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the view has been taken that, in view of the steps being taken by Papua New Guinea towards <span class="highlight">independence</span>, it will probably be a matter for that country to make a decision on accession to the Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Unilateral Declaration of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> has been in existence in Rhodesia about 8 years now and the Government is still referred to by the Attorney-General and members of his Government as an illegal regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From what I see of the interest in this legislation, I think that it was entirely appropriate to expect each of the 7 parliaments of the country to adopt an identical piece of legislation bespeaking, of course, not the slightest <span class="highlight">independence</span> or initiative of thinking on the part of any one of the parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Dr Cairns issued a declaration of financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He added that a future State government will always be in doubt as to the extent to which this encroaching Commonwealth power, particularly in Federal-State financial relations, will permit a State Treasurer to have any degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it has always been my understanding that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Tariff Board is based upon the security of tenure of its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the situation is reached where only the nucleus of a committee or a board of reference has security of tenure, and there are two persons sitting on each side of him- one may be in a particular section of the industry under reference and the other in a different interest, sectional withal in the same industry- the Government may be creating the shifting sands of subversion of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the opinion that the  Chairman  of the Commission is an office of such absolute <span class="highlight">independence</span> that he should be absolutely precluded from holding any interest in any business whatever in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there is any commission in this country, next to the Auditor-General, which should be assured of complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> of pecuniary commercial interest it is this Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no field in which it is more imperative to have absolute <span class="highlight">independence</span> of pecuniary interest than in a Commission providing pecuniary assistance to industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister also indicate to the ABC Commissioners that the ABC charter of freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> requires that it display balance and objectivity in its news reports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Broadcasting Commission under this Government has been told that it has complete political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has insisted that it carry out its political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is <span class="highlight">independence</span> in that sense a virtue only if the Commission achieves objectivity and balance in its reporting and programming? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not an undermining of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary because, in strictness, he was not a judicial officer, he was a non-judicial officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are not dealing with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this because of the red herring of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary which has been dragged in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from what he alleges to be an attack seeking to undermine the judiciary, the purpose of what I have said and what  Senator Wright  has said has been to establish, and to have maintained, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, recognition that the ability to work and to be self-supporting is absolutely crucial to adult <span class="highlight">independence</span>, to happiness, and to self-respect, and to gaining the respect of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he again remind the Commissioners of the ABC that their charter of freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> requires them to maintain objectivity and carries an obligation to give both sides in the controversy a fair go? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a most important Bill because it could affect, firstly, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and, secondly, its existence as a House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a fortnight ago, when this house was debating the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill, I drew attention to the fact that the provisions of that Bill represented the thin edge of the wedge in the destruction of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate, and perhaps of the Senate itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great strength and the great value of the Senate is its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and the Constitution, as it now stands, gives it that <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Between 1949 and 1959 we had only the slightest indications of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As one who has always stood for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this chamber, I think that I should say a few words in connection with this Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the very nature of a commission is to give to some statutory body an <span class="highlight">independence</span> of ministerial control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that attitude develops then one strikes right at the outset at one of those characteristics of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which all barristers ought to assume and ought to have in the conduct of their clients’ business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that this request, which has demonstrably and clearly occurred in Melbourne, is striking at that <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government will meet the full cost of the treatment of patients without charge in those charitable and religious hospitals which wish to accept such patients, and will do so without any infringement of the autonomy and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of these hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At a time when profound changes are taking place in the patterns of international relations, it is particularly important that the role of small and medium powers should be understood and appreciated, and that they should seize the opportunities for greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> … <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context, China’s support for the principles of respect for the national sovereignty, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and territorial integrity of all states can make a significant contribution to strengthening peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without this amendment, during the period between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, Papua New Guinea boats would continue to be subject to Australian jurisdiction while in Australian proclaimed waters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate in the last few years has given real meaning to the parliamentary system and I say that in this role the Senate now continues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party members of a committee cannot be swayed by logic or by the facts, so what can be expected from people who have no <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought, who can only mouth the collective decision like a group of robots and who have a conscience only when Caucus permits it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that the status of the Senate and its committees was lifted by Liberal and Country Party senators and others on the Opposition side now who, with their <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought, were able to seek out information and listen objectively to those presenting evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, any attempt to destroy the Senate’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> as a chamber, or any attempt that may appear to do that, should and must be closely examined for the good of the parliament and the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see it as an attempt to downgrade the Senate and to weaken its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate ‘s great strength and value lies in its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That difference was established so that there would be a continuity of membership in the Senate as well as from the length of the term, a strength in engendering an <span class="highlight">independence</span> of outlook on the part of senators not necessarily echoing their own Party members or the other House in matters that came before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that thought will be given to whether there should be a Senate, whether there should be a Senate of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, now that <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be maintained and whether the Senate is to be looked upon simply as an echo of the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only because there were spirits of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the government parties who were prepared not to echo the Government at every stage but also because there grew up on election by the people minority parties and independent senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest it is dangerous because it will mean that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and therefore its ability to play its proper role in a 2- chamber system will be impaired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To tie the Senate to the House of Representatives in the manner proposed by this Bill tends to make it a replica and would therefore tend to weaken its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the question would then arise- which in the case of the Government at the present time might have its problems- as to what <span class="highlight">independence</span> there would be among senators to indicate that the Senate would perform the watchdog role which, I remind Labor Party senators, they urged for the Senate when they were in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that it would be difficult for the Labor Party senators to fulfil that role in government because the Caucus system and the iron discipline which the party system imposes on the Labor Party would tend to prevent that <span class="highlight">independence</span> from developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I say that there is a problem about maintaining the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate, the watchdog role of the Senate, the essentially independent review role of the Senate if the Labor Party has the numbers in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third reason why it would be dangerous to accept this proposal is that the removal of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and the reduction of its effectiveness would have the tendency to make the Senate redundant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is getting into the realms of speculation, but all I am saying is that once the Senate’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> has been reduced the tendency would be to make the Senate appear redundant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are constantly concerned about the lack of money to do the things that they want to do, but, my word, if they were told that what they must do is governed and directed from Canberra, they would prefer their autonomy, their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the ability to make their complaints about the lack of money rather than to take the money and have to do what a bureaucrat, who has never been to Camberwell, thinks is right for that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be prepared to fight to maintain its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Maybe we would not be sounding the death knell of bodies which administer local areas but we would be sounding the death knell of local bodies which have autonomy, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the ability to make their decisions for their own people and for their own areas and that, believe me, is what people in this country are crying out to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would imagine that if Papua New Guinea is to exercise a power over fisheries it will do so either because of a delegation of power under the existing Fisheries Act or by virtue of the Papua New Guinea (Application of Laws) Act which was passed by this Parliament last year as part of the steps by which we granted self government as a preliminary to the granting of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, discussions between officials of both governments are now taking place to reach an agreement on the question of the border between Australia and Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government’s support of the right to <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the people of Namibia, will the Government protest at the South African Government’s arrest and detention of these people without charge? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the directly opposite view that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary would be greatly strengthened if there were only a qualified right of appointment by the government which is responsible for the administration of legislation under review or if the court owed its existence to authority quite outside that government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the past this country gave encouragement and incentive to oil companies in so many ways to explore and so gave assistance in the saving of overseas expenditure and in the obtaining of some <span class="highlight">independence</span> with regard to our energy needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have taken a stand of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be wanting in my duty if I did not refer to the fact that judges who accept executive office or the position of being publicly designated for executive office cease thereafter to enjoy that degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is absolutely inalienable from judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to be quite impossible for a judge who has been designated as a Governor of a State or the Governor-General, thereafter to have that <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the executive and of the government that is essential to the discharge of judicial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reality if one wants <span class="highlight">independence</span> in these spheres, the judges are more protected by the constitutional provisions than is a Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the Governor-General, one would think that it is better to have provisions relating to a pension which would provide this measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It follows that the Senate has retained its <span class="highlight">independence</span> because it is a chamber where no single party has a majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">independence</span> has served this chamber well over the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at any time the people believed that there were incipient signs of such development, and if the accusation was made, fortunately we had in this community a spirit of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and willingness to criticise which ensured that what was incipient did not become permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until there is an <span class="highlight">independence</span> and willingness to apply objectivity and to make an independent judgment designed to give expression to what a free Press has always stood for, we will have these stories which are nothing more than handouts to lazy journalists who are not prepared to do their own work and to write their own stories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would think that the great bulk of those films result from investment by the Australian Film Development Corporation, which is responsible to me ministerially but which has <span class="highlight">independence</span> under the statute and which makes investments in films considered by that Corporation to be commercially viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that it would be far better for the honourable senator, if this is to be the level of his <span class="highlight">independence</span>, to formalise the matter, take out an application and join the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Alliance, the Liberal-Country League or the National Liberal Party or whatever may be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My goodness, they were very articulate when they urged Papua New Guinea on to a state of nationhood and <span class="highlight">independence</span>- very much so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Unlike our founding fathers who were concerned to establish the Senate as the Federal part of the Parliament- ‘the organ of the States, the visible representative of the continuity, <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and reserved autonomy of the States, linking them together as integral parts of the Federal Union’- the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam leaves no doubt that, as one honourable member of another place expressed recently, he ‘is hell-bent on completely abolishing the States themselves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As well, we would be endorsing the present Government’s plan to emasculate the Senate and destroy its status, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and continuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable senator knows, under this Government the ABC is guaranteed political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the Commission has advised me that whilst it would be most willing to transmit a direct telecast of the game to the areas to which the honourable senator has referred, apparently it was a decision of the Australian Rugby League that the 3 tests were not to be directly telecast but that films of the game could be shown after the game had finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, those blithe spirits of Queensland who have shown a proper degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of spirit and a proper understanding of Statehood and decentralisation would, in old-fashioned Queensland language, have breached the protocol and told  Mr Whitlam  and his Government exactly what they thought of this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I at once put my point of view, as I did in my written submission, saying that a judge adds nothing to the judicial <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a tribunal unless he acts as a judge, and the first thing that he is bound to do is to operate in public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a strong view, with which the Australian Government of course agrees, that in accordance with the Security Council resolution the sovereignty, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and territorial integrity of Cyprus be maintained and that the situation revert certainly to what it was before hostilities commenced, if not to a better position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it seems extraordinary that a matter of such domestic concern to Australia may be taken away to be decided by a set of judges who are not appointed by us, not responsible to us and acting in a way which is quite inconsistent with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Australia and its present standing in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister now say that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC as a statutory corporation absolves him as the responsible Minister from any responsibility for balance and fairness in ABC programming? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Or would he not agree that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is justifiable only if it produces objectivity of judgment and balanced programming? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By the time the vital votes on this Bill are taken it will be apparent, in view of the expressed attitude of the Liberal-Country Party Opposition to the Bill, whether party political ideology purportedly masked under the guise of self-professed <span class="highlight">independence</span> will prevail or whether the interests of all Australians as consumers will be safeguarded by a joinder of certain forces with the Government to destroy the reactionary and conservative opposition to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation inform the Senate about arrangements for the provision of repatriation benefits for Australian ex-servicemen and their dependants who will continue to reside in Papua New Guinea after <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Upon the attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Papua New Guinea there will be no difference in the situation of people who fall into those categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If nothing were to be done about this matter, upon the attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Papua New Guinea a number of people who are at present living there would lose that benefit because Papua New Guinea would cease to be a Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the Government recently considered the matter and decided that any person who received these latter benefits and who was living in Papua New Guinea at the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> would be deemed to continue to be a resident of Australia or of one of its Territories and would continue to receive the benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, if somebody was not a resident of Papua New Guinea at the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and subsequently went to live there, he would fall into the same category as persons who have moved out of Australia and its Territories to a foreign country and would not be in receipt of the latter type of benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, the policies of the Australian Government in respect of Aboriginal people might be described as seeking: to encourage and strengthen the capacity of Aborigines to manage their own affairs and to increase their economic <span class="highlight">independence</span>; to enable Aborigines to have a real freedom of choice about their life style and the extent to which, particularly in the more remote communities, they maintain their traditional customs and culture- a freedom which can be exercised to the extent that communities have local authority, in particular through land ownership; to make equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians by working to overcome those handicaps which generally face them in fields such as housing, health, education, employment and civil liberties; in doing this, to help Aborigines themselves to provide services designed to overcome handicapsfor instance, through Aboriginal housing societies, medical services and legal services- and to act in the closest consultation with Aboriginal communities and individuals at both the national and the local levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have dropped out of the system as soon as they possibly could because naturally they want to assert their own political <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of contractual guarantees by the Australian Government for overseas borrowings by the Papua New Guinea Government in foreign currencies not exceeding the equivalent of $A20m prior to achievement of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that arrangements for the borrowings for which this Bill provides contractual guarantees will be concluded prior to the achievement of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Papua New <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Retention of eligibility for repatriation benefits which are available only to residents in Australia and its Territories will be proposed in respect of Australian veterans and their dependants who are resident in Papua New Guinea prior to that country gaining <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and who continue to reside there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government proposes to allow persons resident in Papua New Guinea prior to that country gaining its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and who continue to reside there after <span class="highlight">independence</span>, to be then considered still resident in Australia or its Territories for repatriation purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seeks to promote- and I think this is justified- the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which a wife will have so that she will not forever be in a position of dependence, of self-commiseration, and will be able wherever possible to take her place in the world after divorce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I may sound as though I am talking at a level which is not in keeping with a very modern attitude towards the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of people, even within the marriage set-up, but fundamental to our society through the ages has been the principle that the husband is responsible for the wellbeing of his wife and his children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may interest honourable senators who have not studied the Bill- if there are any- to know that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea is acknowledged and the effect on ex-servicemen resident in that emerging country is covered by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that we are now encouraging more people to enter sheltered workshop employment and that we will eliminate the disincentive effect that supplementary assistance has had on earnings is of advantage to those people who can seek a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in a sheltered workshop situation without feeling that they jeopardise other support which may be basic to their needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A separate agency has an advantage in that it will undoubtedly enable the appointed director-general to have greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> of action, and the professional staff which will be attached to him to have wider career and personal opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741030_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Tribunal, of course, will act according to law and act with the proper <span class="highlight">independence</span>, impartiality and integrity which one expects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Weaken respect for marriage, regard it as easily and opportunistically dissolvable, remove the lawful backing for the mutuality of obligations and promote the <span class="highlight">independence</span> or separateness of the parties to the marriage and their children and I believe that we are threatening the institution of the family and its stabilising influence in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that by stressing the necessity for a divorced wife to go out and earn her own living without being able to look to any support from her spouse who has deserted her we are emphasising a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and separateness which is not in the interests of the marriage contract. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, it adds a connection between the judiciary and the executive which I think is always fraught with problems because the power of the executive over the judiciary strikes at the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would enable them to live in their own homes and to have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> they want for as long as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In particular, the purpose here is to assist Papua New Guinea with its development and to assist and encourage Australian private investment in Papua New Guinea after that country gets its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator would know, it is the Government’s policy to guarantee political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Government has always been expressing very strongly the view that there is complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> in programming and in content by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Tasmania’s so-called independent senator asserts itself this afternoon in a manner which has not been very noticeable in recent months, it seems that this Bill is probably doomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether it is right that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary should be dissipated in this way and whether there is any way in which he can take action to ensure that the Premier of Queensland causes an immediate announcement to be made that a District Court judgeship will not be used as a political reward? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in line with Australia’s policy of ensuring that Papua New Guinea exercises final responsibility in all matters of government before assuming full <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exercise of responsibility by the Government of Papua New Guinea in the areas of defence and foreign relations until formal <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be subject to Australia’s treaty obligations and responsibilities in international law and to the United Nations under the Charter and the Trusteeship Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, Australian policy is to enable Papua New Guinea to exercise authority in all matters of government before the formal step to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and these amendments are designed to give effect to this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which it will rely on State environment authorities will depend on the confidence it has in those authorities, on its judgment of their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and on the significance of the proposals from the national viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise that this must place in question the commencing date of the Government’s national health scheme, but we can understand the attitude of the health funds because to have accepted the agency requirements of the Government would have been to place at risk the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the health funds and the way in which they have functioned as bodies for voluntary contributions and benefits which have been developed from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has consistently supported the British Government’s Five Principles as the basis for a constitutional settlement in Rhodesia, especially the fifth principle that any basis proposed for <span class="highlight">independence</span> must be acceptable to the black majority of Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are delighted to see that this small measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be left to a pensioner patient in a nursing home for private expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to the Charter of the United Nations, the BalticStates are entitled to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and their people to selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it should be said that these Bills are being treated with a contumely both by the House of Representatives and by the Senate which belies the importance which they have to the future of Papua New Guinea and does little to acknowledge the contribution which Australia has made towards the development of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in that Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said that when in due course <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes to New Guinea then in some way, undefined, unspecified and with no indication as to what the future holds, the defence of that area will be Australia’s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being given absolutely no information by this Government, and yet it must be apparent that at some time in the early or middle part of 1 975 it is to be expected that complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea will be asserted by that country and accepted by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament of Australia needs better, deserves better than what has been done, and I believe that in the final discharge of our obligations to the people of Papua New Guinea under the trusteeship agreement we ourselves should do something about ensuring that their <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be a real and guaranteed <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter to which I refer relates to the boundaries of Papua New Guinea when it secures its complete <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution is ignored and the rights of the people of Queensland, the rights of the people of Papua New Guinea and the rights of the Torres Strait Islanders are just not taken account of in the assertions that our present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  makes about what should be the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate that the Opposition supports these Bills because they must be supported, and we do it willingly, but I indicate also that there are gaps in what should be Australia’s attitude to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and the laughter of the Government senators I think is a fair commentary on their general attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure whether in the space of some 20 years to 25 years the rule of law has been grounded in Papua New Guinea in a way in which it will survive <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only proper that, when <span class="highlight">independence</span> comes, we should evolve a system under which the judges whom Australia has appointed to the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea should be protected in their pension rights and in their futures if they decide to leave Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know that he has been a man of integrity, steadfastness and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-100-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator of course will appreciate that the Government has the policy of political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but I certainly believe that matters of the nature to which  Senator Mulvihill  has referred have to be watched very closely by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that the Papua New Guinea Government has announced that one of the responsibilities of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force after <span class="highlight">independence</span> will be ‘to be able to assist the police in the maintenance of public order and security as a last resort if the police cannot reasonably be expected to cope. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly will not have the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and authoritative status under, as I have said, a very forceful and independent  chairman  which we were led to believe would be the case when the Government originally announced the policy it would follow in reconstructing Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple situation is that if this Bill is left as it is the Commission, knowing that the Minister always will be able to stand over it, will have no <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course that gives the lie to any suggestion that this is a commission which might have any <span class="highlight">independence</span> or freedom of viewpoint, and certainly any reflection of the viewpoint of the people of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, whatever has been done by this Government in regard to other statutory authorities, it is our view that this Commission should have the same sort of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as the National Airlines Commission, the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission and a number of other commissions which have been established by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely strong opposition should be offered because if we are to attract as General Manager a person of considerable ability and standing in his profession to carry out the enormous task which he will have to do he must be assured of some <span class="highlight">independence</span> of position, especially since the Commission has developed into a political committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, I think that we should do all we possibly can to preserve the Senate as it is at present, and that the Senate should retain its <span class="highlight">independence</span> in not going to election always with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it to rob the Senate of its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the parliamentary system of its meaning? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would emphasise our <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Prime Minister is doing is following the course which is contrary to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which we in the Opposition Parties regard Australia as possessing and which we feel it should uphold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It indicates a desire to cling to the coat tails of a country from which we claim to have achieved <span class="highlight">independence</span> many  years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention that because it ought to put an end to the constant allegatons which the Labor Party makes that the Opposition parties want to preserve this appeal and really are not concerned to maintain Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the project which the Minister discussed this morning, I question whether the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC will be upheld in its co-operation with Film Australia, which will be making films subject to the approval and direction of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> is a word which deserves a more respectable application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A war of <span class="highlight">independence</span> became a war of massive foreign intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, the whole thrust of the Government’s policies on housing has been to provide rental housing- not to increase the rate of home ownership but to make people more dependent on paying out money to government agencies, without in any way giving them the hope or prospect of real <span class="highlight">independence</span> in this very basic security that I believe most Australians want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a reported decision of the Government of Papua New Guinea to postpone the scheduled 1976 election for one year, which in effect would postpone <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Day? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion will not affect the date of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which will be decided by the House of Assembly in accordance with a resolution of the House of 9 July 1 974 which provided: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until <span class="highlight">independence</span>, an extension of the period beyond four years would require the approval of the Australian Government and an amendment of the Australian Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people fought for their national <span class="highlight">independence</span> as they were entitled to do, just as the American people were entitled to do in 1770 when they waged their War of <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, and as people all over the world are fighting for the principles of self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its immediate consequence must be a communist takeover of South Vietnam snuffing out the hope of freedom and of democratic <span class="highlight">independence</span> in that country and extending the area of communist control closer to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the people of whom General MacArthur said in Tokio, when commenting on British and French use of Japanese troops to try to defeat the Vietnamese <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement: ‘If there is anything that makes my blood boil it is to see our allies in Indo-China and Java deploying Japanese troops to reconquer the link people we promised to liberate ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The history of Vietnam has been told so many times: That Vietnam was once an independent country, a country very proud of its <span class="highlight">independence</span>; that in the 1840s it became a French colony; that the resistance to the French colonialists did not cease through all the time it was a colony; and that when the Vichy French collapsed and did not fight, when the Japanese invaded Indo-China in 1942, our allies in resistance to the Japanese, the comrades in arms of Australian soldiers, were the Vietnamese National Liberation Front, the Vietminh under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, who carried on the fight as our allies against the Japanese while the French colonial governors collaborated with the Japanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to hear members of the Liberal and Country Parties talk about national <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the same way as it was rather sickening to hear certain American politicians talk about national <span class="highlight">independence</span> when they fought to retain the French empire in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>North Vietnam is an independent country which has fought for its <span class="highlight">independence</span> against all foreign invaders, and despite the fact that it follows what can be described as a communist ideology- and it is a communist ideology- North Vietnam is part of neither a Soviet camp nor a Chinese camp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Australian Government convinced that as a result of our good relations with Indonesia the people of Portuguese Timor will be able to gain their <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Portugal and that the Australian and Indonesian Governments will assist the Timorese people in their moves for self-determination? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Altogether the provisions of the Bill should ensure the proper control and accountability of one of the nation’s important cultural institutions, while at the same time providing the vital elements of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility which the institution requires to achieve the greatest measure of effectiveness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750417_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If that bright Independent had maintained his <span class="highlight">independence</span> and had been prepared to stay in this place that night and vote with the Government we would have got the Bill through, but he was on his way back to Albury when this vital legislation on the notice paper was waiting to be ratified to give the people in Darwin, the people who were suffering, the assistance that they so urgently required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a great pity that, in this early bright new age when we had an independent commission before this amendment was accepted, we are allowing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission to go by the board and instituting political control of the Commission’s functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The history of the framing of the sections of the Constitution under which this legislation is presented shows that the main concern of those who were engaged in the discussions was the degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an interesting reflection that more than 75 years ago the thinking amongst the leading political figures should have been not whether there should be an Inter-State Commission but what its powers should be and the extent of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that it should enjoy from the government and any arm of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policies that we look to in a Bill relating to the Grants Commission are policies which would give local government a much better deal and a much greater assurance of survival and of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered that in 1970 the previous Government thought fit to incorporate Parliamentary Counsel as a statutory corporation for the purpose of giving it an <span class="highlight">independence</span> and therefore, it was thought, increased efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood and  Senator Scott,  who spoke for the opposition on the Bill earlier this year, claimed that they opposed it because simultaneous elections would damage the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and alter its role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate was not founded on elections being held for the 2 Houses at different times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, the rights and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate will in no way be abrogated by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was because they had established for themselves a place in histroy based upon the complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> that they were accorded after 1688, practising their jurisdiction before the public and therefore open to public criticism, adopting a strict adherence to the rules of law and minimising discretion to the limit, adopting an impartiality and, most of all, governed by a traditional doctrine which made them a cohesive mechanism for the administration of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is proposed to retain this system in Australia after <span class="highlight">independence</span> but, as the Treasurer  (Dr J. F.

    <p>The Bill also contains some other measures related to Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, whether the Government likes the programs or not, as a Government we have said categorically that we guarantee programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as encouraging the growth of public and access programming, we have insisted on the political and programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission stations and the other stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth point which I think arises in consideration of this Bill is that dependence upon government is a potential threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of any company which is dependent upon government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a menace in that particular provision, which I do not say is likely to be applied in this case, but any company which submits to the requirement that the Government, because it is paying out a sum of money to help it over difficult times, can require from that company any information which the Government wants is putting itself in a position where it cannot maintain its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am simply saying that a company which receives the money exposes itself to the obligation to provide that information and thereby loses something of its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the churlish impertinence to think that he can get a group of judges who will man this court and be as obedient to him in administering justice as the Cavanaghs, the Camerons and the Cairnses, but judges have an <span class="highlight">independence</span> more durable than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This organisation must maintain its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and above all it must maintain its own faith in its academic and scientific integrity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks to amend the tax law so that after <span class="highlight">independence</span> Papua New Guinea will be treated as a separate country for Australian tax purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exception to this case is in the form of double tax relief to apply after <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The changes are to be synchronised with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea, whenever that comes about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cannot claim in his letter, which is dated 1 5 July, some special sort of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and at the same time be a party to a Government ambush. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were in Opposition we made certain demands of a similar nature and I believe that we were as guilty then of trying to undermine the integrity or the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service by so doing, but we live and learn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The death of  President  Mujib who brought his country to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1971 is a matter of very deep regret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs which refers to the stated intention of the dissident group on Bougainville to declare <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Papua New Guinea on 1 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not read the whole of that statement, but the Prime Minister made the following points: It remains Australia’s firm policy that Papua New Guinea come to <span class="highlight">independence</span> as one country in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Papua New Guinea’s elected representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, if given effect, would be an illegal act which could not itself alter in terms of the law of Papua New Guinea, the authority of the Government of Papua New Guinea over the whole of the territory of Papua New Guinea, or detract from Australia’s international rights and duties under the trusteeship agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister had given  Mr Somare  renewed assurances of Australian support and had every confidence that the move to <span class="highlight">independence</span> on 16 September of a united Papua New Guinea would proceed smoothly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had suggested there was an alternative course, namely, the use of a referendum which would have emphasised Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that is the appropriate course because it does emphasise Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We desire to see the appeal to the Privy Council removed entirely, and we trust that in due course the Australian people will be given the opportunity to do it in a way which is consistent with this nation’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and with the verdict of the Australian people, but to do it in a way which invites a British Parliament to legislate for Australia is, we believe, not only inconsistent with Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also a most remarkable instance of the inconsistency of the Prime Minister who, having adopted one view when in Opposition, chooses in power, to adopt a course which reflects our dependence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have no national obligations or interest in getting rein.volved in colonial or post colonial affairs in Portuguese Timor at the very time when Papua New Guinea’s imminent <span class="highlight">independence</span> is leading to the ending of our colonial role there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy is tangible evidence of our long-term objective to return a greater degree of choice and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to individuals and to families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this means that there will be a disincentive on the part of people to avail themselves of a measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span>; in other words, to look after themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure many students wish to have some <span class="highlight">independence</span> while continuing their studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those people to have access to a tertiary loans system which would provide for them <span class="highlight">independence</span> and remove the hardship and interruption to their studies would be of assistance if they wished to pursue to degree status the courses on which they had embarked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not reject alliances or downgrade friends but should be prepared to assert our requirements where necessary by developing <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self reliance in defence policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should never be forgotten that in making our own former colony independent, we as Australians enhance our own <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation includes four Bills which are associated in various ways with Papua New Guinea’s move to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the islands to be brought within the territorial scope of Papua New Guinea, so that at <span class="highlight">independence</span> that country will exercise full sovereignty over the islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither those with good personal reasons for hating Nazism nor those who, for whatever reason, support the U.S.S.R., can plausibly claim that particular atrocities justify the suppression of the Baltic or any other nations’ <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that Baits should stick to the main theme of Baltic rights to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and not act in such a way as to be publicly identified with, for example, all foreign policies of the U.S.A. or domestic ones of the Union of South Africa simply because those governments are anti-Soviet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advised him that it was the Government’s desire, because of the legislative timetable, to pass the Papua New Guinea Bill 1975, the Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Bill 1975, the Papua New Guinea Loans Guarantee Bill 1975, the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Bill 1975, and the Social Services Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they assume on <span class="highlight">independence</span> responsibilities in law which they have had for a number of years in fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Bill is, of course, the major Bill because it formally constitutes the act by Australia under which we acknowledge we no longer possess sovereignty and it is the measure by which the new nation finds itself on its own with a constitution of its own creation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Bill is a Bill which marks the end of Australia’s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider it appropriate to refer to the preamble to the Bill, which is described as a Bill for an Act relating to the attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant to note, as the preamble indicates, that Australia is formally giving to a part of its own Territory not simply self government but <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever may be the doubts, I think that the course which is clearly to be taken is the course of assuming that the power of the Commonwealth to grant <span class="highlight">independence</span> to its territories must be taken to be implied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to promote the political, economic, social, and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards selfgovernment or <span class="highlight">independence</span> as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a constant assertion by the Liberal and Country Party governments which had the responsibility for 23 years of, I think, the 30-year period of the trusteeship obligation that <span class="highlight">independence</span> would occur as and when the people of the Territory decided that they wanted their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Toliman resolution in 1964 was the first resolution which affirmed that it would be the members of the House of Assembly who would decide questions of self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A second resolution was passed in 1969 by the House of Assembly which asserted that the time of selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span> was for the people of Papua New Guinea to decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the final resolution, in the middle of 1974, was that steps should be taken which would lead inexorably to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which will take place on 16 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought, in what was generally a completely bipartisan approach by the parties which have alternated in government in Australia towards the question of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Papua New Guinea, there was only one area in which there might have been any fluctuation or difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were various seminars and conferences which were arranged in Papua New Guinea in the late 1960s at which the people of Australia, including the present Governor-General, interested themselves intensely in the form which the ultimate <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea would take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the procedure under which Papua New Guinea will acquire its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We only hope that the work which they have set in motion will, on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this Territory, be work which brings forth the fruit which they hoped that it would. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that even after 16 September when <span class="highlight">independence</span> is granted to Papua New Guinea, Australia will still have a part to play- maybe in an advisory role- to assist Papua New Guinea to be able to continue and prosper as a new nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should never be forgotten that in making our own former colony independent, we as Australians enhance our own <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one who would hate to see the situation in which Papua New Guinea became financially or otherwise dependent on some other nation that may threaten that particular <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should never be forgotten that in making our own former colony independent, we as Australians enhance our own <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sources prior to <span class="highlight">independence</span> until such time as the loans in question have matured and been repaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have travelled through various parts of what was then known as the Territory over a period of years and I think I can truthfully say that the people themselves wanted, in fact needed, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and they wanted to set their own date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor Government has precipitated the declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They decided when <span class="highlight">independence</span> was going to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a forced draught process of trying to bring Papua New Guinea to a state of <span class="highlight">independence</span> as a result of pressures from the United Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the characteristic way in which the United Nations goes about these matters it has said that the inability of a people to govern themselves is no reason why their <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be withheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this forced draught system of pressure from the United Nations the people of Papua New Guinea have the best <span class="highlight">independence</span> that money can buy for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this forecast, regretfully and with no pleasure: In the next 10 years Papua New Guinea will present greater problems to Australia than it has presented under the forced draught system by which we have brought it to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the new nation of Papua New Guinea which we are ushering into <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the next fortnight is what I describe as a centrifugal nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any public servant of high order and any politician of some knowledge would realise, for example, that in the end on every occasion when attempts have been made to see that the expatriate officers who have been working in a country which has attained <span class="highlight">independence</span> have been guaranteed their pension from that country to which they have contributed for most of their lives, have not been paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government has been perfectly correct in making the Ministry of Papua New Guinea realise that it has an obligation to accept some of the responsibilities of <span class="highlight">independence</span>; that is, they will have to learn to stand on their own feet and not become a mendicant society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will provide for a statutory guarantee by Australia in respect of repayment, on and after the date on which Papua New Guinea attains <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of New Britain are always demanding that they should have their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of my very brief contact with the Territory, a period of some 2 years in the mid-1960s, that I wish to make at least some expression of goodwill to Papua New Guinea as it moves into <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dedication and intelligence of a great number of the people I saw living in New Guinea, people who had been there for many years and many of whom have stayed there through to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, far exceeded my expectations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 2 new commissions into which the former Post Office was broken up, the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Postal Commission, are in a novel and exceptional position vis-a-vis other statutory authorities in this country in that they enjoy a greater measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, in fact almost total <span class="highlight">independence</span>, as against the relationship of the ordinary statutory authority to the relevant Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the reverse of the policy of the present Government which, as the GovernorGeneral stated yesterday, is:   to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have a maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is to encourage development of an Australia in which people have maximum freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> to achieve their own goals in life, in ways they decide … the Government does not believe that the poor and disadvantaged can be best helped by increasing the dependence of everyone on what the Government chooses to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until very recently, women in our society, through a variety of formal barriers, traditional prejudice, and sheer neglect by policy makers, were denied equal access with men to education, health care, job training, employment, wage justice- in all, to the possibility of real <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it ironical and very disappointing that this long overdue measure- the first step towards giving supporting mothers a modicum of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and dignity- has been questioned by some adherents of the Liberal philosophy on the grounds that it may be creating an unhealthy dependency in these women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recognising that all people need marketable skills in order to achieve economic <span class="highlight">independence</span> and that many people through lack of opportunity, retrenchment or technological change lack such skills, the Labor Government set up the National Employment and Training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More than half the applicants under this program have been women thus demonstrating to honourable senators on the other side of the chamber who need to have this pointed out to them that women, when given the opportunity, are in fact anxious to acquire skills that lead to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable senators opposite that the rights with which they are so concerned, such as the rights of individuals to pursue <span class="highlight">independence</span>, to make their own choices and to notch up their own little measures of achievement, are rights which can be exercised only by people who have had the opportunity to acquire skills, knowledge and confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been argued, firstly, that the States have little expertise and, secondly, that they have little interest in these matters, but if the State and local governments were given more <span class="highlight">independence</span> in raising and spending their own revenue the voters in each of those 2 important areas of government would soon make sure that they were being well served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I believe that whilst we all have colleagues from the other place in our own separate party rooms, we must at all times in this place maintain our <span class="highlight">independence</span> as members of a House of the Parliament within the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is true to say also that, certainly when we were in government before, the Senate committees functioned without fear or favour to or from the Government and that the Senate committee chairmen exercised great <span class="highlight">independence</span> in carrying out their duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that honourable senators have a greater capacity for exerting that necessary <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Executive than do our colleagues in the other place occasionally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also felt, having regard to the traditional acceptance of the role of the judiciary in Australia as being an independent one, that the fact that the Director-General is a judge symbolises in some way the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation from the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We hope, in relation to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation, that the concept of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of its Director-General will be maintained by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, it is due to the institution of the Senate itself and its record and tradition of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate is to develop its role and, indeed, maintain the role of Parliament in the community it has to retain that <span class="highlight">independence</span> of government which, I believe, has been a notable feature of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From my own experienceI served in the lower House of my own State Parliament for a term- I am able to make the contrast between the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of government of the 2 Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that <span class="highlight">independence</span> of government is the basic reason for the Senate’s success in developing the committee system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we allow the Industrial Court, a by-product of the Boilermakers’ case of 1956, to become a polyglot, ratbag resort for justices according to political convenience, we are exposing it to the utmost risk as to the integrity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary in the industrial field where the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of the judiciary is demanded in a special fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A constitutional lawyer ought to grant that the issues involved in this crisis have nothing at all to do with <span class="highlight">independence</span> or colonialism, or hereditary monarchy, but everything to do with the rational coherence of the parliamentary system, which requires an effective head of state with the responsibility of acting in the way that  Sir John  Kerr has acted, in the most unusual sort of circumstances here involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What progress has been made towards the establishment of a coarse wool breed sheep in Australia which would give greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the local carpet manufacturing industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of exercising those responsibilities he must give concern and attention to ensuring the nation’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and to protecting it from subversion, inside and outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to respect the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the integrity of the public servant in the administration of his duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope this is so; I think we all hope it is so- but also the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which they ought to have - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was an interesting answer because the Minister was talking about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that local government ought to have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the Government’s federalism policy not only will local governments be better off financially but also the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which they ought to have will be restored to them . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I have seen comment in the Press regarding the future <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and discussion on advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the policy of the Federal Government to maintain the true <span class="highlight">independence</span> and objectivity of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In saying that I make these points: <span class="highlight">Independence</span> in itself is not a goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress this emphatically: Those who talk of <span class="highlight">independence</span> often seek license and that is fundamentally wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intervention of  Senator Button  reminds me that those who argue about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC in fact practise continual intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, what the Opposition wants is <span class="highlight">independence</span> to intervene itself to make the ABC its political captive, but it wants every time - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, what are the Government’s intentions regarding the continuing <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Film and Television School? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I heard, amongst other things, our friend  Senator Carrick,  as the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson),  express the opinion on behalf of the present Government that whilst there should be freedom of expression and freedom of <span class="highlight">independence</span> on the part of the Commission that did not mean  ipso facto  that there should be freedom of expression and licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I would not agree with the proposal at the time because, amongst other things, I thought that the adoption of such a proposition would very much compromise the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say quite sincerely and in good conscience that when I was the Minister for the Media in the Australian Government I not only fought for but also at all times insisted upon the strengthening of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge any honourable senator opposite or any member of the Australian community to show where at any time I, as the Minister for the Media in that Government, did not insist upon and indeed demand the strengthening of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC, whether that be in relation to the political, sporting or programming aspects of the Commission’s service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Returning to my original theme, I point out that I fought very strongly in my own Party and in the Cabinet of which I was a member for additional finance for the Australian Broadcasting Commission and for the strengthening of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not once when I was Minister for the Media did I interfere or attempt to interfere in any way with any of those programs put on by the ABC that were critical of me personally because I knew that if as Minister I did interfere I would be involving myself and the Labor Government of which I was proudly a member in the very thing that I had fought against, that is, interference with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cronyism and cynicism in some of these appointments has made a mockery of the notion of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and must be embarrassing to the bodies concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this place we are used to receiving lectures from those who sit opposite us concerning the freedom and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of certain institutions and of the Press and concerning the necessity for Press councils to protect the right of freedom of expression of all sorts of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> from political control is something journalists have rightly fought for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> in itself is not a goal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those who talk of <span class="highlight">independence</span> often seek license and that is fundamentally wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of what has been said by the honourable senator is consistent with the Government’s attitude towards the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the individual in whatever circumstances he or she may find himself or herself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The worldwide British revolution really got under way in 1947 when the socialist British Government gave <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the socialist Indian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the idea of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from autocratic and aristocratic rule has been changed to a demand for <span class="highlight">independence</span> from colonial masters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, standards and quality of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC, however, is one perhaps much closer to home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This kind of attack causes very justified fear and concern in the community that indeed the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC is being threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a statutory authority in our legal structure is bound up with the terms of appointment of a  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the appointment of a  chairman-  a person of high status in the community, of appropriate qualifications and so on- for a set term of office that guarantees in the eyes of the community that the statutory authority concerned has <span class="highlight">independence</span>, is able to act with integrity and is not able to be used as a political puppet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure to appoint a  chairman  puts the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was some benefit to Indonesia in monetary terms- though one could say that there was not a great deal of benefit- and eventually we saw <span class="highlight">independence</span> come to Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in the fight for <span class="highlight">independence</span> we saw the rise of  President  Sukarno whose regime tragically as time went by brought economic and political instability and a great rundown in what had been the structural developments of that country- the roads, the railways, the ports and other infrastructures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party keeps insisting that the goal of a statutory corporation should be its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Independence</span> is good and is discharged only if the body exercising it is fair, objective and balanced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not and if it is unfair and biased, <span class="highlight">independence</span> is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party supports this subsidy because of the necessity to maintain a nitrogenous substance industry for the continued growth of the sugar and other horticultural industries, and, more importantly, in order to gain <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the fluctuation of supplies from major nitrogenous substance exporting countries such as Japan and the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We became the guests of the Portuguese authorities who had begun the process of decolonisation, preparing the people for the act of self-determination and for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered that in July the UDT, which previously was in unity with the Fretilin forces for the purpose of the transference of political power for the act of selfdetermination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, broke with the Fretilin movement following a visit by leaders of that movement to Australia and Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated to us that he was sympathetic to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement, that he had no time for Indonesia and that we should use every endeavour possible when we returned to Australia to alert the Australian people to the possibilities of an invasion by Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then this person, lo and behold, catches a plane to the United Nations for the purpose of presenting a point of view opposite to that of the legitimate government, the Fretilin government, which proclaimed its <span class="highlight">independence</span> in October of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: If this is correct, would she review any such appointment, having regard firstly to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the tribunals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 23 March  (Hansard,  page 660)  Senator Button  asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning the vacancy of the position of  Chairman  of the Film and Television School and the Government’s intentions regarding the continuing <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the School. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services been drawn to a report appearing in this morning’s  Canberra Times  newspaper under the dateline ‘Cocos Islands’ which states that the Minister, amongst other things, told Malay workers on the Clunies Ross estate that troublemakers could be in bother if they continued their actions and that he did not believe islanders would understand concepts of <span class="highlight">independence</span> or citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, does the Minister seriously suggest that none of the Cocos-Malay community has any understanding of the concepts of <span class="highlight">independence</span> or of citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that to imagine that all of them, or a great majority of them, understand all the sophistication of international politics and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and all that that brings forth is to whistle in the dark. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of this policy is to assist people to overcome hardship and insecurity in ways which ensure that they retain the maximum scope for <span class="highlight">independence</span> and achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time he has reduced the spending capacity of the pensioners in this country, on his own admission, by some $3 1 m. I believe that it is sad to hear the Prime Minister proclaim that his Government will give people more <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the use of their money and more freedom to spend their money as they wish and then deprive those in the community who, through no fault of their own, have the least financial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That such a station would therefore represent a further deterioration of Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and initiatives towards a non-aligned and peaceful foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst that <span class="highlight">independence</span> exists we must realise that comments like that may from time to time be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he give an assurance that any government organisation to be involved in ethnic broadcasting will be given <span class="highlight">independence</span> in its operation from any government department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was then reported as having told the Cocos Islands workers that trouble makers would be in bother if they continued their actions and that he did not believe that many islanders would understand the concepts of <span class="highlight">independence</span> or citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government ought to declare itself quite clearly and say whether it intends to destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission by imposing its priorities on the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just 2 years ago, on 25 April 1974, the Portuguese people overthrew the fascist regime in their country and set in train an <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1974, only 6 months after the people of Timor had been given the opportunity to be involved in the process of decolonisation, the Indonesian Security Council decided to set about the process of undermining and subverting the nationalist and <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the evidence coming out now clearly is that 2 generals in particular in Indonesia, General Murtopo and Lieutenant-General Murdani set about, in the process of subversion, to undermine the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that reference ought to be made to the fact that in April and May of last year the leaders of the UDT movement, who hitherto had supported the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement, came to Australia, visited Canberra, spoke to officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence and to others, then went to Jakarta, subsequently broke the coalition and, a few short months after that in July of that year took steps to wage a coup in Dili. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In point of fact, I participated in a somewhat minor role, after my discharge following the last war, in the famous Margaret Street demonstration which had as its aim the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Indonesia from the Dutch who were then the colonial power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is not to be wondered at that when Portugal ultimately removed the fascist regime- I use the word ‘fascist’ not as a term of abuse, but as a word which the Portuguese authorities used to describe themselves- and <span class="highlight">independence</span> was given to Timor there was a state of general confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their claims were made not on the basis of race or culture but on juridical grounds about the integrity of the Netherland East Indies which had acquired its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in those circumstances the Indonesians can justify no claim whatsoever, apart from some claim that if a little country near one’s border gets its <span class="highlight">independence</span> one is entitled to take it over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is to question the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this Government in foreign policy, one might point out that on that occasion Australia was not on the same side as the United States of America and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Local government found this irksome and it flies in the face of what we believe should be involved in local government, namely, a spirit of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and self-reliance, and not the spirit of a servant carrying out the orders of the central government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, if we really believe that local government has value because it is local- that there ought to be an element of local <span class="highlight">independence</span>- it is essential that the local governing body should have a degree of financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> and that it receive money which is not subject to direction as to how it should be spent and which will not be cut off if, through the efforts of the local government itself, it raises its standards to a level at which, on a needs basis, it will cease to qualify for assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we are genuine in our wish to retain a degree of local <span class="highlight">independence</span> and discretion, we have to step back from simply doing everything on a needs basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once that is done, it becomes inevitable that there is a supervision of standards, of revenue-raising and of every aspect of activity in such a way as to remove, in the long run, all local <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, in West New Guinea prior to the takeover there were parties of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, just as there were parties in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What right have the Left-controlled groups, such as the Miscellaneous Workers Union, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and the Association for International Co-operation and Disarmament to preach to the Australian people about <span class="highlight">independence</span> in East Timor when they or their predecessors did nothing- absolutely nothing- at the time of the Indonesian takeover of West New Guinea and the destruction of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the people of that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This, however, is a consequence of the speed with which events have moved in Papua New Guinea’s attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Staffing Assistance Group was devised as a mechanism to provide the Papua New Guinea Government with the professional, technical and high level administrative expertise which it needed, particularly in the period between selfgovernment and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Henderson recommended that supportive family services of all types should be made available on a local basis to allow more <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to give an increased range of choices to such families in terms of allocating times between earning and staying at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that this Government has the idea in the back of its mind that it must create an <span class="highlight">independence</span> among Australians and make them stand on their own 2 feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This measure is going to give some sense of <span class="highlight">independence</span> to mothers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To some degree, the mother now will have that feeling of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which her working counterpart has always had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This feeling of <span class="highlight">independence</span> is most important, no less to the mother in the home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Insofar as the statement suggests that many of these matters can be resolved by making the boards smaller in size and by making their responsibilities to the Council more explicit and at the same time preserving their <span class="highlight">independence</span> in matters of artistic judgment, this seems to us to be totally unobjectionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not criticising this measure but I am criticising the claim that this improvement in the child endowment payment, by itself, constitutes some sort of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the most important thing done by the Labor Government in relation to giving women real choice and <span class="highlight">independence</span> was the formulation of a national child care program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the services that have been mentioned are concerned, I believe them to be very important indeed in giving <span class="highlight">independence</span> to many older people who wish to remain in their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the General Assembly has exerted constant pressure on administering powers to implement articles 73 and 74 of the United Nations Charter not only to achieve selfgovernment but also to achieve <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This pressure infers that the United Nations’ conception of democratic government with self-government or <span class="highlight">independence</span> is,  ipso facto,  better than the existing system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The processes of government in this country meant that any <span class="highlight">independence</span> given to the Commission was at best curtailed by the influences of the Public Service- influences such as that of the Public Service Board on staffing, perhaps of the Treasury on finance and of other established departments in the welfare field in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission itself reported that it was its lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span> that created many difficulties and that it was the lack of functions that it found most difficult to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> which the Commission was given under statute included the right to institute inquiries and undertake related research; and to provide reports to the responsible Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently, it was perceived by some to have a substantial degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and as a result co-operation between the Commission and those interested in policy analysis and review developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that those statements that have been made with regard to its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the value of that need to be taken into consideration in the context in which the Commission finally reported on its own activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for these sorts of reasons that public concern about the integrity, high repute and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the national broadcasting service in Australia has been so great and has been the subject of so much discussion in the Press and elsewhere during the last few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the Government interfering with the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the integrity and the high repute of the Australian Broadcasting Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it abundantly clear that in the whole of the two or more decades of Liberal government in the 1950s and the 1960s never at any time could it have been said that there was any interference with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC or that any directions were given to the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that if we want integrity, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and programs and management of high repute in the Australian Broadcasting Commission we have to look back to the times of Liberal governments because that is when they were demonstrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is no fact produced to show that the Government is interfering with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The motion claims:  failure of the Government to ensure the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, integrity and high repute of Australia’s national broadcasting service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is claimed that we are failing to ensure the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, integrity and high repute of the national broadcasting service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the terms in which this motion is couched, that is, the condemnation of the Government for its ‘failure to ensure the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, integrity and high repute ‘ of the ABC, I think it is fair to remind  Senator Martin,  who has just resumed her seat, of some of the complaints which were cited by  Senator Button,  who led for the Labor Party in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clear argument is that in some way they want the Government to intervene, to exert some kind of pressure, but we believe in the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC and we do not see any reason why we should move in to insist that the commissioners do or do not take any course of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although I do not approve of some of the things that it does, and I do not approve of some of the things that have been made clear in this debate, I believe in the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they want us to intervene, it is they who are suggesting that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the integrity of the ABC be breached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>it is a matter for judgment as to the extent to which you should attempt to limit in a very direct sense what the services should do or whether you should leave it up to their <span class="highlight">independence</span> to use their money in what way they see as the most effective way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Memorandum, which was signed in December 1973, was intended to cover trade relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea in the period between self-government and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it were not a serious matter it would in fact be rather humorous to witness, as we do,  Mr Wran  in my State of New South Wales virtually posing as the defender and promoter of federalism and complaining bitterly that his State, as a government and as local government within its area, has lost a measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this episode it is well to reflect that a Commissioner of Police must have a certain amount of autonomy or <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other hand, if he has no <span class="highlight">independence</span> the police force itself becomes just an arm of government and we may then have what is often called a police state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Indonesian Government feels that is has the authority to move into Timor and make the expression of self-determination itself I think it has to be said that Indonesia cannot claim to represent the Timorese people when, in fact, all the leaders of the Timorese <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement are still alive and happy in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No member of the provisional government, the liberation forces or the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement has, in fact, been captured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is about time this Government reaffirmed Australia’s position in the United Nations and established a modicum of relationship between the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement of Timor and this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More than anything else, therefore, the closure of the Telecom link seeks to deny to the world as well as to Australia any information about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The contents of the reports also show that the Government’s rapid acquiescence in Indonesian policy denies the existence of a strong and viable <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it ought to be remembered that at the time of the treaty in 1947 or 1948 between the representatives of the then Indonesian <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Movement and the Government of The Netherlands, as a result of the efforts of the United Nations Good Officers Commission, of which the Australian representative was the  Chairman,  it was agreed- the Indonesians at that time claimed that this should be so- that the republic of Indonesia, in its territory, should be co-extensive with what until then had been The Netherlands East Indies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, Nauru, was a trust territory administered by Australia for many years until 1968 when it gained its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and this Parliament was involved by the Nauru <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Act 1967 which made provision for the Nauruan people to adopt their own constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But above this is an organisation which, if one reads the Green report, is held to be a fairly good organisation but one which, if it needs improving, needs improving in relation to establishing its own <span class="highlight">independence</span> of activity and creating in regard to current affairs a much more full-blooded and forthright attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that somebody in what has become such a controversial position since  Sir Henry  became  Chairman  of the ABC and during a period when we have a government which has conducted an unceasing onslaught on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC, can address a meeting of people connected with the ABC and then have it claimed on his behalf afterwards that he was merely making personal statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have legislation which undermines the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC, if we have financial strictures which limit the ability of the ABC to make programs such as those, we will not continue to have them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said before, the goal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is often argued as being the goal of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will note that they closely follow the arrangements in force during the interim period since Papua New Guinea <span class="highlight">independence</span>, as set out in documents tabled by my predecessor in the previous Government on 9 October 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Senate may look with pleasure and with no little pride upon the fact that in this new era of Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and national sovereignty, it has joined with Australia to re-affirm a clear and mutual interest in close co-operation and consultation in defence matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, honourable senators will be aware that the former Australian consul in Dili,  Mr Dunn-  a person who represented this country there for some years, who has a love for the people and the country, and who is now employed in this Parliament- recently travelled to Portugal and that he has been able to show in a confidential report which I have been privileged to see and which has been made available to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Peacock,  that persons who are listed as having been massacred by Fretilin forces in Timor are in fact officials of the UDT movement and the Apodeti movement, the 2 other <span class="highlight">independence</span> movements in East Timor which, with the Fretilin movement, form the three main political groupings in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, the whole purpose of this Bill is to lower the status and to weaken the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing foreseen by those who gave so much thought to this Constitution which some people would dismantle almost with the levity with which they would smoke a pipe, was that we had to have a powerful Senate- a Senate which Quick and Garran writing at the time said was unquestionably the most important and one of the most conspicuous of all of the Federal features of the Constitution- because if the House of Representatives were elected with numbers proportionate to the people, the great metropolitan States of Victoria and New South Wales would have a commanding domination of the Parliament unless the Senate showed an <span class="highlight">independence</span> in its spirit to protect the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was considered that the proposals would have undermined the Federal structure and destroyed the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>would cut out the constitutional <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and open the way for progressive reduction of its powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see it as an attempt to downgrade the Senate and to weaken its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those honourable senators who oppose this Bill and were here in 1975-1 realise that not all of them were here in 1975 - really wanted to display some <span class="highlight">independence</span>, dignity or integrity, they had the opportunity then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested that we are afraid of being taken to election by the Prime Minister and facing the verdict of the voters because that will lessen our degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, will make us toe the line, and will ensure that the government of the time has an easier passage than many governments in the past have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established this fact- for indeed it is fact- I turn to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate and the necessity for this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To date the Senate has had all the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that it has needed to be an effective House of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statutory 6-year term is one of the strengths from which a senator derives his <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A 6-year term gives a senator a measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which a relationship between his term of office and a House of Representatives election would deny him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is a proposal to destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a growing importance of the role of somebody in Australia, with a certainty coming from that <span class="highlight">independence</span> and a strength from that <span class="highlight">independence</span>, independently to be able to fulfil the role of scrutiny of the Executive Government, of both arms of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the things about which people are concerned include whether the Senate should be neutered in some way, whether it should be abolished or whether it should be strengthened in its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They see no objection to this Party or any other political groups examining ideas for a more appropriate electoral system, and the 2 governments would welcome a delegation from the Representative Assembly at a meeting of Ministers in the near future to discuss the modalities of procedures towards self-government which could lead to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I simply repeat, let us get back to the real issue, the one that concerned people previously and the one that still concerns us- the question of the transference to the executive of the day of the power to dissolve this chamber, without confrontation, without deadlock and without good reason, and what that would do to the strength and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Local government also asks the Commonwealth Government to maintain an adequate road categorisation system, endeavour to achieve a uniform system of categories, resume 5 year forward planning and appropriations, and ensure that the proposed amalgamation of the Bureau of Roads with the Bureau of Transport Economics does not impair the important policy advisory role of the Bureau of Roads or its high level of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and professionalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While there is a promise of more freedom for individuals and a promise to increase and foster the strength and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and creativity of Australian people, it is clear that the sort of legislation to be brought down will make conditions worse for the ordinary working man and for the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-If Senator Wriedt desires to ask me about this every day I will be delighted because one of the great achievements of this Government is that it is making for the first time at the State and local government levels a correct and true sovereignty and a greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one who has taken a stand on this issue in the hope that people will vote No I sincerely hope that the people will preserve the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and character of the Senate and that they will not be carried away by the second voice being used by members of the present Government as distinct from that which they used in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand from the AttorneyGeneral that an ordinance dealing with the magistracy in the Territory and providing for <span class="highlight">independence</span> or emphasising the fact that magistrates have <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Public Service has been in the course of preparation and printing and it is hoped that it will come into force tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am regretful that if the Government is going to prohibit Australians from entering foreign countries for the purpose of engaging in hostile activity against the governments of those countries, or prohibit Australians from engaging in activities which are hostile to those governments, this situation should be capable of application to governments such as the Smith regime in Rhodesia which has been in office now since the unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> 7 years or 9 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Senate is able to exercise its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, as we have heard on so many occasions that it is- we have seen a great deal of evidence of that in respect of funeral benefits, pension rights, apple and pear stabilisation schemes, and even in respect of the recent referendums- in respect of mundane and parochial questions, if I may call them that, with which some of us feel we may want to be associated in the performance of our public duties, surely in the interests of humanity and in the interests of understanding our responsibilities as citizens to the people of Timor we can exercise that same <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take the view that it is cardinal to the principle of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judges that their emoluments are stated in statute passed through the Parliament and that they are paid not one cent more nor one cent less than their statutory entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no insinuation but one must be particularly careful in this regard because the law would never be where it is in its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and security and respect unless judges refused anything that was not their lawful entitlement, either on assumption of office, performance of office or quitting or office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whereas there is mounting evidence that some 60 000, perhaps as many as 100 000 East Timorese may have been killed since the invasion of East Timor by Indonesian forces; and whereas a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 1 2 December1975 stated that it ‘strongly deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of Indonesia in Portuguese Timor’ and ‘calls upon the Government of Indonesia to desist from further violation of the territorial integrity of Portuguese Timor and to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the Territory in order to enable the people of the Territory freely to exercise their right of self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>’; and whereas Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Andrew  Peacock, in a statement to the House of Representatives on 4 March 1976 described Australia’s policy on East Timor as clear’ and calling for the ‘withdrawal of Indonesian troops ‘, a cessation of hostilities’, ‘the implementation of an act of self-determination and a resumption of humanitarian aid through the International Committee of the Red Cross’, your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s legislation to remove the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Bureau of Roads was further evidence of its design to downgrade the priorities of road planning and road funding in the national accounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I query whether it is justified for the Schools Commission, the Opposition, the Australian Council of State Schools, the Australian Teachers Federation or anyone else to say that the Schools Commission has lost its <span class="highlight">independence</span> because the Government spelled out some financial guidelines completely in line with a policy which the Government announced years ago in relation to the financing of schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Matabele and the whites by the more populous Mashona- a situation that could not bring peace, order or good government to Rhodesia-  Mr Smith  had to declare <span class="highlight">independence</span> unilaterally from the United Kingdom, whose responsibility for its control was slight in law and slighter politically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision, which is in clause 5 of the Bill, obviously is aimed at providing this <span class="highlight">independence</span> that we believe it needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is terribly important if this new statutory officer is to have the complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> of direction which the Government intends him to have under this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beyond that, and to speak about less tangible but perhaps fundamentally more important aspects, small business fosters a spirit of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and initiative, so important in our liberal, democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Can the Minister say what are the threats to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission and whether the Government’s federalism policy will operate to throw the responsibility for government schools back to the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Prime Minister received a letter from the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, written at the request of the council of the university, expressing concern over the threat to the Australian National University’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> posed by the Commonwealth Employees Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see of course that the Assembly will need <span class="highlight">independence</span>, and we would want it to have <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one of the basic reasons that it is a statutory corporation is to give it the <span class="highlight">independence</span> to carry out what is called adequate and comprehensive programming under the Broadcasting and Television Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extraordinary thing about all this- and this should be of interest to Government senators- is that, whatever one says about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the fact is that thousands of people in Melbourne think that  Mr Lane  was removed because of an atmosphere which has been engendered in the Australian Broadcasting Commission by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that by this act it has been perceived by many people that not only has an attempt been made to take politics off the front pages of the newspapers but also has an attempt been made to stifle the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in a variety of ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that the sort of atmosphere in which that type of decision can be taken has been engendered over quite a period of time by the actions of various Ministers of this Government and more specifically by the repeated threats to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission which have been evidenced in the continued cuts in its appropriations made by this Parliament since the present Government came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are Ministers in the Government which repeatedly mouths cliches about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this sort of atmosphere, engendered by what is sometimes overt and in many cases covert interference with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, that this situation has come about in which members of the management staff of the Commission feel that they might be attracting favourable attention of their political mentors by taking the sort of action which has now been taken in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that  Senator Lajovic  as a politician would be well served if he stood up occasionally and expressed some genuine concern about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the broadcasting debates which take place in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">independence</span> ought not to be interfered with unless there is some evident impropriety, and clearly there is no impropriety in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion that is monkeying with judicial remuneration which is entirely wrong ‘in relation to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of countries have, under the impact of the oil crisis, adopted objectives of energy self-reliance’, ‘energy <span class="highlight">independence</span>’, or greater sufficiency’ in energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the years the service has been able to assist many thousands of severely handicapped people to reach or to regain <span class="highlight">independence</span> and, in a high percentage of cases, their capacity to undertake gainful employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priority will also be given to those cases where the breadwinner’s employment status is being affected because of the demands of caring for a disabled spouse living at home and who could be afforded more <span class="highlight">independence</span> through appropriate rehabilitation measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have begun to liberate Australia’s unmatched potential for equality, opportunity and personal <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main lesson to be learnt from the experience of ethnic broadcasting to date is the need for financial autonomy and program <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for this reason that we, both in this chamber and outside it, have stressed constantly the importance of preserving the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the objectivity of national broadcasting and of restraining the commercial sector when it acts in a way which is contrary to the public interest and to the interest of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many attacks were made on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC during the period of  Sir Henry  Bland’s chairmanship and, I think, in a more subtle way even since his chairmanship ceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But again the appointment of somebody with a clearly partisan background in terms of the industry,  Mr Bruce  Gyngell, caused a great deal of scepticism throughout the community as to the objectivity and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will lack all the qualities of political <span class="highlight">independence</span> that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has and will be subject to direct political control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way the ABC, which has managed to retain a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> would have its <span class="highlight">independence</span> quite seriously eroded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can think of none other than devious motives on the part of the Government for introducing this modification of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He certainly does not look shocked, but does look quizzical when I suggest that there are devious motives on the part of the Government for including clause 15, which erodes the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to be no <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the new Special Broadcasting Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That relates to the setting up of the Special Broadcasting Service and the criticism which is made by the Staff Association, a criticism which I think is exaggerated, is that the provision could be used as a means to limit the programming <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and, therefore, should be opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned already what has been said about political <span class="highlight">independence</span> and refer now to what the Minister,  Mr Eric  Robinson, said on 4 November last year when speaking to the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of the Australian Broadcasting Commission will be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity of the Australian Broadcasting Commission are matters on which on many occasions I have made public utterances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stand firmly for that <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is important but I do not think that the clause to which I have referred does anything really to touch that <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But under this provision, a government could prescribe principlesthat is a word of considerable looseness- which I think could be such as to restrict greatly the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ethnic services which are being provided in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only say that for some 23 years in the administration of the media in this country governments of Liberal faith maintained throughout the media, particularly through the Australian Broadcasting Commission, an <span class="highlight">independence</span> of activity by the media and an absence of bias by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The appointee does not need to have any degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> about him provided that after he is appointed he divests himself of financial interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides a direct and overt opportunity for political interference in the licensing process, it undermines the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Broadcasting Tribunal and it is an unpopular proposal with all sections of the broadcasting industry- commercial, public and national. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is anything that is anathema to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this chamber, to the separate existence of this chamber and to this chamber being able to fulfil its constitutional role relating to the scrutiny of the Executive and ensuring the accountability of the Executive, if there is anything which could destroy that it is a system of joint committees where the Senate is the poor relation of the greater number in the House of Representatives, where we are taken on suffrage in some way to do the bidding of the House which represents the executive government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no knowledge of what the conditions are in respect of other police commissioners although I have a feeling that in my own State of Western Australia the only way in which a police commissioner can be dismissed is by resolution of both Houses of Parliament, lt has been generally held that persons holding this office should enjoy a great deal of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from arbitrary acts of the executive government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the Government’s most recent actions was a move to curtail the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the changes will not compromise the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC, nor its role in advising the Government on the nature and levels of assistance which should be afforded particular industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no problem at all in preserving both the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission and its ability to report to the Government, The Bill requires the IAC, in making its recommendations, to take account of government policy, and requires the Temporary Assistance Authority to report on the degree of assistance required for a particular industry to maintain its level of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am extremely suspicious when there is a possible threat to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, but I have been unable here to sustain any such suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for those reasons- and answering an earlier interjection by  Senator Tehan-  that I say this legislation is considerably weakening, if not destroying, the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is not weakening the <span class="highlight">independence</span> or probably destroying the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the IAC, frankly I do not know what else it is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The powers that clause 8 seeks to allow any present or future government Minister are so broadly denned as to have the effect of emasculating the powers and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission and to politicise the whole operation of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is weakening its framework, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He claimed that the whole role of the IAC was to be changed by this legislation and said he was concerned about the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph (b) of the amendment states:  in threatening the basic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission, by its emphasis upon narrow and variable  guidelines,  and by its consistent failure to appreciate the advisory role intended for the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that must impinge upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The language that is usedshall comply with such directions’- obviously must impinge upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not always agree with its recommendations but I commend its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and its right to recommend to governments the simple facts of economic life as it sees them should never be threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in threatening the basic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission, by its emphasis upon narrow and variable guidelines, and by its consistent failure to appreciate the advisory role intended for the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to overcome this problem we should not attack the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second part of its amendment the Opposition has moved that the Senate deplores the action of the Government:  in threatening the basic <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission by its emphasis upon narrow and variable guidelines and by its consistent failure to appreciate the advisory role intended for the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other prong of attack on the Government is that the legislation threatens the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Industries Assistance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed  Senator Douglas  McClelland used quite extravagant language when he alleged that the legislation will destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not oppose the Bill, but at the same time it says that the Bill threatens the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were a serious belief on the part of the Opposition that this legislation threatened the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, it would be opposing the legislation; but of course it has made it clear that it is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the visit to this place today of a parliamentary delegation from Papua New Guinea and to Australia’s gift of a national library to Papua New Guinea on its attainment of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-At the time of Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1975 the then Australian Government announced that Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> gift to that country would be a national library building and associated books, files and equipment at a cost of up to $A2m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the light of those sorts of conditions and in the light of all the theory that exists in Australia about our responsibilities to Aborigines that we believe that the Senate should, as a place of review and as a place where <span class="highlight">independence</span> of thought is expressed from time to time, accept responsibility and put on record a request to the national Government to assume its rightful responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could perhaps be said that Australian women are seeking <span class="highlight">independence</span> in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recognition of their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, both economic and social, has been a matter of discussion in this country for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lesser opportunities given to women in other countries to assert their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to express their personalities may be attractive to Australian men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose if I were asked initially what attitude I take, I think I would follow  Senator Cavanagh  by simply referring to De Gaulle at the time of Algerian <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, that resolution re-affirmed the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever doubt the Australian Government may have had about its international obligations would have been removed by the resolution of the General Assembly in November last year rejecting the claim that East Timor had been integrated into Indonesia inasmuch as the people of that territory had not been able to exercise freely their right to selfdetermination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was a Labor Foreign Minister, the late  Dr H.  Evatt, who as  President  of the United Nations General Assembly so advanced the cause of Indonesian <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the 1940s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we respect Indonesia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> now and as we did in the 1940s- when in government the Labor Party fought not only for Indonesia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> but also for its integrity- we as a nation are obliged now to do as much for East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we say to the people of the Cook Islands and the New Hebrides-they were mentioned by somebody earlier- the Solomon Islands and the people of New Caledonia- some of whom have obtained their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and some of whom are working towards obtaining <span class="highlight">independence</span>- that if any aggressive neighbour such as Indonesia attacks them ruthlessly, bloodthirstily as in the case of East Timor, then idealism and morality, as  Senator Sim  said, do not count. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>recognised the importance of the newlyindependent island states and welcomed the movement towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> of several countries in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does that relate to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the people of East Timor? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yugoslavia acceded to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the context of the post- World War I settlement, to which Australia was a party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They spoke to me of their wish to have their councils control expenditure on community services in the Islands which are at present provided by the Queensland Department, as one step towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the management of their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has enhanced his freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an extraordinary omission from the report and I am grateful to see that the Senate, through the Senators on the Committee- perhaps  Senator Baume  is doing the right thing for the wrong reason- is asserting its <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the view taken by the House of Representatives on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hopefully, they will lead eventually to a greater degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the States in future years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that the Government is not the slightest bit interested in giving <span class="highlight">independence</span> to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no statutory grounds at all on which to guarantee the Council’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will know that Australia and Papua New Guinea have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before Papua New Guinea moved to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Second World War that Territory was administered in union with the Territory of New Guinea and, as the Third Schedule to the Papua New Guinea Act 1 949, as amended up to the time of Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>, makes clear, islands within the Torres Strait that were not part of the State of Queensland continued to be within the bounds of Papua New Guinea immediately prior to Papua New Guinea’s <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Major objectives  of that policy are to give the States and local government greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility to determine their expenditure priorities together with a concomitant increase in their financial capacity and flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before proceeding to speak about the treaty elements, I wish to recall that Australia and Papua New Guinea have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before Papua New Guinea moved to <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council will report to the Prime Minister- an administrative arrangement reflecting both the status and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of ASTEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Council is invested with sufficiently wide powers to enable it to execute its functions.Thirdly, provisions are made for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Council to enable it to undertake its functions effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third important purpose of this legislation is the provision of necessary <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Council in its actions, so that its advice can be provided to government freely and without unwarranted influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another important area where <span class="highlight">independence</span> is ensured is in the staffing of ASTEC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another provision designed to secure the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Council is clause 25 of the Bill, which exempts the Council and those working for it from legal action in relation to any act done in good faith and in accordance with ASTEC ‘s powers and functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would regard that as a hideous case of exploitation of one’s position as a representative of the people and I would regard it as a denigration and an unexampled surrender of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a judge who should stand by the salary fixed by parliament for his brothers as a salary that parliament will never alter except upward, as in recent times inflation has necessitated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It begins only as a trickle but gradually grows into a little eroding river, with public servants retiring prematurely, taking a lump sum payment or a periodical payment and then being re-appointed to their same position or to another position in the Commonwealth service, thereby increasing their emoluments, undermining the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Public Service and creating a terrific injustice to their fellow workers who should be expected to be able to take up those posts on the genuine retirement of those people and thus graduate by experience to serve the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Copper is the cornerstone of Zambia’s economy and since <span class="highlight">independence</span> it has provided more than 90 per cent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings and about half of government revenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said again and again that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the electoral commissioners is fundamental to the working of democracy because of the trust that people place in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When some evidence that was fit to be examined by a judicial tribunal whether there was any impropriety in the course of the Commissioners’ decision to give a name to an electorate in Queensland, this Government appointed a judge whose <span class="highlight">independence</span> and integrity has not been impuned by anyone; nor could it be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the Government to maintain the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity and high standard of national broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They include such attacks as the 1 5 per cent cut in funds in the first Lynch Budget, the imposition of staff ceilings and the staff wastage policy, what I might refer to as the  Sir Henry  Bland fiasco, the changes to the legislation affecting the ABC which have weakened its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, the introduction through legislation of a Special Broadcasting Service in terms which in the future will allow the Special Broadcasting Service to encroach upon the national broadcasting functions of the ABC, and the removal for blatantly political reasons of the ethnic radio station 3ZZ by the simple expedient of refusing to supply funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two changes would bring a measure of real <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is totally unrealistic at this stage of government policy and principles about funding public bodies to expect any statutory body that has to depend on an annual budgetary allocation to act with true <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The failure of the Government to maintain the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity and high standard of national broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first element of the matter of public importance is that the Government is accused of failure to maintain <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first challenge then is to answer the question: How is its <span class="highlight">independence</span> corrupted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deal first with <span class="highlight">independence</span> in terms of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of decision making, and <span class="highlight">independence</span> in control of staff, in control of programming and the whole range of matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, for one, simply say that I do not believe that a man of the quality and integrity of, shall we say, Laurie Short, would allow himself to be used or even allow himself to be in the presence of bias or any kind of corruption relating to the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity or integrity of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Broadcasting Commission, like this Parliament, is the servant of the people and it is given <span class="highlight">independence</span> not as an end in itself but in order to achieve objectivity, to achieve under section 51 of the Act comprehensive and adequate programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not given <span class="highlight">independence</span> for licence; it is not given <span class="highlight">independence</span> to do its own thing and to present its own beliefs and subjective values. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is given <span class="highlight">independence</span> so that it can achieve balance and objectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to <span class="highlight">independence</span> and objectivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has, in fact, brought considerable <span class="highlight">independence</span> and objectivity into the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of the matter is that today  Senator Ryan  came here to allege that there is a lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity, and high standards due to the Government’s failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Senate is debating the failure of the Government to maintain the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity and high standard of the national broadcasting service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do we mean in this motion by the words ‘the <span class="highlight">independence</span>’ of the Australian Broadcasting Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The classic example of what is really meant by <span class="highlight">independence</span> in a broadcasting service relates to the British Broadcasting Commission at the time of the Suez war in 1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an example of the sort of thing we mean by <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I quote from another distinguished Director-General of the British Broadcasting Commission on what it means by <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the sort of thing to which we should aspire in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we could get a statement in similar terms from the Minister, asserting the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the objectivity of the ABC then, of course, this matter of public importance would never have been raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is true to say that in the period when  Sir Robert  Menzies was Prime Minister of this country in a strange way a very genuine <span class="highlight">independence</span> was enjoyed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst other things, that public inquiry should be responsible for an assertion, supported by the Minister, that this Government regards the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC as an important matter and is prepared to guarantee it by the sorts of appointments which it makes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The failure of the Government to maintain the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity and high standard of national broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But neither he nor  Senator Ryan  gave any convincing evidence relating to <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity and a high standard of national broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Ryan,  who opened for the Opposition today and who is the spokesman on these matters, in no way brought any argument to bear on the matters of <span class="highlight">independence</span>, objectivity and high standard of national broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What does  Senator Ryan  mean by the word <span class="highlight">independence</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did she indicate to the Senate any way in which the Government has failed to maintain the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has maintained a consistent approach in ensuring the absolute <span class="highlight">independence</span> of” the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has placed some emphasis on the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC and on its attitude towards affairs generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick challenged the Opposition to produce one example of a member of the Government of his political persuasion or from his side of politics attempting to interfere with the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this independent statutory authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to  Senator Carrick  that that is as good an example as even he could want of interference in the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this independent statutory authority by a member of his side of politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Carrick  finds it mysterious that there are people on our side of politics who have their suspicions about his vaunted respect for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of this statutory body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The failure of the Government to ensure the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, integrity and high repute of Australia’s national Broadcasting Services ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do take issue with is that unfortunately we recognised the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC and possibly did not stipulate where those cutbacks should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have raised this matter this evening because this month marks the sixth anniversary of those events in Lithuania and elsewhere in the Baltic States when the people of the Baltic States took a stand for their freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> and, through those events, made their views known to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber, being afforded <span class="highlight">independence</span> by our party, have the right to stand up here and say: ‘The Government is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer now to the Department of Administrative Services again and to remind the Committee of what I was saying earlier and why  Senator Georges  was so upset I was just demonstrating that on this side of the House we are not rubber stamps and we are capable of exercising <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is a point of jealousy as far as the Opposition is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, what Professor Mathews argues is that the States, by reducing their taxation themselves, have opted not to take <span class="highlight">independence</span>, that they want the State rights but not the federalism, and that the fact that they have reduced their taxation has lowered the amount of money available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a paradox of Australian federalism that the States are vocally insisting on States’ rights in every respect except one, the right to financial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has argued that what is necessary is that the States be given freedom by way of more access to taxing themselves, if they so desire, and for them therefore to use the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that they would have from that to gain their sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He points out that they have reduced taxes themselves and have been unwilling to take <span class="highlight">independence</span>, but they have continued to hide behind the alibi of asserting that it is the Commonwealth ‘s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that Professor Mathews is saying is summed up in his comment that it is a paradox of Australian federalism that the States are vocal in insisting on States rights in every respect except one- the right to financial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is simply an affront to anybody who is asked to go out into the market place to earn his living and, by the system which I wish to maintain, to accumulate his own <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to provide a little capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is necessary only to cite those two occassions to show to what extent the improper abuse of this could be put in arranging resignations of judges, and in arranging for the weakening of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780606_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have reached the stage where the compression to five Ministers in this chamber ought, I think, to excite this chamber to take into serious consideration the principle whereby the business of the Senate would be advantaged if all the Ministers who are responsible for Executive government were in the House of Representatives and the managers, who would be of equal status to the Ministers and would have the responsibility of managing the business of the Senate, were in a confidential relationship with the Ministry, but occupied that degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which the Constitution requires all senators to occupy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People who hear  Senator Wriedt  must understand that he speaks from the Labor Party point of view, with an implacable dislike of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that on his retirement from the Senate many people, particularly in Queensland, will remember the contribution that he has made to this Parliament and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> that he has shown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In conclusion may 1 simply say that 1 note that on 9 March  President  Carter told  President  Tito, in Washington, that the United States ‘continued support of the <span class="highlight">independence</span>, territorial integrity and unity of Yugoslavia’ and also that he indicated that the United States would ‘take firm measures to prevent and prosecute criminal terrorist activities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of them are more developed than others; some are or used to be on the highways of the Pacific and in a position of what I would call a more immediate relationship; others have what I would describe as a colonial relationship; and others again are more recently emerging and enjoying a status of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these days, Papua New Guinea, with which we have a special connection and interest, has embraced its own <span class="highlight">Independence</span> and as a gift for its <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, the Parliament of New Zealand has given to the Parliament of Papua New Guinea a parliamentary library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the Liberal Party senators’ craven acceptance of the dictates of the member for Wannon, when the latter by fiat gave them their new leader and  deputy,  can the Leader of the Government in the Senate assure the Senate that it will hear no more cant or humbug from Liberal senators about States’ rights or their sturdy <span class="highlight">independence</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The platform and policy of my party stresses the greatest possible <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the citizen and the provision of assistance in a dignified, unobtrusive and sympathetic manner rather than through impersonal bureaucratic agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Bearing that in mind, I believe that the Bill should be supported but the legislation must be watched to ensure that it does not lead to any reduction in the number of persons who are able to be protected and able to be kept in their own homes and able to enjoy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> which they have had in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As long at our program encourages <span class="highlight">independence</span>, as long at it encourages rehabilitation in society and not exclusion from society, we probably will go in the right direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">independence</span> does not allow it to disregard the ordinary processes of law; it has a high responsibility to observe those processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dr Michael  Heppell, the  chairman  of the Panel, has said that it was the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Panel which upset the Department and the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">independence</span> enabled the Panel to criticise the Department and the Minister as well, and  Dr Heppell  has suggested that this is one of the reasons why it is being disbanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Taking out the fruity melodrama of the latter part of  Senator Primmer  ‘s question, the advice I have is that the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby has confirmed that two senior members of the OPM- the Organisasi Papua Merdeka- the Irianese dissident group which is seeking <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Irian Jaya from Indonesia, were arrested by Papua New Guinea authorities in Vanimo in the region of the Papua New Guinea-Indonesia border on 29 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be reasonable, however, to regard all those colonial territories, including many of the new states of the South Pacific, which came to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the course of the last decade as forming part of the Third World group of countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a member of the Council of Namibia, has Australia been kept informed of the progress of negotiations between the South African Government and the five members of the Security Council regarding the transition to <span class="highlight">independence</span> in Namibia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This involves a question of finding another method of arriving at the right form of organisation to enable a sense of direction to develop, a sense of social and political direction, in relation to Australian science policy yet at the same time retaining the very important factor of <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Organisation, a level of <span class="highlight">independence</span> it has enjoyed in the past and which I think it is necessary for it to enjoy in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One relates to whether the relationship between the employment of staff by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation under proposed new section 32 (2) and the normal requirements of the Public Service Board is such as to preserve the degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of scientific people working in the Organisation from the general constraints of the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I claim that this disruptive action has been provoked by the savage cutbacks which have been imposed by this Government- cutbacks in funding and staffing which have a clear political intent, that of limiting the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the ABC, of hamstringing its ability to provide the independent comment and news that are essential to Australian democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of their hostility to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, it has been severely hit in its funding arrangements; its standards necessarily have had to be lowered; it is losing its influence; it is losing its strength; and indeed it is losing its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later that year, the same Government, in response to an invitation from the then Australian Government to nominate the form which Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> gift might take, suggested a national library. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am indeed very well pleased with it and I am sure it will be a great asset to the community of Papua New Guinea and form a worthy <span class="highlight">independence</span> gift. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It’s a privilege to be here today to hand over Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> gift to your nation- the new National Library of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Papua New Guinea’s selection of a library for an <span class="highlight">independence</span> gift was a most significant choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I have great pleasure in now officially handing over Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> gift- the National Library of Papua New Guinea- to stand as a permanent reminder of the deep and enduring fellowship between our two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I think it is important to point out that whilst an <span class="highlight">independence</span> gift consisting of a National Library with all the contents to which 1 have referred may be a very valuable gift to a nation, we have got to look very carefully and indeed very sympathetically at the ongoing work from this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a further indication of our continuing involvement in this <span class="highlight">independence</span> project, arrangements are being made for staff from the National Library of Australia to visit Papua New G uinea for the purpose of engaging in staff training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly they should have <span class="highlight">independence</span> in the matters of artistic policy, performance, programs and so forth but they are not truly independent of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Incidental changes, contained in the Schedule to the Bill, are merely those designed to bring the Act up to date in the light of changed circumstances since the original Act was passed, such as the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the War of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> for the United States of America some fundamental principles of democracy were enunciated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-82-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite conceivable that employment by the Crown or in the Public Service could affect the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a member of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also relevant that we have increased the relative importance of general purpose (‘untied’) funds thus providing the States with more <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility in the conduct of their own affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-110-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Little or no attempt has been made to achieve uniformity in the justification for their initial creation, in the degree of operating <span class="highlight">independence</span> granted to them or in the strictness and form of their accountability requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we see it, therefore, the major problem which we face in an inquiry is to strike a proper balance between, on the one hand, the appropriate operating <span class="highlight">independence</span> of authorities and, on the other hand, their satisfactory responsibility and accountability to the Parliament and the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This results in variations in the degrees of operating <span class="highlight">independence</span> and accountability standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, what degree of operating <span class="highlight">independence</span> should be granted to authorities once established, especially in relation to their financial activities, their staffing arrangements and their dealings in property and other assets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Concerted United Nations’ efforts towards achieving self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for Namibia began in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plan, and proposals by the United Nations Secretary-General for its implementation, were later accepted by the United Nations Security Council as a basis for an internationally acceptable settlement that would give Namibia <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790220_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We suddenly find that in the case of Rhodesia, which I notice the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and everybody else, apart from  Senator Sheil,  on the Government side in both houses, refers to loyally as Zimbabwe, efforts have been made by not only the illegal Prime Minister,  Mr Smith,  not only by the representative of the chieftains, Chief Chirau, but also by two long-standing advocates- very brave advocates I would suggest- and leaders of African <span class="highlight">independence</span>, certainly people who could not be described as Uncle Toms, Bishop Muzorewa and the Reverend  Mr Sithole,  to come to some sort of peaceable agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether or not we agree with the system of government in Vietnam we should recongise that it developed because of a lack of understanding by the Western democracies of the need and the desire of the Vietnamese people for national <span class="highlight">independence</span> and freedom from a colonial yoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has continually been our attitude to fights for <span class="highlight">independence</span> or struggles for <span class="highlight">independence</span> by minor nations, we took the side of the exploiters and the ruling class and did not understand the innate feeling and desire for national <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by greatly increasing the power of the Minister to direct and restrict the Tribunal, it destroys its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and renders the Tribunal subject to considerable political influence and control in its day to day operations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not as if this policy of immunity from Australian legislation is being carried through to its logical, conclusion; namely, either complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Australia, which is one solution and one logical way of dealing with the kind of approach that the Government seems to have in mind; or something less than that but nonetheless quite substantial- a system of complete selfgovernment where the Norfolk Islanders would have complete responsibility for their domestic affairs and complete freedom from Australian Government interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the Government would consider this matter and, if it approves of the proposal, whether it would make that known to the directors and shareholders of the Bank of Adelaide which might then enable that bank to retain a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> instead of just joining one of the big conglomerates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This the Australian Law Reform Commission duly did, recommending in its ninth report of June 1978 a slightly modified version of its original proposals, but nonetheless one which retained very clearly and centrally the concept of a detailed complaint review procedure which did embody to an important extent the notion of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the police investigations themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mrs Thatcher also accepted the responsibility of the British Government to bring the country to legal <span class="highlight">independence</span> on a basis which the Commonwealth and the international community as a whole will find acceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The communique made nine points: The Heads of Government: confirmed that they were wholly committed to genuine black majority rule for the people of Zimbabwe; recognised, in this context, that the internal settlement constitution is defective in certain important aspects; fully accepted that it is the Constitutional responsibility of the British Government to grant legal <span class="highlight">independence</span> to Zimbabwe on the basis of majority rule; recognised that the search for a lasting settlement must involve all parties to the conflict; were deeply conscious of the urgent need to achieve such a settlement and bring peace to the people of Zimbabwe and their neighbours; accepted that <span class="highlight">independence</span> on the basis of majority rule requires the adoption of a democratic constitution including appropriate safeguards for minorities; acknowledged that the government formed under such an <span class="highlight">independence</span> constitution must be chosen through free and fair elections, properly supervised under British Government authority, and with Commonwealth observers; welcomed the British Government’s indication that an appropriate procedure for advancing towards these objectives would be for them to call a Constitutional conference to which all parties would be invited; and consequently, accepted that it must be a major objective to bring about a cessation of hostilities, and an end to sanctions as part of the process of implementation of a lasting settlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the fact is that they did go there and they did establish a colony which subsequently acquired some sort of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since they did that efforts have been made by the black majority of that country to obtain <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This desire of the African people for <span class="highlight">independence</span> was resisted- for the most part, foolishly- by the white settlers within that country, culminating in what happened in 1965 when the Government of  Mr Smith,  the Rhodesia Front Government of what was then <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Southern Rhodesia, made its so-called unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and subsequently established the Republic of Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact  Mr Smith  and those people who constituted his Government acted unlawfully in their unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, there was the illegal unilateral declaration of <span class="highlight">independence</span> by Smith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Schools Commission to recommend the allocation of funds to schools on the basis of need, unhindered by Government directives; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It exposed its own inquiry into the share transactions as a farce and permitted a licence, originally granted and recently renewed on the grounds of its <span class="highlight">independence</span> from other media holdings, to be acquired by one of the largest multi-media proprietors in Australia, probably one of the largest in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst some of its decisions might be regarded as open to criticism by members of the Opposition and some members of the Government, the fact is that it is established in its <span class="highlight">independence</span> to carry out those and other functions to which I shall refer shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Tribunal, in its <span class="highlight">independence</span>, has made its decision- as it is entitled to do- and I suggest that the argument is now thrown back to the politicians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However  Mr Moremon  undertook to pursue the points raised in the ALP’s submission and during the course of the public inquiry the applicant was questioned at length on matters relating to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Oberon from other Australian media interests and to the resident status of  Mr and Mrs Gordon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was contended, to put the point shortly and generally, that News Ltd’s record in the ownership and control of various forms of the media should lead to the conclusion that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and objectivity of Channel TEN ‘s news and public information services would be adversely affected if the transaction were to be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal would emphasise, however, and it notes the fact with approval, that firm and unequivocal assurances as to the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and impartiality of Channel TEN’s news and public affairs services were given at the Inquiry by senior News Ltd personnel and, indeed, by  Mr Murdoch  himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Tribunal, at this stage, would have no basis for any assertion that the disapproval of this transaction would preserve the “<span class="highlight">independence</span>” of Channel TEN or guarantee adherence to any general principle on the aggregation or concentration of media ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of 1977 which  Senator Melzer  referred to appears to contain many valuable suggestions for the future <span class="highlight">independence</span> of people who suffer from a physical or mentally retarded state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the opinion of  Senator Gietzelt,  it is a monster that seduces people into being what he calls credit addicts- a very poor and very paternalistic but not surprising socialist approach to the Australian person, as though the Australian is not a person of sufficient <span class="highlight">independence</span> and maturity to be able to handle his own credit without socialistic, doctrinaire lectures from  Senator Gietzelt  and the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The picture of the Australian family is one of sturdy <span class="highlight">independence</span>, of people who have been able to handle hire purchase and all the various forms of credit over the years, and to handle them with solvency and with no need for lectures from doctrinaire socialists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He says that the Government is concerned to see that the voluntary conservation movement should be seen to retain its impartiality and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the argument which was raised by  Senator Mason  this morning in regard to the dollar for dollar basis and the statements made in this Senate that voluntary conservation groups should be seen to retain their impartiality and <span class="highlight">independence</span> are concerned, I too say that it is not a matter where we should be expecting groups to spend much of their time in raising money and not doing the work that has to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790927_senate_31_s82/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government unequivocally support the absolute integrity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government taken any special steps, either financially or militarily, to provide extra support for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea, particularly in view of the degree of political instability in Indonesia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is to our credit and to the credit of the Government of Papua New Guinea that, for some considerable time, we have shared an harmonious relationship, unlike many other countries which have been given <span class="highlight">independence</span> and after a short time that <span class="highlight">independence</span> has been lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Premier of Queensland did very little to assist in facing the very difficult problem of establishing some sort of boundary and in recognising the responsibilities which flowed to both nations after <span class="highlight">independence</span> was granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This treaty establishes a zone which enables the Torres Strait island people to maintain their own <span class="highlight">independence</span> and at the same time not be isolated from the peoples of Papua New Guinea with whom they have a very close relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most technology policy has been dictated by France’s political commitment to industrial and technological <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One of the aims of the Government’s federalism policy is that State governments and local authorities should have maximum <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility in determining their priorities and carrying out their functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this sort of section, together with the enhanced penalties both within this Bill and within the Bill with which the Senate dealt earlier in the year, will give to the quarantine service some of the aspects of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and status which are needed to bring home not only to the Australian public but to the magistrates of this country the very great importance of the quarantine service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Richard Kirby and  Mr Justice  Staples are  opposed to  the legislation because they believe it undermines the integrity and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the commission by introducing some procedures and prohibiting others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three comments seem pertinent: the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of a statutory body always is relative; an <span class="highlight">independence</span> that enshrines bias or protects idiosyncratic behaviour is not obviously desirable; and it is arguable that the commission has, in the past, been too willing to pay a high premium on behalf of the Government and the community for industrial peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill is not only destructive of conciliation and arbitration machinery established over many years allowing to commissioners a certain <span class="highlight">independence</span> and impartiality and giving them an effective ability to deal with a dispute; it is also destructive in a much deeper sense of the constitutionally enshrined arrangements for dealing with industrial disputes in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we have the Government pressing on with this legislation in the face of the request by  Sir John  Moore for full consultation on these particular clauses concerning consultation which are perceived by the commissioners as threatening their integrity, their <span class="highlight">independence</span> and their effectiveness in settling disputes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be the conciliation and arbitration system, lt is its <span class="highlight">independence</span> and its integrity which is threatened by this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing is more calculated to strike at the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and authority of any member of the Commission than that he be under threat of becoming disentitled to act if he does not please. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This legislation is setting out to destroy the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is threatening the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission, and the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, as the great divider of this nation, has now tried by this legislation to divide the Commission itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not my purpose to act against my colleague’s stature, rather to uphold his and mine and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This amendment strikes at the concept of judicial <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are aimed at the destruction of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of that system, the erosion of its credibility, the undermining of its selfrespect, and the creation of opportunities for insidious government manipulation of that system for its own purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst complete commercial <span class="highlight">independence</span> may not be possible- it may not even be desirable- I believe  that some move towards this end would certainly add to the efficiency of both organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-165">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee concluded that the Australian Government Publishing Service had made a significant contribution to Commonwealth publishing and recommended that the AGPS should be retained but with greater <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Department of Administrative Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-165">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee also concluded that, in turn, the Government Printer should be given more <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the AGPS and that he should be under the administrative control of the Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services, not the AGPS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-165">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is disappointing that some of the major recommendations relating to the AGPS and the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Government Printer have not been accepted or have been modified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-165">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would seem that in the agreed text, if that is what it is,  Mr Street  deals with  Sir John’s  concern about the consultative process impeding the Commission’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and efficiency by saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is ill drafted, ill thought out, draconian in its implications for unions, and thoroughly nasty in its implications for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the whole conciliation and arbitration system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Constitution provides for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary and its function is to decide the legal matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe it ought to descend to the level of all other quasi-autonomous government organisations- Quangos- or statutory corporations and assume that it has a role and <span class="highlight">independence</span> for itself which overrides the people’s will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Natural justice has also been considered and we believe that it is a quite accepted principle in administrative law that to seek advice on policy matters does not infringe the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nor does the process of the consultation as outlined detract from the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the commissioner and thereby infringe natural justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A letter dated 4 July- American <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Day, incidentally- signed by  Mr Porter  is in an entirely different vein. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Councils are legally able to carry out many of the functions provided by the Public Service administration and establish a greater degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and selfmanagement by raising their own revenues, receiving other public moneys and accepting responsibility for provision of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must remember that at that time  Mr Fraser  and  Mr Anthony  were asking questions in the House of Representatives which were asserting that the <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement in East Timor was Communist influenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Darby,  who is now accused of being a right wing extremist, which he may well be, also defended that position on the basis of his own personal investigations on the island, as, indeed, did  Senator Bonner, Mr Fry  and I when we went to Timor after the Fretilin forces had in fact gained the upper hand in the internal struggle for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, we have  Dr Mochtar,  the Indonesian Foreign Minister, if he is correctly quoted- one can only assume that he is- saying that the reason for the problems of starvation and difficulties in Timor was the Fretilin <span class="highlight">independence</span> movement forcing people away from their villages up into the mountains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even if one could have found a magic formula for providing some degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> in those wasted days of the past, there would have been the need for help to come forward from outside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the general tone right through the report which points out that local government throughout Australia has benefited from the financial and economic plans of the present Government and is enjoying a period of <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility under the Government’s federalism policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the aims and objects of the Government’s federalism policy, as I said earlier, is that State governments and local authorities should have the maximum <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the maximum flexibility in determining their programs and their priorities and in carrying out the various functions which are assigned to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that is very important if the autonomy, <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility of local government is to be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time that belief also supports the policies as well as the philosophy that both State governments and local authorities should have maximum <span class="highlight">independence</span> and flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So at a time when something could have been done on an international level to deal with the future <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Timorese people those who are delivering gratuitous lectures today and who are doing positive damage by so doing were then, in fact, allowing this situation to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  <span class="highlight">independence</span> will disappear and there is no guarantee, despite various Government protestations to the contrary, that he will be able to go on exercising the kind of investigative and noise-making role that he has engaged in since his office was established in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pending the achievement of the objectives of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 concerning the Declaration on the Granting of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the provisions of the present Protocol shall in no way limit the right of petition granted to these peoples by the Charter of the United Nations and other international conventions and instruments under the United Nations and its specialised agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I continually answer questions stressing the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might even go some way to reviving the old concept of implied prohibitions, the notion that the Commonwealth cannot act so as to interfere unwarrantably with the functioning of the States or to threaten their <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States of America had a war of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which was based on the slogan ‘No taxation without representation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But after that there was war and bloodshed for another 150 years, and that was not settled to any great extent until the American Declaration of <span class="highlight">Independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I could come back now to the American Declaration of <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, the undying words were written: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the United States Declaration of <span class="highlight">Independence</span>, and then its Constitution, and then the ten amendments which was actually the United States Bill of Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was the Declaration of the Granting of <span class="highlight">Independence</span> to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1 960. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The occasion for the transfer has been taken to accord to the High Court a measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span> from departmental control that reflects the special position accorded the Court by the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wholly unsatisfactory position has been created if the Government is genuinely serious about preserving the <span class="highlight">independence</span> and the effectiveness, more importantly, of the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think those amendments are really based upon the fact that it is felt that the combination of the present subclauses (l)(c) and (l)(d) creates ambiguity and reflects upon the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Commission to carry out inquiries on its own intiative My proposal to add those words to sub-clause (l)(c) and to delete altogether sub-clause ( 1 ) (d), which does not seem to add anything to the broad powers in sub-clause ( 1 )(c), will overcome some of the concerns which have been expressed and which I think have given rise to  Senator Missen  ‘s amendment and I rather suspect to  Senator Evans’s  amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee aims to establish standard and uniform accountability requirements for authorities and consistent criteria governing their creation and operating <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I reiterate that unless the Parliament ensures the accountability of authorities they are in effect responsible to no-one; neither to the Executive Government from which they have often been given a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> nor, of course, to the taxpayers, who are their real owners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is entitled to draw the conclusion, although I hesitate to do so, that the Bill has three principal purposes: To give the Government more control over land councils in the Northern Territory, both organisationally and financially; to make the actions of the councils accountable to the Government; and to take away more of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the councils, especially the Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation seeks to remove some of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Northern Land Council and to vest even more power in the hands of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 8 shows how the Government has retreated on the important issue of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Northern Land Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gietzelt  looks upon it as instituting more control by government, more control by the Minister; as taking <span class="highlight">independence</span> away from Aboriginal people; as a retreat; and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General put in his second reading speech, and it has been put in debate in the other place, that the overwhelming justification and legitimisation for the new arrangement is the traditional notion of the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the judiciary and, accordingly, the propriety of the judiciary having independent control over finance- it being one of the three major arms of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has long been the subject of complaint- it is currently the subject of quite vociferous complaint by the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and I know that you,  Mr President,  have joined with him in making noise about this matter- that the Parliament does not enjoy any degree of budgetary <span class="highlight">independence</span> from the Government and that this is quite in conflict with Parliament’s standing as an equal arm of government along with the Executive and the judiciary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is absolutely nothing in this legislation which can be construed as guaranteeing any ultimate financial <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every court and tribunal, at whatever level, should surely be able to be independent and to make an argument for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has to be read in conjunction with the provision that the High Court is to be given administrative <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of the High Court’s having administrative <span class="highlight">independence</span>- it is the same privilege as is accorded to independent statutory authorities- is that it does not have to obtain ministerial or departmental approval for the contracts or expenditures it enters into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today we had before us a Bill which virtually gave complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> of operation to the High Court of Australia, to the judicial arm of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns me greatly that the positions occupied by the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives should be treated in such a cavalier way, immediately after a Bill has been presented which gives practically complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> to the judicial arm of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those things that I ‘ve said are on the basis that they relate to the adherence to principles of <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Courts and indeed the criticism that I most strongly make is that it cuts across the time honoured principle, that not only must justice be done, but that it must also appear to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They promised their electorates that they would come into the Parliament and perform their functions with a measure of <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that very day, this Parliament agreed to the passage of the High Court legislation which virtually gave the High Court complete <span class="highlight">independence</span> as to its financial operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The national Parliament is to meet on 28 November to elect a Chief Minister and to form a new government which will decide the date for <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looks forward to the completion of the New Hebrides’ progress towards <span class="highlight">independence</span> and to an expansion of relations between the two countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we would expect the British and French governments, as the administrating authorities and, in the future, as the former metropolitan powers, to meet the major aid requirements of the New Hebrides, just as we have provided the major aid needs of Papua New Guinea since its <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that the British have indicated that subventions of this magnitude, reducing at 6 per cent per annum, will continue in the postindependence period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ASEAN pledges its firm support and solidarity with the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand and the Thai people in meeting the threat to their security and in the preservation of their <span class="highlight">independence</span>, national sovereignty and territorial integrity; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a new development which ultimately will lead to <span class="highlight">independence</span> from Government funding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our amendments are designed to strengthen the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of the Institute and give it more direction and substance than we believe the legislation before us does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would be fearful that an institute set up with such rigid government control and lack of <span class="highlight">independence</span> might fall into the same trap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important if we are going to establish an institute like this that we give it <span class="highlight">independence</span> and strength and that we divorce it as much as possible from departmental control or departmental direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am prompted also by the fact that there has been a move for Timor <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-114-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new movement seeking <span class="highlight">independence</span> for the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, now incorporated into Indonesia, launched a Press campaign in the Portuguese capital at the weekend . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-114-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of East Timor to self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1 5 1 4 ( XV); <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-116-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact remains that Indonesia exploited the situation and endeavoured to undermine the desire the Timorese had for political <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-116-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been given a degree of <span class="highlight">independence</span> which is very substantial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-125-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">independence</span> is given to enable the Board to fulfil a public function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-125-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that <span class="highlight">independence</span> is given on a basis that the Board will be accountable through the Parliament to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-125-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no basis at all upon which authorities can be created, can have <span class="highlight">independence</span>, but not be accountable to the Parliament which has created them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-125-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to an article in the Melbourne  Age  this morning which states that the United Nations General Assembly voted yesterday to reaffirm the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination and <span class="highlight">independence</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Government taken any special steps, financially or militarily, to provide extra support for the <span class="highlight">independence</span> of Papua New Guinea, particularly in view of the degree of political instability in Indonesia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to a reported decision of the Papua New Guinea Government to postpone a scheduled 1976 election for one year, which in effect would postpone <span class="highlight">Independence</span> Day? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the government will take all steps to acquaint the people with the dangers of nuclear warfare and to work internationally for nuclear disarmament and that it will refuse to diminish Australia’s <span class="highlight">independence</span> and standing through the construction of an Omega station in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it had embarked upon that course it could not be accused of interfering in the freedom and <span class="highlight">independence</span> of universities, as it will be accused as a result of this statement and the legislation which, presumably, is to follow in the Budget session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
