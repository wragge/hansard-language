    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: In his recent investigation of the role of housing corporations in migrant sponsorship in Western Australia was he aware that the complaints referred to were investigated by the then Labor State Government two or more years ago and that the State Labor Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> concluded that the scheme provided a useful service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: Is government <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy designed to prevent a person who was established to have been an anti-Jewish propagandist and a Nazi collaborator during the Second World War and who was regarded as a war criminal by the Government of Yugoslavia and the War Crimes Documentation Centre in Vienna from entering Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has indicated to me that he wishes to make a personal explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I desire to ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Government is concerned at any diminution in the assisted migration programme from Great Britain because British migration has been, and we would wish it to continue to be, the cornerstone of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in summary I say to the right honourable gentleman and to the House that we are determined that migration from the United Kingdom should continue to be the cornerstone of our total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and that steps are being taken to realise this objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700303_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preliminary discussions leading up to the Agreement were held in Canberra and Belgrade between representatives of the two Governments, including a thorough discussion on main principles by my colleague the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden),  when, as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, he visited Belgrade in December 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian delegation comprised representatives of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Department of External Affairs, the Attorney-General’s Department, the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Social Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the usual practice on agreements affecting <span class="highlight">immigration</span> the text of the Agreement was referred to all six State governments and each signified that it had no objection to the signature of the Agreement as proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been basic to Australia’s post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that the right to determine who may be admitted to Australia for permanent settlement rests with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As with all other countries from which migrants are taken, Yugoslavia has a legitimate and reasonable interest in the number and occupational categories of those moving to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition welcomes the signing of this Agreement which has been outlined in some detail by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Agreement also represents, as the Minister has said, a completely new depature by the Government in furtherance of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme in that it is the first agreement with a Communist country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been and, I hope, generally will be full and constructive support of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme by both sides of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that there will be a shortage of skilled personnel in the coal mining industry in the next 18 months or so, and perhaps the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> could have a look at this and get some skilled miners out from Great Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While 1 concede that all members on the other side do not sympathise with the attitude of this particular group - and I commend the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  for his question to the Prime Minister on Tuesday - it seems to me that there is an attitude of racial superiority prevalent amongst some honourable members on the other side that is demonstrated in the Government policies toward South East Asia - in particular Vietnam - towards New Guinea with its paternalistic colonialism, its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and its inability to carry out a concerted attack on the question of Aboriginal advancement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought that the honourable member for Dawson would have been aware that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is also the Minister Assisting the Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed at the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, 1 think the importance of the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  has been completely overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  has pointed out, the fact is that the interest rate is 5%. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The questions that we have raised concerning the matter of interest cannot be discarded in the way in which the honourable member for Maltee, the  Deputy  Whip of the Liberal Party, the honourable member lor Angas and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  have attempted to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch),  who is also the Minister assisting the Treasurer, has said that the interest rate today is  5%. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alternatively, perhaps he could have the Australian subsidised dredges operate in cooperation with the South Korean dredge, provided that the Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> allows the work to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we spend - and must spend - large sums of money on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> there is an even more urgent need to assist the large family that is already here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the statistics which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has given are correct, the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme of which we boast - and rightly so - is a concealed failure because apparently there are more abortions than there are people coming into this country, after deducting the number of departing migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700311_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in mind that an imaginative distribution of programmes such as these might well have some appeal for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Snedden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for Papua and New Guinea was a long standing one based on the need to avoid the sort of problem which has arisen in other developing countries over the admission of alien racial groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two men are involved and we cannot see the application of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy to their appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then to issue a statement that a <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy applied to the man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other explanation related to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We of the Opposition are disturbed at the attitude that appears to have been shown in this matter; we are disturbed at the damage that has taken place to the reputations of these two men; we are disturbed at the unintelligibility of renewing  Mr Idris’s  permit for 1 year only when the University has reappointed him for 3 years; and we are disturbed about the use of expressions such as ‘<span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy’ and ‘it is an obligation on Australia, as the trustee, not to saddle Papua and New Guinea with problems of Australia’s making’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government hopes to be able to offset the present population situation by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700317_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and by way of explanation I refer to the entry to and departure from Australia of  Mr Wilfred  Burchett without an Australian passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the final part of the honourable member’s question is concerned - it related to the value of an Australian passport - I want to say quite clearly to the House that the value of an Australian passport is that it identifies the bearer and his citizenship to representatives of other governments, to our own representatives overseas, to carriers, to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials at ports and airports on entry to Australia, and to this extent it is valuable because it greatly facilitates the travel of the bearer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government goes all out to people the cities, with its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, but then washes its hands of what is to become of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase in our labour resource by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, announced recently by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  at 180,000 this year, is regarded as the greatest rate of increase which this country can satisfactorily absorb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700318_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it correct, as reported in yesterday’s edition of the Sydney ‘Sun’, that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in London are telling plumbers that they will live a life of luxury if they migrate to Australia where all plumbers drive big American cars? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally I ask the Minister: If he is not in a position to answer my question now, will he initiate an immediate investigation into the allegations made in the newspaper article, and, at the same time, make available to all <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers, regardless of where they  aTe  stationed, up to date copies of the major Australian industrial awards in order that intending migrants can be advised correctly as to the Australian wages and working conditions applicable to their particular trade or calling? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>374)  “  Mr Scholes  asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a decision been made on the proposal to establish a permanent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office in Geelong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recent review of the service required and provided in Geelong indicated that current arrangements are adequate for the amount of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> business in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1964 Geelong has been serviced by an information office located in the city and staffed on Thursday of each week by an <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officer from Melbourne, lt is proposed to continue this service until it is shown to be inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700319_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-51-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the honourable member for Chisholm, the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in effect apologised for having to follow United Nations resolutions on Rhodesian passports and said that there was certainly regret on his part in having to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may know how insignificant is his position as  chairman  of the Liberal Party’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all cases normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requirements of health and character must be met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Norfolk Island has a new <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Ordinance which permits entry for periods of up to 30 days without having firstly to apply for an entry permit  provided a return or  onward ticket is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700408_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-29-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that not also the case with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it a fact that immigrants are encouraged to believe that naturalisation will entitle them to all the privileges of Australian citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 firmly believe that the Minister, not the Secretary, should have the final word, as is the case, for example, with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> referrals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I desire to bring to the attention of the House a matter concerned with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have kept closely in touch with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme over the years, not only because of my own interest as the Minister who first planned the post-war intake of migrants but more particularly because of its vital importance to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubtless these points have been fully weighed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  in reaching his decision, but I. sincerely hope that he has not been unduly swayed by a desire to save money because in the long term this could not eventuate, particularly if the returnee rate increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  has a deserved reputation in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, the new arrangements recently negotiated by this Government, and for which I accept responsibility as the Minister responsible for this portfolio, will involve, firstly, a change of sea contractor; secondly, the increased use of air transport by Qantas but no actual commitment to total air movement in the future; thirdly, the preservation of a choice of sea transport for those who prefer it; fourthly, a considerable saving in transport costs; and finally, in my own view and in the view of the most senior officers of my Department in Canberra with whom I have been in close consultation and of officers overseas with whom I have been in telephonic communication, no adverse effect will result to the total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 preface my question to the Minister for Social Services by reminding him that yesterday the honourable member for Perth asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether he was aware of the concern and resentment of elderly migrants who found that, in spite of naturalisation, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years and he referred to their complaints of being treated as second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already mentioned that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been responsible for the establishment of embassies in certain countries to suit its needs notwithstanding that there may be no other adequate reasons for having posts in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those we call our allies are aware of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that excludes most of those with coloured skin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether his attention has been drawn to a recent article in a South Australian newspaper quoting  Mr Giordano,  publisher of a monthly bulletin, as saying that more should be done in the field of housing for migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700421_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-30-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to raise a matter with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claims that on one occasion about  12  months ago, or a little more, two officials from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and a third party interviewed him and questioned him for nearly  2  hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It transpired during the course of the interview that the third party with the two <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officials was allegedly an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation agent and that this ASIO agent informed  Mr Vorstman  that if he was prepared to become an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation - that is an informer on the Communist Party, on political activity and on general radical movements in the community - this would favourably influence the outcome of his application for Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be highly undesirable for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to be working hand in glove in this way with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it would be even more undesirable that an ASIO agent in company with officials of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should be in a position to say to  Mr Vorstman  or to any other person seeking Australian citizenship that although he was having difficulty and had been having difficulty for some time in obtaining Australian citizenship a more favourable attitude might very well develop on the part of officialdom if that person became an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> repeatedly replies to  Mr Vorstman  in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  or any other Minister in the Government - not even that great democrat who looks after the Department of External Territories - has not a right to deprive a person of citizenship in this country if he meets normal requirements and standards which are not regarded as illegal if they are held by other Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-32-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question which relates to an answer that I received recently to a question placed on the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave -  Mr Speaker,  one of the major new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> initiatives to be taken by the Government in the course of this Parliament is in the area of migrant education - an area vital to the effective integration of migrants into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  has been good enough to outline to the Parliament proposals dealing with migrant education to which he will give legislative effect in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposal is a forward step in the fulfilment of our ideals and aspirations in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is true not only in Australia but in other countries with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased also to note that evidently the Minister and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are taking note of submissions made in this Parliament and at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> conventions, and by interested organisations, about the need for something to be done in the field of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that a survey by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> indicated that about one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English and that departmental English classes assist only a small proportion of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the assurance of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that he will not curtail the debate when it takes place, within reason, I will content myself with saying that we on this side of the House will welcome the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has thrown a great burden on the States and on education in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to bring before the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  an immediate problem in regard to the Chester Hill Public School which is adjacent to the Villawood migrant hostel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700423_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-16-7">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> stood on a platform and behind him was a picture of a famous Nazi Party leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is now somewhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and the growth in the number of young people, the demand for homes will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coupled with growth policies of full employment, particularly in the cities where most manufacturing industries are located, the high level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and these inflationary characteristics are virtually wrecking many of the unprotected rural industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to a report of the plight of an English migrant family in Pascoe Vale, Victoria, which it is claimed has been refused accommodation in a hostel by the Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 desire to address a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has long been a general rule in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cases that the specific reasons for the refusal to grant a visa should not be disclosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  that it was my purpose to mention this matter tonight but he has not returned to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regular studies are carried out on the returnee rale by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question arising from the clause in the migration agreement with Yugoslavia which provides that Yugoslav migrants will not be called up for military service in Australia if they are 20 years and 1 month or more at the time when they arrive in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the same type of provision could be included in future agreements made with countries concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700515_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  is overseas on government business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where I use the personal pronoun it should bc taken to mean the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and not me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I take the opportunity to express my personal congratulations to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for developing this programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The short title - <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act 1970 - indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> provision in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee will include representatives from State Education Departments as well as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Education and Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 8 provides authority for the conduct of such research which will be undertaken by the Department of “ <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Education and Science in conjunction with the research units of the State Education Departments and of appropriate tertiary institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause II indicates that the funds required from time to time will be provided under the annual appropriations for the Department  of  <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700519_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address a question to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, fs the Minister aware that in the first 3 months of this year 30,000-odd Americans, which represents an increase of over 30%, have made inquiries about the possibility of migrating to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be wrong, and it would not indicate any lack of support for our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problem, if a committee of the standing of the Vernon Committee were set up to inquire into the economic value and the economic cost of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia and to make recommendations on any alterations that are necessary, for economic reasons, to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as has been claimed by the professor, we are spending about $4,000 on each migrant in social costs - not actual dollars - then it would not be a bad idea if we had statistical and economic data provided to show us the absolute value of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, I believe we would have to consider, as referred to earlier by the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  the proposition that we would have to look at some of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> quotas and decide what is the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target we need most of all in order to integrate migrant intake with the other aspects of our economic planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is determined to pursue its policy of continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A couple of weeks ago the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  claimed great credit and announced with a very great flourish that the Government would be bringing in about 180,000 immigrants a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme with its many social problems, the international scene, the need for members and senators to be freely available throughout their electorates, the increased cost of travel, population increases, larger electorates, the needs for members of Parliament to be informed electorally and on the Territories of the Commonwealth all present heavy demands on time and money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700521_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to statements made by the newly arrived Japanese Consul criticising visa regulations applying to Japanese tourists, and to statements by Japanese business.ment about restrictions under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws on Japanese interests establishing industries in Australia and providing workers and executives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, in view of the obvious misunderstanding of the position, will he state the facts to the House and give assurance that the Japanese are treated no worse and no better than other nationals under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there are any reasonable complaints on the part of consular officials, 1 am sure that the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will do what they can to eliminate the cause for these complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the obvious need for the Australian States to establish a Federal government responsible for defence, external affairs, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and other matters, in which Commonwealth influence is becoming progressively greater, I believe that few problems could have influenced the founders of federation more than the hotchpotch of railway systems of that time, with various gauges in various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700522_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only yesterday, the Minister for Housing who, by an ironical coincidence, currently is acting also as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, was good enough to send to me a circular advising - to use her own words ‘with pleasure’ - that Australia was set this year to exceed the migrant intake target of 175,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700604_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Prime Minister aware that the basic reasons for the introduction of Australia’s excellent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy by the Chifley Labor Government in 1946 and continued by successive Liberal governments, are considered by many people to be no longer applicable to Australia in the 1970s? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now, there is a realisation that population pressures must be controlled by family planning and birth control measures, and that if family planning is successful, the pressures on migration will become less and the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, looking at it from our point of view, will be more widely understood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the honourable gentleman will appreciate that provision for repatriation has been a feature of Australia’s post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and that provision for repatriation is included in a number of bi-lateral agreements which have been signed since the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although undoubtedly this item is a financial debit to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, I say quite deliberately that it is a debit generated from a sense of compassion and a realisation that, of the hundreds of thousands of people who come to Australia year in and year out, there will be some who for very good reasons will be quite able to conform to conditions here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very small expense indeed when measured against the tremendous advantages to Australia of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme since its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other factors are the high levels of consumption generated by the high wages and salaries that are paid; the present rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which imposes further pressures and demands; the degree of protection accorded the secondary industries, protecting their costs of production from overseas competition and protecting the high levels of employment; and, another factor not often mentioned, the fixed exchange rate which is creating an unrealistic, insulated, high internal cost structure and inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to prices, government policy and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that between 1961 and 1966 the population of Australia increased by 1 million - 487,000 coming from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - while the rural population of Australia declined by 65,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for the year 1968-69 was $61,835,007; in 1969-70 it was $67,925,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That includes the cost of the administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the bringing of migrants to Australia, lt has been suggested that the cost of each migrant is about $10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last days of the previous session I asked the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  whether he would call for a re-evaluation of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in the light of doubts expressed across the broad spectrum of public opinion as to its efficacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one extraordinary response came from an unexpected quarter in an article which appeared in the ‘Bulletin’ of 8th August under the heading The Great <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Cave-in’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This incredibly illinformed, unresearched, deliberately misleading and mischievous article, the author of which not surprisingly preferred to remain anonymous, referred to questioners of the sacred cow of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as ‘a melange of academics, commentators and low ranking politicians’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This unknown author dismissed our fears of overcrowded cities, pollution, lack of conservation, inadequate social services and shortage of schools and hospitals as just a matter of planning and priorities, entirely ignoring the fact that had there been this sort of planning and priorities the debate about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> may never have commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article concluded by quoting representatives of migrant organisations who publicly welcome the inquiry announced recently by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  but who in private are said to be ‘incredulous, scornful, angry and disgusted’ by what they regard as an attack on immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have been greatly heartened by the announcement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that he proposes a comprehensive investigation into the effects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, ils aims and objects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the survey proposed by the Department will include a cost benefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, desirable populations levels for Australia and the effect that increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will have on our environment and urban problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is to be complimented on his response to recent public disquiet over the effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, lt is a measure of his flexibility and sensitivity that he has been prepared to initiate such a comprehensive inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to thank him for the courtesy he has shown me by inviting me to discuss with him privately my reservations about <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have a strong suspicion that it may be not as objective an analysis as it should be but an attempt to prove that increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is desirable, lt would have been better, in my view, if the analysis were done by a body of experts outside the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ardent advocates of increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have been quick to rush to the defence of the present policy and have actually called for the Government to up the ante. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organisations such as the Chambers of Manufactures, which have never been known for their humanitarian concern for the plight of the under-priviliged, nor for that matter for anything but their own profits, have been in the forefront of those urging increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hysterica] outbursts of late by the traditional supporters of the Liberal Party - the employers’ organisations - against unions, blaming them, together with over-full employment, for the inflationary spiral, is hardly conducive to an objective assessment of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that this survey will allow us lo examine more closely the cost of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Estimates, outside the direct cost of $77m that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has budgeted for, are so varied as to make any effective analysis or final evaluation little more than guesswork. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1945 when the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Honourable Arthur Calwell, introduced a programme to bring migrants to Australia in vast numbers the population of Australia was a little over 7 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To fully understand my reasons for seeking a review of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy 1 think we need to examine the basic philosophies behind the present policies to see if they are still valid for Australia of the 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one whose prime motivation in entering politics was to try to break down the prejudices between peoples of different race, religion, class, colour, culture and nationalities, 1 regard the new broadening of the Australian’s attitude towards people who are different as the greatest single contribution by the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker,  you may well ask: If I am so enamoured of our past programme of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> why then am 1 now questioning that same policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would probably argue that the Government no longer puts forward this theory as one of the reasons for continued and expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The final argument against any slowdown or cut back in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is based on the ‘economies of scale of production theory’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What those who ask for a re-examination want is not necessarily an end to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but an end to open ended programmes without goals or objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This requires heavy investment in social overhead capital - housing, services, roads, schools and hospitals - although it is often overlooked that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> also increases the total resources available for investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many economists argue that we could improve our standard of living by cutting back the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only does <span class="highlight">immigration</span> make possible technical and financial economies of scale; it also provides us with a more flexible, mobile and adaptable work force; it generates new skills, know-how and entrepreneurship; and it acts as a spur to technological innovation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional areas  of  assistance to industry and expenditure  on  the Territories, education, the Austraiian Broadcasting Commission, Aboriginals, research and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - all of which I believe are essential items of expenditure which the Government must undertake - represent 10% of the proposed total Budget expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This growth has been in the main accelerated by the establishment of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy by the then Labor Government and its continuation over the years by a succession of coalition governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>His  place in our history is assured as our first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy critical to the prosperity, development and security of Australia in the 50’s was equally admirably suited to our requirements in the 60’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 consider the problems that have been revealed in recent years in relation to migration have developed, not simply as some suggest, because of the continuation of the policy, but rather because of the inability of recent Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to adapt the policy to what may be most readily, although perhaps not most suitably, described as the principles of supply and demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The announcement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  that a review of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is to be undertaken is most timely but 1 suspect it was not very well considered before being determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Population increases in the urban areas also result from natural increase, and from the movement of native-born persons to urban areas as well as from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth is designed, inter alia, to help State Governments cope with the increasing demand for State services occasioned by the growth in population whether from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or natural increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the remarks that I made last evening before the adjournment of the House I referred to an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inquiry as being a departmental inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  has advised me that that statement was incorrect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even Commonwealth departments like the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Social Services have but a nominal skeleton staff of trained social workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has not even taken into account the problems which have been caused by our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, particularly as it affects these schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  mentioned this afternoon that we were about third in the world in the giving of external aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We look down the list at the Post Office, defence and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  in answer to a question today put forward a similar proposition in respect of visas for visitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the question of a release became a matter with which the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> concerned itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was unable to get that release from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, firstly, ostensibly on the basis that he could not be enrolled anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wrote on 10th February to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Sydney, suggesting a release. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got that letter in June after the boy himself had received a letter not from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but from the coaching college which he had left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With its whole weight the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> says: ‘We will not release you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then sought an interview with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  but he was overseas - we can understand that - and would not be back until July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It  is not the function of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department to say: ‘Because they will not release you we will not release you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be useless my trying to make representations to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department in Sydney in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is appropriate to draw to the attention of the House that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities should be concerned with one thing only - that entry in proper circumstances is allowed and that at the appropriate stage the person concerned is able to leave the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reported the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 cannot believe that this is the action of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, a man whom, in the short time I have been here, 1 have grown to respect, a man whom I believe to be a small ‘1’ liberal and a man whom I have praised on other matters in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The justification for this appears, as far as I can see, in the speech delivered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I still believe that we can control inflation by proper integration of our policies’ on tariffs, subsidies, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, investment, education and profit and price control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch),  who comes from somewhere in the Melbourne area, might even spend his weekends by the side of a swimming pool. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he so inform the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in connection with his refusal to grant a visa to  Mr Gregory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether it is a fact that he or any other Australian citizen on a visit to countries such as Italy can fly there and back without hindrance from Australian quarantine laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact is that a member has not the time to read them for the simple reason that by the time he has dealt with constituency matters - social services, telephone complaints, complaints about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the like - there is no time left to undertake the study, research and reading that he should be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our population from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> alone has increased by at least 3 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the major financial difficulties of State governments flow directly from the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, whereby it spends more than S50m a year to bring migrants here only to dump them mercilessly, relentlessly and unceremoniously into the laps of State governments to nurture, house, educate and employ them, without any consideration for the ability or otherwise of the authorities which must of necessity be the final link in a migrant’s rehabilitation in his new country - the local government authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I teel heartwarmed by the concluding remarks of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, so far as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is concerned, I believe that its officers should be congratulated if this migrant is the type of citizen selected - healthy, ageless and so confident that he will live long enough to share in the welfare state of liberalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  wife is the daughter of a late Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales who was also the Vice-Chairman of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) The ‘total cost’ to Australia for each migrant involves expenditure extending beyond the annual budget ofthe Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and because of its complexity, no authoritative estimate of the account has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the direct costs of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme over the past 25 years,’ during which time some 2.6 million settlers have come to Australia, average out at about $285 a head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in fact, an important purpose of the cost-benefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for which I have arranged, on the recommendation of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The expenditure for 1969-70 shown underItem 330/4/08 of Appropriation Bill No.1 1970-71 covers two distinct <span class="highlight">immigration</span> schemes - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) Table 12, page 52 in the Budget document Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure for year ending 30th June 1971, provides the expenditure recorded against appropriations under the control of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for 1969-70 and the estimated requirements for 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amounts shown in Table 12 represent the expenditure by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> under Division 332 for maintaining its various overseas offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-59">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister is expected to return to Australia on 30th September, and during his absence the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  is Acting Minister for the Army. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to the story, the Leader of the Opposition had claimed that the News and Information Bureau’s role was to promote <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, tourism and trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in consultation with and as required by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to prepare or assist in the preparation of general publicity and information material to serve as a background against which specific campaigns to attract and inform immigrants can be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We still have a record <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inflow compared with that of any other country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a resolution adopted by the annual convention of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should operate a more effective system of screening and selection to limit the arrival of undesirable migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether he has seen the Hobart newspaper report which says that an Australian citizen, Con  Patiniotis,  on holiday with his family in Greece was inducted into the Greek Army despite assurances from the Greek authorities that he would not have to serve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> proceeds to answer, I remind all honourable members that 1 will not have points of order taken or personal explanations made in this House for political purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question which is to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> by referring to a resolution adopted by the annual convention of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party that the Department off <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should operate a more effective system of screening and selection in order to limit the arrival of undesirable migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I am unaware of the reasons which were advanced for it but I want to observe that over a quarter of a century in which Australia has had experience in the promotion of a high level <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme our record in relation to selection and assessment of the 2.6 million migrants who have come to this country post- 1945 has been very good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the reports we have received of the incidence of mental illness and crime among migrants; of the reports that we have received on migrant youth; of the fact that the Australian system has been well commended by international authorities in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>; of the fact that our experience has been sought by other countries with high level <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes, and finally of the fact that 2.6 million people who have come here in the post-war period have with some difficulties been effectively integrated into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say to the honourable member and to the House that this is not a question on which one can take any position of complacency because undoubtedly, in view of the fact that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a difficult experience and because of the human factor, mistakes have been made in the past and will no doubt continue to be made in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister described the programme in his publication <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Seventies’ in these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I could go further and say that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme ranks as one of the great achievements of our time and is acknowledged as such by people of all shades of politics and thought in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  who was sworn in on 1 3 th July 1945 during the time of the Chifley Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, according to a document issued by the first Minister at a later date, commenced with about 24 officers, 6 stationed in Canberra, 6 more in Melbourne and about 12 located in London, engaged almost exclusively in making arrangements for the British wives and children of Australian servicemen to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 17 th September 1970, in answer to a question I had directed to him the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> advised me that arrivals under the United Kingdom assisted passage scheme increased from 1,960 for the January-June period in 1947 to 69,035 in 1969-70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently the Minister announced the terms of a far reaching inquiry into all the ramifications of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme not, as he said, to curtail migration but rather, as he put it, to study certain aspects and allied matters that he mentioned to me in a letter which was just an endorsement of what he had already put out publicly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A comprehensive review of the benefits and cost to Australia of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> conducted on traditional patterns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of authorities on urbanisation and environment as consultants on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convinced that increased population is vitalto the future development of Australia, the Australian Labor Party will support and uphold a vigorous and expanding <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times criticism has been made by some sections of the community of the demands of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on our economic capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not an unusual pattern because similar criticism was offered by critics of sustained <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as long as a century ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister in his publication ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Seventies’ quoted interesting figures on the migrant contribution to our economic welfare which should be studied by all people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has not stated any individual names except those appointed to certain <span class="highlight">immigration</span> committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme owes its success amongst other things to the united support of most of the major political parties of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this background I suggest to the Minister that in the interests of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and its further this inquiry should have been conducted by an all-party parliamentary commitee from both Houses of the National Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, tonight, I think the honourable member for Grayndler gave us a very reasoned and studied approach to the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think that his suggestion of an all party committee to look into the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is something that is well worth considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is just over 25 years since Australia’s post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme came into operation and it is interesting to note that, at this time, we are hearing criticism of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one journalist wrote recently: Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been taken out of the sacred cow category and subjected to increasing criticism’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  has been aware of this type of criticism for some time, and recently, as the honourable member for Grayndler said, the Minister announced that the Government would undertake a full scale review of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present scheme was introduced by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  when he was Minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the Chifley Government, and it has been continued by succeeding Liberal and Country Party Governments.I think it is a matter for some pride, that Australia has absorbed some 2.6 million migrants since 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has existed for only a quarter of a century, Australia has gained much over its two century history from migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> started in Australia when the first 850 people landed at Sydney Cove in  1788,  and it has been said that the history of Australia has been the history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of us in this House, are either immigrants ourselves, or descendants of immigrants, so that we might say that Australia’s growth and economic strength have been founded on its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to read a. recent statement by the Minister that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia would continue at a high level and that some 2 million new residents could come to Australia in the 1970’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those of us who have been bom in this country do not have to look far to see what <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has contributed in so many ways to what we have now come to accept as the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But our restricted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is not based on any theory of racial superiority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is directed to maintaining a predominantly homogeneous population, mainly because we would not like to see Australia become the breeding ground of racial prejudice and hatred such as we are witnessing in America and England today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most countries have a restricted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for varying reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for moral reasons as well as those of national security, let us not slacken in our efforts to expand this wonderful country by continuing our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My reason for saying that is that it would seem that everybody at this point of time, including myself, is agreed on the proposition that there should be an investigation into our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Deakin also spoke about the history of Australia as being the history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and if I may I will recapitulate a little of the history of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, since the inception of Australia, has gone through a number of phases in our relatively short history of 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And Australia’s first <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme was off the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could say without fear of contradiction that this, our first <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, was the result of a planned policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The others were carefully selected for their qualities and the selections were confirmed by some of the finest judges in England, litis planned <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy continued for a number of years with the immigrants being housed in cosy little migrant hostels at Port Arthur in the south, at Botany Bay on the east coast and Moreton Bay in the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia then entered a phase of unplanned <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not the least of these is in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chifley’s  inherent ability to find the right man for the right job led him to choose the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  as he now is, to institute an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, in spite of the changed circumstances, succeeding governments, and the various and numerous succeeding Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, including the present Government and the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch),  are still following the guidelines laid down by my colleague the right honourable member for Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has become a matter of public debate and the general concensus would be that the policy needs review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 repeat that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is in need ot review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard various descriptions of the position, but the one that I like best and thought: most appropriate was the heading for an article in the ‘Australian’ in May of this year which described our policy as ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: A horse that has run wild’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The article puts forward a point of view that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a cost to the community because it draws on resources that could be applied to other things and that there is not sufficient return to the community to warrant a continued outlay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will make its first full scale review of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a starting point, he had earlier  this  year approved a cost-benefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>: This project, would provide detailed information on the economics of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Lynch also said that he had decided to broaden the basis of Australia’s consultative machinery on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he had decided to widen the functions and membership of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council to include urbanisation and environmental considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> today is at a crossroads and the choice of which road to take is one the Government must face up to fairly quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is of such vital importance that Australia’s policy warrants full debate in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know and can measure how much money is spent and charged against the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department and we know by book-keeping which areas cost what. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is generally agreed that the ledger has shown a credit balance in favour of increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunate and condemnatory thai the Government, which has been in office for 20 years, has realised at the eleventh hour that there is a need for reason rather than emotion to frame our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rising to speak in support of the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I first of all want to pay a tribute to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had many very good Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but the present Minister has brought drive and enthusiasm to this portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, together with the hard work of his Department, augurs well for the future of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who has been associated with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ever since I came into the Parliament I pay a tribute to the tremendous job they do and their keenness to co-operate with honourable members irrespective of party affiliations in every way and on every occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly Australia’s record in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a very proud one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It compares more than favourably with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> records of other nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because of our efficient <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and the thoroughness with which we have attempted to assimilate these people that the great majority of them have become very good Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been accusations, as I have said before, that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy perhaps has aggravated unduly the trend towards inflation and rising costs, but we must balance that against what we have gained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been exceedingly successful, principally because we have moved with the times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, the whole of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been aimed increasingly at making it possible for all the people we are bringing to Australia to become Australians as quickly as possible, to he assimilated and integrated into the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is a story of increasing success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the proposed expenditure for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have pointed out that for 25 years <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been a major item of Commonwealth Government expenditure and that 2.6 million new settlers have been the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the honourable member for Deakin  (Mr Jarman)  and the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  pointed out that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> history is a much longer one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Deakin pointed out that the number of migrants we have received in modern times have given us a lead over the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rate that even (he United States of America achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was very much impressed in the United States to see the museum of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that has been set up at the base of the Statue of Liberty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that a proper <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme must have a basis of and work towards ensuring Australia’s national and economic security, the welfare and integration of all its citizens and the balanced development of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I compliment the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  and his Department because I believe they possess the same sort of principles and believe in a questioning of the proper role of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has initiated major examinations of aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The staff of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been most helpful and understanding in any cases I have put before it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Minister has assured the House that the numbers refused naturalisation for political reasons were small, I am very concerned with the development of this view among migrants under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> plan, particularly amongst such a very responsible group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to refer to a speech made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the Metal Trades Industry Assocation in Melbourne on 30th July of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that Australians understand what can and what cannot reasonably be asked of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span>’s essential role in these areas is to supplement and reinforce other lines of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do however believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is being let down in other areas of Commonwealth Government administration, or perhaps the Minister fails to convince his colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not intended as an alternative to adequate industrial and occupational training facilities, if it does not absolve us from our responsibility to train professional, skilled and other key workers, then the complete lack of forward long term Australian objectives in education and quality of education, which was highlighted in the recent debate on the estimates for the Department of Education and Science, should not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers overseas, particularly in countries sending large numbers to Australia, can and do start this process from the time the first approaches are made, wherever practicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps after 25 years the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should not only be concerned with just mere money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these and other reasons we have had a sustained <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme since the end of the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this aspect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy was a valid one, and still is, though perhaps to a lesser extent today when military technology has, to a certain degree at least, overcome the advantages previously enjoyed by sheer numbers of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is in the increase of our economic strength that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has had its most easily measurable impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, cultural benefits have also been derived from our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That there are problems and costs associated with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme nobody denies, and I would like to look at some of the criticisms that have been raised, lt has been said that not enough use has been made of many skilled personnel who emigrate to Australia and I believe that in some cases this is and has been the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention the convertibility of qualifications and I believe it is to the credit of the Department of Labour and National Service that it has undertaken the task of compiling a guide to European technical qualifications and their approximate equivalent here, lt is also a tribute to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that in 1969 it established a committee on overseas professional qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some other aspects of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which have disturbed me in the past but I believe that steps which have recently been taken will do much to overcome criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I firmly believe our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should be based on the needs of this country, the availability of suitable migrants and the capacity of the Australian community to integrate migrants into our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is aware of these problems and by the provision of migrant educational services, social workers, welfare officers, trained contact workers, together with a host of voluntary workers, it does much to reduce the problems of migrants in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Research into desirable future population levels together with the structure and distribution of the population within Australia can only be of great assistance in assessing desirable levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cost-benefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and time span surveys of migrants during their early years will provide much needed back-up data and disclose avenues for further initiative in the selection and integration of settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of authorities on urbanisation and environment to the Migration Planning Council can only add to the effectiveness of this Council and, together with the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Publicity Council, it will act as a source of good advice to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approach adopted by the Minister and his Department, particularly the efforts quantitatively and qualitatively to assess the selection procedures, desirable intake levels, assimilation procedures, and contribution of new settlers will do much to answer the questions of those who view our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy with some suspicion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This important fact is in no small way a tribute to my colleague, the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  who was Australia’s first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the years since its commencement our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has had the support of both sides of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that all honourable members look forward to a continuation of this general agreement in future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I point out that probably the first occasion on which this Government implemented our policy was in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our policy has been quoted this evening during this debate by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has been administered in the past in a way that has met with the approval of all political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen),  questioned the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on the effectiveness of the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, even though it was very early in the day, during question time, the Prime Minister missed the point of the question and answered that he did not realise that any members of Parliament thought that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy was bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the credit of the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  that he has recently ordered a searching inquiry of Australia’s future migration needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to support the proposition put so capably this evening by the honourable member for Grayndler on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that the most suitable type of inquiry to investigate the future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs of our nation is, without a doubt, a joint committee of both Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this Convention I heard a number of very interesting matters associated with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other parts of the world we find, for example, that after the formation of Israel in 1948 the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake reached 239,000 per annum in 1949 on a base population of only 800,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, attention has already been drawn to the fact that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in Australia appears to be at the crossroads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may say so without undue congratulation, I think our Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  is characteristically attuned to the tempo of the times in that he has inaugurated or is inaugurating a fairly wide ranging series of investigations to which the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  amongst others, previously drew attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems to be, from all reports, something which the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is pursuing consistently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, because I have to allow other members to make a short speech in this debate, I suggest that the problem of the crossroads position of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme as it is seen by some is near enough to being real. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  set the tone of the debate in opening the discussion on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome what the honourable member said concerning the importance of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme which in the post-war period has successfully brought some 2.6 million new settlers to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 can report progress to the House in relation to these studies and I mention that following a recommendation by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council,  Mr J.  R. Wilson, Senior Lecturer in Economics at Sydney <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assignment will be conducted under the general supervision of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council which includes Professor B. R. Williams, Vice Chancellor, Sydney University, whose own authority in the area of cost-benefit analysis is well recognised both in Australia and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, regular exchanges of technical information have taken place with the Canadian Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which has started a similar survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Scullin mentioned the matter of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> museum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the honourable member for Riverina raised the question of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question which concerns the facilitation of travel by Australians to Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However  I  believe these would be relatively few and I know from my colleagues the State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the situation is under continuing review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Possession of Australian citizenship does not, of itself, prevent  a  person from being regarded as an immigrant’ and as such being denied entry to Australia under laws relating to ‘<span class="highlight">immigration</span>’ within the meaning of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701001_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For reasons that were explained by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  and explained in technical detail also in the 48th report of the Commissioner of Taxation, 9 Bills have to be presented on a sales tax measure because of the way in which the tax is imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has not been told to this House by the Treasurer or by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  who is Minister assisting the Treasurer is, which are the sorts of companies that are likely to be advantaged by this new device or by the opening of the gate to the convertible note once more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to an article in the ‘Australian’ on Tuesday, 13 th October, written by  Mr Peter  Ryan, in which he claims that  Mr J.  R. Wilson, who has been appointed by the Minister to head the inquiry into the costs and benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, has prejudged the inquiry already by stating that he is in favour of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, it is a challenge to the professional integrity of  Mr J.  R. Wilson, a senior lecturer at the Sydney University, who has been appointed to undertake the cost benefit analysis which was announced some months ago and, by inference also, it is a challenge to the integrity and the judgment of the distinguished academics, bankers, industrialists and trade union officials who constitute the membership of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council which recommended the study and agreed to  Mr Wilson’s  appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I do not find it strange or unacceptable that the economist to whom reference has been made has a view on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - a matter of professional interest to any economist; nor do I believe that whatever views he does hold - and I must say that I am unaware of them in any detail - in fact will prejudice the objectivity of his research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who is also the Minister assisting the Treasurer to say whether this Bill is the first step in the opening of the flood gates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech on this Bill the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry, the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten)  who is at the table is a member of the Country Party but the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  was previously at the table and I thought he was in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is sitting at the table, may be making, a rough note that the small businesses make up the number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already written lo the honourable Ministers for Civil Aviation and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and as well to the General Manager of Qantas but as yet I have nol received any reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or the Department of Civil Aviation, if need be, should be investigating these agents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time the Department of Civil Aviation and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did something to protect and to assist people in this category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701014_reps_27_hor70/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I desire to address a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Does his Department render financial assistance to the States to provide low cost housing for migrants brought to this country by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman questions the role of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and my own Ministry in relation to the provision of permanent housing in the community is not a matter which falls within my responsibility or indeed the responsibility of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (2) The information on which such records could be maintained is not available to the Department; as the Committee on Social Patterns of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council noted in its report on the departure of settlers from Australia in October 1967, for various reasons some settlers do not declare themselves as such when leaving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The numbers who departed before the expiry of 2 years and who fulfilled the requirements outlined above for the period January 1965 to June 1970, as recorded by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, are shown in the following table: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701016_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-27-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 was concerned about this when I was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701019_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that in an address to the New South Wales Liberals recently be stated that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy as it related to coloured people could not be justified on moral grounds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware also that successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have consistently, and quite rightly in my view, justified and supported the policy on moral, social and economic grounds evidently because of their belief that a government has a moral obligation to protect its own people particularly from racial tensions and friction? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister also state what is immoral about a policy that admits almost 10,000 non-Europeans and people of mixed descent yearly, gives discretionary power to the Minister, has kept Australia’ free from racial hatreds and is based on the same principles as the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of practically every nation in the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may say so, I then concluded those remarks by saying that as far as I was concerned and this Government was concerned we do not propose to alter the liberalised policy we now have in any basic way because I believe it is working and working well and is far more generous than the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of the other countries in the world which most often tend to criticise our policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The same thing can be said in relation to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch),  in the course of his speech, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  stated clearly that this Bill provides for grants to the States in respect of the interest and sinking fund charges on a parcel of State debts amounting to SI, 000m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have availed myself of the opportunities I have had since 1956 of trying also to strengthen greatly the fabric of Australian manufacturing industry because here is a tremendous base of our strength - the base in which most employment is to be found and therefore the base upon which our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy depends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this regard miniature declaratory certificates of citizenship are available from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701030_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-50-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this legislation were outlined fully in a preliminary statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  to the House on 23rd April 1970 and have been further detailed in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Conventions and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council have confirmed that the great barrier to assimilation and integration is the failure of the migrant to speak English and expressed the view that there is a real need for the teaching of the English language at every level for assimilation, social and economic reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not so much a criticism of what has been or is being done for migrants in this regard but rather that a more comprehensive scheme has been delayed so long, particularly in view of the constant urging by conventions and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision of educational services to enable adult migrants to learn the English language began in 1947 in the opening days of post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> schemes or, if I may say so, in the infancy of the programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time, great changes have taken place in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, such as increased numbers, differing types of migrants and methods of transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, with this problem being stressed by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities everywhere, including citizenship conventions, advisory councils and other interested parties, a scheme might well have been expected at a much earlier date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, industry has benefited a lot from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comparatively recently two excellent surveys were conducted, one by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Canberra and the other by the New South Wales Department of Education, on the question of migrant education and the education of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of an Opposition parliamentary committee on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> recently visited a centre where the intensive scheme was in progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an endeavour to offer a constructive approach to improving the education of adult and child migrants and to relieving the States of some of the responsibility for a national programme of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two or 3 weeks ago I attended a meeting of the Australian Institute of Political Science which dealt with the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into migrants the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated - 1 think the word is now integrated - into the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  mentioned in his second reading speech there are 2 or 3 major aspects of this educational programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the major arguments for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> being continuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some problems which seem to be of a minor kind perhaps to which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> might direct his attention if he has not done so already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme was initiated by a Labor government some 25 years ago, and it has been supported by this Government since that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is disappointing for many of us suddenly to get these revelations indicating the stark nature of the situation, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is important to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seventy per cent of the increase in our work force over the last 20 years has come from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department that something like $650 is spent administratively on each migrant, but the net gain is said to be something like $10,000 for each migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all this is the case, although I know there are many who believe it is time we properly evaluated these alleged facts, clearly we should be thinking of migrants from the point of view that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not a one-sided affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The success of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has long been tarnished by an obtuse disinclination to evaluate the problems which migrants and their children encounter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Startling revelations about language problems of migrant children have now come to hand 25 years after the then Labor Government initiated our first <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are lots of people who now say that we should now put a stop to or a brake on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clearly a possibility that we could make a knowledge of English a condition of their <span class="highlight">immigration</span> arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The figures I am quoting come from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  and I think they have a very clear relevance to the Bill since we are talking about educating migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a need for special orientation, lt has been suggested by speakers at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> conventions that morning classes should be initiated to encourage women to participate; that women teachers should be introduced into the system; that there should be husband and wife teaching teams and that migrant couples should be encouraged to participate in these courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When did he learn that at the last meeting  of  the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Ministers the Commonwealth asked the Stales to examine their provisions within Workers’ Compensation Acts, so  far  as such Acts affected migrants, with  a  view to reaching uniformity of conditions  (Hansard,  1st September 1970, page 821). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-31-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister indicate clearly to the House that, contrary to the opinions of some international moralists, Australia’s non-European <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is our own business and is designed to preserve a community free from the tensions which characterise other parts of the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overriding objective of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is to ensure the continuing development of a cohesive and homogeneous community, well integrated and harmonious, without persisting divisions or disunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> familiar with the claim of some economists that it requires up to 2i persons to service the demands and needs of a migrant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> programmes must, of course, always be responsive to changing circumstances, and against the circumstances recently outlined to this House by the Prime Minister the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has in fact been modified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment moved by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  makes one inclined to ask what is the use of the operation at all? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 12 months ago the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden),  who was acting for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, tabled in this House a piece of legislation to cover migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This evening the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has told us that there was no need for the legislation because he had proceeded with the granting of money and so on without legislative authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  at the second reading stage, in response to a query I put to him, indicated that the assistance which will be extended under this Bill will also be extended to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this in fact is what happens I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  ought to take steps to see that there is no disadvantage placed upon the State system because some of that State’s bureaucracies are slow moving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from the appropriation by Parliament, as I indicated in brief this afternoon legislation is not strictly necessary for the purposes of this Bill as no coercive powers are being sought and the activities of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in arranging for the expenditure of moneys in fact would be well within the executive powers of the Commonwealth with respect to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The special provisions in this Bill - I again emphasise the payment of salaries of these special teachers in addition to teaching aids and so on, is a very progressive step forward by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and will be a big factor in enabling migrant children to settle more quickly into their new environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 carried out a survey of a number of government and independent schools in my electorate and all welcomed these new proposals in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Bill 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly I shall make some general points on the subject and, secondly, 1 shall deal with some of the questions that I would ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  arising out of the Bill and the comments he made during his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> too often is viewed on a statistical basis rather than on a human and sociological basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The short title - <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act 1970 - indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> provision in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that the Minister raised this question because 1 think it shows quite clearly that this Government should also introduce similar types of legislation dealing with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> (hospitals), <span class="highlight">immigration</span> (mental hospitals), <span class="highlight">immigration</span> (councils) and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> (all kinds of issues). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently he believes - and 1 hope he is right - that under the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> provisions of the Constitution money could be fed to areas such as the States and local government where extra money is needed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we have increased our population bv <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by a huge number of people has put terrific pressure on other areas of government and not just on education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recently attended a summer school organised by the Institute of Political Science al which a number of people were critical of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I would like to make is that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> after 21 3’ears of extensive operation is coming into disrepute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely if the Minister really believes that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme ought to be continued, from the point of view of public relations, if from no other aspect, it should be possible to show that a certain amount of money is being given to the States and local government on the basis that it is money to reimburse them for extra costs due to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will strive to discourage State education departments from screening children with a migrant background too soon after their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that he is sympathetic to the general <span class="highlight">immigration</span> proposition and the problems surrounding it.I think that a danger exists these days because many people who support the views expressed by the Government and Opposition Parties in this House are starting to talk about the quality of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disappointed that at the conference to which I referred earlier there were people who talked about racial equality, who opposed our so-called white Australia policy and who encouraged <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on a non racial basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These people are making value judgments in the same way as those who oppose the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of Chinese are making value judgments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, I believe that to some extent we must look at it from the point of view of the migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 hope that the Minister, when he is dealing with people who criticise our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy by using statistics as many people do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is one of the few subjects on which Government and Opposition members agree pretty much on all aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, in the cost/ benefit analysis which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  has arranged - for which I congratulate him - these questions which I would like to have dealt with will be answered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going back over the history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe the motives for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have changed since those years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems is that we cannot control the flow of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by, as it were, turning the tap on and turning the tap off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also concerned about the problems which are arising within the’ Yugoslav community in Australia because, as I recollect, when this legislation was foreshadowed and the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> agreement with Yugoslavia was entered into a year or so ago the arrangement was that we were to receive a very large number of skilled tradesmen migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there are some things in the Bill and some attitudes about our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that can be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the problem of increasing the skilled work force ‘will not be solved by- raising the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target in order to acquire more craftsmen from overseas, although anything that can be done to increase the proportion of skilled persons among immigrants will be useful’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  have helped in settling some Asian migrants and generally the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been helpful, effective and speei.lv. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s views on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and matters of this nature are very well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Australian Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that when the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is mentioned not only the honourable member for Boothby but also a number of other honourable members on the other side of the House seem to be very condescending in their attitude towards the whole question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those honourable members seem to forget that Australian history is one of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and that the honourable member for Boothby is a descendant of immigrants, as 1 am and as is every other member who sits in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  is well aware of the matter about which I speak because I wrote to him about it in the middle of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the recess last year the Government members <span class="highlight">immigration</span> committee flew to Perth and joined the migrant vessel ‘Australis’ on its trip to Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was sorry to hear the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  announce at question time today that our migrant intake this year will be cut back to about 170,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aims to save S2.6m in salaries, administration expenses, capital works and services, and migrant embarkation costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  would know from the statistics available the age groups that have arrived in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has had very good intentions, because of the interpretation placed on it people in other countries say that we are ‘anti them’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this had been done in the past our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme would have been much more successful and many more migrants would have stayed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that a recent survey conducted by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> indicates that about one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English, and the Department’s classes cater for only a small proportion of these. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  does not agree with me on this matter, for obviously if he did the Bill would be substantially different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Federal Department of Education and Science, which is administering Commonwealth grants for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, is insisting that teaching follow the situational method which is taught to adult migrants in its classes for children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> can explain this in the committee stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  said that he was disappointed with an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> agreement that we had wilh Yugoslavia because of the small number of skilled people who were coming to Australia from that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We face the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  across the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>believe that the general approach we have made to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been fairly effective but that our most miserable failure has been in the way we have approached particularly :he children who have arrived here as a result of the migration scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no denying that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is an absolute Commonwealth responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am putting this on the record and  1  hope that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Treasury officials and all the other people concerned take notice of it.I know it is probably not the Minister’s fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker, earlierI was discussing the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Bill and the Opposition’s proposal that the Government should have made provision for capital works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ have always found it a source of amusement when I have had to sign an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> form for entry to the United States of America, for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I have explained to the poor <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer who had put the question that I was not really a citizen of the Soviet Union he has said, ‘No, it does not mean that’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T have always explained to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in great detail - I am happy to be patient with them - that if I am an Aboriginal I can be quite black and I am also a Caucasian anthropologically speaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this has happened the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer has looked at me with some horror and has said that apparently Congress had not heard about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be more specific in relation to the measure before us, this Bill comes down against a background of widespread questioning of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been demonstrated by the findings and investigations of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  before I rose in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why 1 addressed an appeal while I was overseas recently to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to reject completely and very bluntly the statements made by the Victorian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Minister, Mr Vance Dickie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He caused resentment amongst the most conservative Australians who said that this man did not speak for our people, did not speak even for the Government and, I am sure, did not speak for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who sits at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment ignores the substantial measures taken since the early days of post war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by this Government and by the government before it to develop a comprehensive programme of migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in 1947 when at the initiative of the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the now Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, agreement was reached between the Commonwealth Government and the Preparatory Commission of the International Refugee Organisation on a scheme for the admission of refugees and displaced persons from Europe that the first action was taken to formulate a migration education programme which involved at that time both the teaching of English and an appreciation of Australian life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February 1960 a special committee of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council submitted a report on the progress and assimilation of migrant children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> again took the initiative in 1962 in conducting a survey of ‘Abandonment from Migrant Education Classes in Victoria’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let me emphasise the point that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not totally a Commonwealth responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, in the particular context of the economic circumstances with which this nation is now dealing, these conditions provide further restraints on Government spending and support the view that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> funds should not be used to finance capital works in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This major study, along with the cost benefit analysis, will provide in the future that information which we, as a Commonwealth Government, need to structure better future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes to our objectives in the 1970s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost benefit study of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a long overdue attempt to provide an evaluation of the costs and benefits to Australia of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only exception is in the case of the migrant from Lebanon who is able to satisfy the Australian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> authorities on investigation in Beirut that he is a non-rural citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-43-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crushing debt burdens imposed on these authorities by years of Commonwealth engendered <span class="highlight">immigration</span> pressures and Commonwealth financial neglect must be met from a narrow tax base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  announced outside the Parliament his private, leisurely inquiry into some aspects, and no report is yet in sight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed one or two things that I thought might have been mentioned perhaps in the first place by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  when speaking on legislation concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the last 2 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, for many years, dating back to the start of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> with Arthur Calwell, the Labor Party al least has had a very consistent, easily understood and quite plain <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we have a new Labor doctrine on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it goes beyond the Leader’s sort of private remarks made in the atmosphere of the moment, but the new Whitlam policy in regard to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is to bring to Australia the relatives of those who are here, but not to bring new members of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever this controversy may settle - and a lot of people have different views - it is quite plain that the advantage that we get immediately out of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is the acquisition to the work force of skilled workers who are immediately productive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know whether this new scheme will emerge as the new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be interesting to know because the Opposition spokesmen on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, as well as other people, over the years have pointed out that the one thing that cannot be done with an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is to turn it on and off suddenly for temporary reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First of all he wants to whittle away almost completely our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would like to get its hands if it had the opportunity on that section of government expenditure that flows in the direction, of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and put it into other fields of expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The approach of the Government, however, to reduce the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake by about 10,000 people is a reasonable approach and is, I believe, the kind of action that any responsible government would want to take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has shown the need, in the context of inflation, for fuller study of our tariff system, our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, our powers in respect of restrictive trade practices and of our taxation structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the Minister’s statement which indicated a reduction of about 10,000 in this year’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the estimated saving in the cost of the  <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme this financial year as a result in the reduction of numbers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the reduction this year is it to be taken that the Government proposes drastically to curtail the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for the year 1971-72? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against the economic circumstances recently outlined in this House by the Prime Minister, the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for 1970-71 has been modified to include the arrival of 120,500 assisted migrants and 49,500 unassisted migrants - a total this year of about 170,000 migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710309_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The distinguished member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  is uncertain as to whether or not he is any longer able to represent the concensus in the Australian Labor Party on its attitude to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy there is a definite conflict within the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  has in the past supported a bi-partisan <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware that a percentage of Australian university graduates from Asian countries, after being refused residential status in Australia, migrate to developed countries such as Canada? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After ali, it has long been the policy of this Government that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requirements of any country are matters solely for the judgment of the country concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on a large scale seems to bring about a more unsettled state of affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How they got through the screening of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials in other lands is beyond me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials must be incompetent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because in the last 20-odd years we have been supplementing our natural population increase by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> the expansion of the cities has been accelerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Government will have to look seriously at whether our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> quota is too large to allow our urban development programmes to adapt to the rapid population increase, although, as the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  has mentioned, the incidence of crime amongst migrants is much lower than in the Australian born population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710317_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will also answer questions on matters for which the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council is responsible The other representational arrangements in that chamber will be:  Senator Wright,  the portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Education and Science, Labour and National Service, Housing and External Territories;  Senator Cotton,  the portfolios of Trade and Industry, National Development, Shipping and Transport, Customs and Excise, and Interior;  ‘Senator DrakeBrockman,  the portfolios of Primary Industry, Army, Repatriation and Navy;  Senator Greenwood,  the portfolios of Attorney-General, Postmaster-General, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and Social Services, including Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710330_reps_27_hor71/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Did the Australian Government or the Australian High Commissioner in Great Britain suggest to the British Government, as has been widely alleged, that the provisions of its <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Bill should not apply to patrials - in effect, to persons who had at least one grandparent born in Britain? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our High Commissioner did make representations to the British Government relating to the then provisions of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Bill as they related to patrials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In case there is any quibbling on the part of any Government supporters as to the accuracy of what I say about the deficiency of the system of social service benefits in this country I will quote from a report of the Committee on Social Patterns of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council entitled ‘The Departure of Settlers from Australia’. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710331_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also true, as was fairly clearly pointed out in the Vernon Report, that one of the restricting factors on increased national productivity is a high level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask Government spokesmen whether they are prepared to reduce the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into this country merely to provide the country with a greater percentage figure of increased productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further proof can be obtained from the report of Australia’s <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council which is investigating <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes for the period 1968-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware of a public statement made in Perth yesterday by a visiting Japanese Government economic mission that future joint ventures between Australia and Japanese interests in Australia could be impeded unless our current migration policies insofar as they affect Japanese migrants, are altered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710402_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that certain skilled Japanese workers may enter Australia under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws as they are applied at present, and that the real restrictions to which the Japanese dignitaries refer are industrial limitations imposed by certain sectors of the trade union movement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710402_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The growth in domestic demand and employment has been strong, stable and sustained, and it has been due essentially to the Government’s unwavering commitment to full employment, its pursuit of wide-ranging manpower policies, including <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and an effective national employment service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710406_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> pointed out to me in a reply to a question that occasionally European parents working in Asian and Pacific countries wished to send their children to school in Australia while they are still too young for entry as migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we applied this line of thinking to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, it would mean that anyone who got off an aeroplane from England, Italy, Spain, Germany, Holland or wherever he may come from would be asked, when he reached the bottom of the gangplank: Does your country need you?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for National Development  (Mr Swartz),  who is at the table, to convey these sentiments to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and to ask that in future he not differentiate between Asians and Europeans in this vital sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that members of the Japanese Government economic mission in Perth recently indicated that the future of Japanese investment in Australia’s development of raw materials and industry may depend to a great extent on Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it clear, because of inaccurate Press reports, that there has been no questioning by the Japanese Government to the Australian Government of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the question that was asked by the honourable gentleman I point out that the Australian Government has not thought it necessary to raise the question of Japanese <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies with the Japanese Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the last part of the honourable gentleman’s question, I think all I can say is that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy does not, of course, differentiate between the nationals of countries according to the amount of trade that those countries do with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This decision was a ministerial one - I know this because I have checked it - and the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is now the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  indicated that he made it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>on earth; that we have eagerly supported the most unpopular war in modern times, on the ground that Asia should be a battle-ground of our freedom; that we fail to oppose the sale of arms to South Africa; that the whole world believes that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is based on colour and that we run one of the world’s last colonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that Australia’s national reputation has been damaged because many of its policies are interpreted as racist - I refer to those on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, Aboriginals and New Guinea, just to name a few - but primarily we believe that it is wrong to play sport against a team which deliberately excludes players of a different colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, I agree to some extent with that point of view but surely a matter connected with a change in Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is something for which the Minister is responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Speaker, I have moved this motion arising out of the refusal by a certain honourable member in this House to allow me to make a statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I can hardly remain silent today when again I am publicly misrepresented in respect of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been represented in the eyes of the Australian people as having misinterpreted or not knowing our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> now which are of very great concern to people who have migrated here and who want to bring friends and relatives here; there are many aspects which are of vary great concern to those areas of Australia where municipal and other institutions have exceptional burdens because of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the following words be added to the motion: and also to permit the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to make a statement on the Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Minister for Health, now the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  - perhaps a less controversial, or at least for him less controversial, portfolio - seemed to make a Freudian slip in the course of his discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  that when matters of public importance are brought forward from time to time - and this has been quite frequently in recent weeks - it is noticeable that they relate to issues which are being debated by the Government or the responsible authorities and others involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710423_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Prime Minister answer this parochial question from an undistinguished back bencher with 50 years honorary service in the Australian Labor Party: Is it the intention of the Government to relax the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws of this country to allow Japanese workers to be employed in the motor car industry in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy, that is, the policy of the Liberal and Country Parties, on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has not been changed in substance since March 1966 when the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> announced what our policy was - not static, because we are constantly looking at the problem of migration to see whether there should be any liberalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are going to put <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in reverse and send people to live somewhere else because we cannot get them jobs here in factories, which are the only places in which they can get jobs, we are going to be in a pretty sorry state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nobody on the Government side has explained to us yet how the Government intends to maintain our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake if it abolishes the tariff system, which some honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710428_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the’ Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Are all “ migrants who are British subjects given the same opportunity to apply foi and be granted Australian citizenship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I accept the Minister’s statement that the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  is much affected by these inquiries I feel also that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  must have a continuing interest because of certain criteria his Department applies for admission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> power was given to the Commonwealth at Federation for very good reasons, and the same considerations to which I am referring - the lack of contact at the local level, and the creation of a hospital system which is malleable and adjustable to individual circumstances and the felt needs of particular communities of people and particular areas - was one of the principal reasons why the hospital power was left with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am going to say quite bluntly that 1 think the Ministerial Member of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> if he is to become that, in Papua New Guinea should have the power of deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The power over <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and emigration - who comes into their country and who goes out of it - would be a very important step in self-government and 1 believe that it would lead to certain changes in attitudes that might improve race relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710504_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the reduced <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for this year will provide an opportunity, as I said in my statement on the size of the programme, to extend and develop our welfare and education activities amongst migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By way of explanation I refer to the Minister’s statement advising  that the Government has decided to reduce the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme by 30,000 next year, reducing the target to 140,000 settlers, including 100,000 assisted migrants and at least 40,000 unassisted migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To set against the many benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> there are costs in education, housing and transport which are real factors for State governments even though the cost of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> itself is a minor element in total Commonwealth expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Italian Under-Secretary for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Bemporad,  during a recent visit to Australia said that many provisions of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Agreement between Australia and Italy were inadequate and provided little security for Italian migrants and requested that it should be brought up to date? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Mr Bemporad  state that the Italian Government was dissatisfied with the methods of the Australian Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and had sought assurances that information on living and working conditions be accurate and reflect more closely the local situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question has been construed as referring to expenditure incurred for all <span class="highlight">immigration</span> purposes as distinct from the costs involved directly in recruitment of migrants and passage assistance only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-37-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I express my complete support for a proposition stated by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Sir Hubert  Opperman, on 23rd September 1965, who, when refusing visas to the East German pentathlon team said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This work, which is being financed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, is being carried out at the Australian National University under the supervision of Professor W.

  <li>
    <p>For many years the Leader of the Opposition made a passing reference to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been a great engine of growth within this country for many years and it has provided adequate increases, helpful increases to the work force each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the social philosophy of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been one which has influenced Australia socially as well as economically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">immigration</span> Minister, from the first Minister forward to the present Minister, has indicated that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in Australia provides a welcome addition to the natural increase in the Australian work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to family code policies enunciated at Launceston, according to which the natural addition to the Australian work force following some second-rate left wing overseas intellectual proposition is to be reduced, he desires to increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from non-European sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proposes that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> no longer be an addition to the Australian growth programme; it is in fact to be a substitute for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a change of a philosophy which is supported by the present shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and was supported by the first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This will barely offset the rises in costs due to inflation and will not take into account the increase in the population of children in schools, an increase due to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, our own birth rate and also the longer time children are now expected to stay at school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own personal view is that Australia should drastically cut her <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should question whether it is in the interest of Australia to continue our assisted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme in view of the pressure of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the States, on education, on health and our hospitals, on local government, on spiralling land and housing costs; in fact on all aspects of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to ponder not only our population increase but also our increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned overseas capital, questions relating to national development, education, the crisis in the primary industries, the need for a real policy of decentralisation of population, the need to deal with urban problems, the need to deal with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the need to achieve a national identity which involves the quality of life and films which we make ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I appreciate the presence in the House of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  representing the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  to whom I indicated that I would be talking on this topic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710908_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Commonwealth, which continues to place pressures on the States, one of the reasons for the refusal of the States to accept the proposed new agreement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This great programme was initiated by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  in bis capacity as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the post-war Chifley Government and has been carried on successfully by various governments since 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret very much that, as the very basis for the determination of a social welfare policy, the Opposition has adopted policies with respect to Australian family codes and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, which is itself an addition to the work force, which run counter to every tradition that we have had in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are confronted with these problems in Australia - particularly, of course in Sydney and Melbourne - and they are rapidly being compounded as more and more people, whether from natural increase, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or drift from the country areas, come to where job opportunities exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether his attention has been drawn to the case of an American,  Mr James  O’Leary, his wife and 13 children, who entered Australia on a 2-day visitors’ visa and who are now living on their broken-down boat which is moored in a Queensland swamp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> read a report in today’s Press of the refusal by his Department to grant citizenship to Greek born Nick Karajas of Victoria? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since the postwar <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme was launched by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  to whom I pay tribute, it has been accepted as axiomatic by both sides in this Parliament that the national interest requires the effective control of the size and structure of the migrant inflow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say has been accepted’ because the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in his speech on the Budget with his penchant for trimming his policies to the prevailing fashions of the patio intellectuals, has become an advocate not of control but of laissez-faire in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, because this is what natural migration, open migration or sponsored migration is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition who would introduce controls and planning into virtually every aspect of our economic and social life, has become an advocate of laissez-faire in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No responsible Australian Government could abrogate its responsibilities by allowing the size and structure of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme to be determined by the unco-ordinated decisions of thousands of individuals here and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the intemperate nature of some recent attacks on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and even particular migrant groups, can be described adequately only in terms of the legal definition of fraudulent misrepresentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To advocate, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, a totally passive role for the Commonwealth Government in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is completely unrealis tic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parenthetically, I make the point that to confine our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme to sponsored cases would effectively preclude Australia from accepting refugees who, with few exceptions, are wholly Government sponsored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Critics of the Government’s policies also forget that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not an end in itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as in the past, the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme - and particularly assisted migration - will continue to be directed towards our major national objectives through its influence on the size and structure of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is only one part of an overall population situation, only one of several components of population change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the social, economic and demographic effects of the components of population change - births, deaths, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and emigration - vary quite substantially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changes in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme cannot entirely offset the consequences of changes in other population, and work force, factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither is natural increase and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> the mutually conflicting possibilities which they are sometimes represented to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, an increased birth rate as an alternative to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, as sometimes advocated, is neither feasible nor relevant to Australia’s needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But natural increase and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> are not mutually conflicting alternatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we are traditionally a country of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most that we can reasonably ask of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is that it improve the situation which otherwise would exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is foolish, and indeed dangerous, to regard <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as some kind of economic and social ‘wonder drug’ which will overcome all our problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is, of course, just as foolish - and just as dangerous - to regard <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as the sole or principal cause of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the essential purpose of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is, as I said before, to contribute towards our major national objectives through its influence on the size and structure of our population and work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is against this background that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes are being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This information will be used by the Government, together with other considerations, in determining the size and structure of future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another major study is being carried out at the university of Sydney under the aegis of the Commonweath <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This study is concerned with establishing the costs and benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under existing Australian conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Like the cost benefit analysis, this survey is being carried out in association with the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion I would remind the House, that as previously announced and for reasons then given, the Government has decided on an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme of 140,000 for 1971-72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even in the short term however, a smaller <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is not going to be some kind of universal panacea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most certainly, also, the decision to set a smaller <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme this year was not, and is not, intended by the Government as a convenient substitute for action by others in their particular fields of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In determining the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for 1971-72, the Government has acted with the courage of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I would like to correct the misinterpretation and distortion of the policy of the Australian Labor Party on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as given by the Minister for <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  a few minutes ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all aware of the position in Britain and America and this is the reason that previous Australian governments, including Labor governments, have maintained a restricted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the present Hawke-Whitlam axis has changed Labor’s policy in this regard and Australians may well have similar problems if a Labor government with an open door <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy ever comes to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we claim the right to dictate how the South Africans should handle their internal problems, cannot other countries by the same premise place boycotts and sanctions on Australia because they might claim that they do not like the way we treat our Aboriginals or that they do not like our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is about high time that the Government - and I hope this is understood - put the axe into the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last thing I want to say is that under the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme we have placed a tremendous burden on the States and on local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Speaker,  I wish to make a personal explanation because the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and, later, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  who represents the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson),  misrepresented me during question time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Today it is fashionable to knock <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and the critics of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy point to the demands which the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme makes on the economy and the additional amount of money which has to be spent on roads, schools, hospitals and sewerage systems because of the number of migrants which we as a government have brought to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The critics of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy base most of their criticism on the demand for capital which they claim is aggravated by our intake of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Industrial action - we are told that industrial disputes cost us  2i  million man days a year when there are  5i  million man days worked each day - more and better <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the size of the armed forces always appear as numbers and statistics, but never are any background information and reasonably accurate reports by qualified inquirers given as to what the expected requirements are or will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Tasmanian Minister for Tourism and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has advised me that he is replying to representations concerning Lake Pedder as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say on this general question of the departure of migrants from Australia that the figures for 1970-71 recently published by the Commonwealth Statistician which show that about 28,000 migrants left Australia or stated that they were leaving Australia permanently, have to be seen against the very high level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that we have had in the last 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government is not complacent about this question and I have asked the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, which undertook a previous study of settlers departing from Australia to undertake a further study to ascertain whether there is anything that we can do to reduce the rate of outflow of permanent settlers from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Figures given in 1969 and 1970 by the former Minister for Health - the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  - who introduced this scheme indicated that there were approximately 184,000 specifically low income families living on the minimum wage or $6 above it - these figures are in black and white - who would have been entitled to full or partial subsidy for the cost of health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711005_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I might say in reply to the honourable gentleman that it is the policy of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in cases involving the introduction of specialist labour for short-term periods to check carefully with my own Department, the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise as only one example the decisions that are made by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to indicate how this gells or does not co-ordinate with the decisions that are made in Treasury from time to time about the rate of growth of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was virtually telling the honourable member for Angas and his colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  who is overseas at the present time, to get off their backsides and do something for the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strange to relate, as the honourable member for McMillan pointed out quite rightly - I have mentioned this matter before time after time in this Committee - the past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has depended and the future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme still is depending on secondary industries to provide employment for new settlers coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we have a relatively fully employed economy we still do not have enough workers, so much so that we are running an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme to get more workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I feel some revulsion when I read in the Press statements by various spokesmen for industry who support the continuation of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme - and this may well be justified - but, this is something that will be established by a current inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As an instance, on television last night, in respect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, another great issue of the Australian Labor Party- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I am against the suspension of Standing Orders because I consider that it is nothing but an endeavour to float this particular policy but not other policies, such as the policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, which could perhaps be more embarrassing to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  who usually represents the Minister for Health in this place, was, to my mind, obviously wrong in his estimates of the effect of the proposed increases in patient contributions on the total amount involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711013_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 14th July 1945 the Honourable Arthur Calwell was appointed Australia’s first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, heralding one of the most immense mass movements of population of our time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive governments and Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> supported by dedicated, understanding, tolerant department officials at home and abroad, with the co-operation of churches, trade unions, employers and voluntary organisations have contributed unselfishly to its success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ALP supports an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last year the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> announced the appointment of 3 committees to inquire into the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  suggest to the Minister that in the interests of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and its future this inquiry should have been conducted by an all party parliamentary committee from both Houses of the National Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any programme deserves a committee of this type it is the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme because the scheme itself owes its success to the sympathetic support of members from all parties in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real question to be investigated is why the Commonwealth in continuing the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has thrust its responsibilities in housing, education and health services on to the States and has not provided adequate financial resources resulting in shortages and deficit budgets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The ramifications of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme are enormous, and were exemplified in the Minister’s speech recently when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were first enunciated by the present right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  by successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and by every Government since 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and his influential, intellectual friends, among them the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  have proposed a complete - even if disguised - overturning of the principles of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly clear, and undeniable, that these men played a leading role in the formulation of the policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, a policy on which they want an inquiry and a policy that was adopted by the Launceston Conference only weeks ago by 44 votes to one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me state the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> philosophy which has been rejected, and I quote from Hansard of 2nd August 1945 what the present right honourable member for Melbourne, the first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is, at best, only the counterpart of the most important phase of population building, natural increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition and his new shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> now propose its submergence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These completely new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> principles are merely another way of saying in migration first come, first served. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that the Leader of the Opposition either deliberately misrepresented the position because he was in a hot seat or he has a deplorable knowledge of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> trends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every country surely has the right to a substantial control of its own <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>uncontrolled and risky <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were the very characteristics of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia in the late nineteenth century - in Queensland we know it - and to Britain in the 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every Australian Minister and shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has, until now, pressed the desire for a socially cohesive, homogeneous community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler,  (Mr Daly),  who a short time ago was ‘axed’ as the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and more especially the right honourable member for Melbourne, who was Australia’s father of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, have always followed and believed in those principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy followed by successive governments - both Labor and Liberal-Country Party- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy followed by successive governments - both Labor governments and Liberal-Country Party governments - and a policy which has served this country well, would be totally repudiated, and that is the intention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that on this side of the chamber there is some desire to curtail the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme which was launched so magnificently a generation ago by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme has added  2i  million people to our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that there are great divisions within the Opposition over its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only recently the honourable member for Grayndler was sacked by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  from the position- of shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but tonight he carried the torch for his leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the very short time at my disposal I want to speak in support of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said during the debate on the Budget it has become fashionable, for some reason, to knock <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am yet to be convinced that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> contributes either to unemployment or to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sought 3 tables of statistics relating to 6 selected countries and to the subjects of the annual rate of increase of the consumer price index, the percentage of the work force unemployed and the net long term <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a percentage of mid-year population for each *&gt;f those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could have selected any other 5 countries to make a comparison with Australia but I chose Canada and New Zealand as countries of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, Japan and the United Kingdom as countries of intense manufacturing industry and as countries which have not increased their population through migration, and I chose the United States of America both as  a  highly intensive manufacturing country and as a country which still attracts migrants in reasonable numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely those statistics indicate that we should be looking elsewhere than to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to find the reasons for the present rate of inflation and increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been made the scapegoat for changing economic conditions which have affected countries other than Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, statistics show that Australia, which has the highest percentage of migration intake, has managed to combat the problems of inflation and unemployment far better than countries which have either no <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake or a lesser one than Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in my opinion <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not to blame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition when he addressed the Perth Press Club only last Sunday on the subject of Labor’s approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring to the impact which migrants who have come to Australia under the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy have, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before dealing with the amendment that is before the chamber, which asks the Government to set up a joint select committee to inquire into <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, I would like to congratulate the chamber - by that I mean honourable members on both sides of the chamber - on being embarrassed by the speech of the Minister for Housing  (Mr Kevin Cairns). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then over the last 1 or 2 years an attack developed on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, combining often contradictory economic growth arguments and so-called quality of life arguments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have others arguing that in fact <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is increasing our gross national product at too great a rate and that all that matters is the so-called quality of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This argument ignores the fact that most of the problems mentioned are problems in all industrial societies, even those with no <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the attacks on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> increase both sides of the House might decide that it would be politically dangerous to defend <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, no matter what the facts proved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This tendency to bi-partisanship, or what I would call me-too-ism, has been attached to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for a long time, but it is not peculiar to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as far as political issues in this country are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main reasons why the antiimmigration feeling has built up is that it represents a subconscious return to the old Australian dreams of isolation and also a nostalgia for the more simple days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been helped by the fact that Government leaders until recently have been urging another dream, that of getting bigger and bigger, and secondly that the Government has no information on a cost-benefit basis on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recently as  1969  the then Treasurer, who is now Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  was asked a question on the costs of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Irwin). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was sorry for the Minister when, as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, he had to defend the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme at a summer school of the Australian Institute of Political Science earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people there were antagonistic towards him and the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and he was unable to produce appropriate figures to defend it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the fault of the Government which has been in office for  22  years and has not properly analysed its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before concluding I wish to refer to a matter which specifically affects migrants although it is not strictly within the administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I realise that I am not dealing with a function of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but surely it is concerned about the way migrants look at Australia and their expectations, whether they feel that Australia is giving them a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To summarise, let us not accept as factual the belief of those people who blame a whole host of modern problems on migrants, thereby providing a unique Australian analysis of problems that in fact characterise most advanced industrialised societies, most- of which do not have <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes, anyway, as the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  pointed out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we should look very carefully at our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has a very sound <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy had one great architect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been his general attitude, and perhaps that is the reason why he dumped the peasant from Grayndler as Labor’s spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly has been a restrictive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, but not nearly as restrictive as the policies of many Asian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With its vaunted high standard of living, culture and all the rest, the problems which it faces are a striking example of how difficult this <span class="highlight">immigration</span> question is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have Britain’s example of what happened when she allowed unrestricted <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually she had to restrict <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have many policies on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again, in an attempt to gain political popularity he has fallen down on his face again because the Australian people do not want his <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy or the policy of so many others who have expressed variations of Labor’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, I do not believe that the Australian Labor Party has an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy today, because it has left the policy of the right honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Grayndler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is an important problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We Australians have established an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy to give us a homogeneous society, and we are determined to maintain it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In joining the Opposition’s case for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, I want to remind honourable members this evening that in general Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has operated in a satisfactory manner in the past not because of any great credit that this Government could claim but rather despite the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable members that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme was planned by the Australian Labor Party over 25 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its initial success was due to the brilliant and sympathetic administration of the scheme in its early years by Australia’s first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its continued success over the years has been due to the fact that successive Liberal Party Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who have administered the programme have carried on the policy which was basically formulated and instituted by Labor’s first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Liberal Party has never had a basic <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of its own, and it is not unusual, of course, that so many policies that we are able to illustrate effectively in this Parliament have come to fruition by accident rather than by plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote not only my own words this evening when I say that this Government has no <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The starting point ot an; economic analysis should be the recognition that the Australian Commonwealth Government does not have, and has not had, a coherent policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme’ consists essentially of an  i  in migration target,  announced  annually by the Commonwealth Government, and assorted schemes for assisting migrants by paying all or part of’ their fares to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government, which is bankrupt of ideas for the operation of a suitable pro gramme for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the 1970s and afterwards, is hypocritical enough to endeavour to belittle the policy of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say proudly that the Labor Party has, and it always has had, a detailed and concise policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members, and not only members from this side of the chamber, have referred to it, but not one speaker has been able to refer to any basic policy which the Liberal Party has on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party makes no secret of its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, or any of its other policies for that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is published in a book of policy, and the policy of our 29th Commonwealth Conference is available for all to read. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment this evening just as I  supported  the honourable member  for Grayndler  12 months ago when he suggested, during a similar debate in this chamber,  that a  select committee should  be appointed to inquire  into <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say, as the  Labor Party did  25 years ago, that the  Parliament should adopt  an honest, sensible  and Australian  approach to this nation’s future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, 12 months ago during a similar debate I supported a proposal similar to the amendment which has been moved this evening and on that occasion I appealed to the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - of course, there is a different Minister now administering the Government’s policy; the present Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  who is now sitting at the table, was the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> then- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time I appealed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to consider the plan to have a tame, departmentally appointed committee investigate Australia’s future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a time lag makes a joke of any benefit that could come from this committee’s investigations because in the meantime - at least, during the last months of this Government - Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy will continue to drift along, changed to suit the whims of him who happens to administer the policy at any particular time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most suitable group to study Australia’s future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs is one selected from among members of this Parliament, for it is in this Parliament that decisions on our future programme must be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In quoting this example I will show how ineffective it is for any Government appointed committee of inquiry to determine any need for change in our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and how difficult it is to have the Government accept any recommendation for change that it might submit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a committee of inquiry which was set up by the Government’s <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee should support the amendment, moved in relation to the estimates of this Department, seeking the establishment of a joint select committee to inquire into Australia’s future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equally clearly, this is not sufficient and Australia must proceed with our controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and bring into Australia the most suitable people available, having regard to the economic circumstances from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is a matter of great regret that the long standing bipartisan policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was abandoned by the Australian Labor Party at its Launceston Conference this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy instituted many years ago by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  and supported until recently by the great majority of the people on the other side of the chamber appears to have been discarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a vital part of the success of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme that migrants be regarded and treated in all respects as human beings, not merely as statistics in terms of population growth or increased work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay a very sincere tribute to the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  and to  Sir Tasman  Heyes for the magnificent work they did in the early post-war years in launching what has been the largest and most successful <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme of any country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the years I served as  Chairman  of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council I was very closely associated with both the Minister and departmental officers in Australia and overseas, and I have first hand knowledge of their dedication and efficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major proposed increases of expenditure on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in this Bill relate to migrant education services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all I would like to make some brief reference to honourable members on the Government side who have spoken this evening on this matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man whom he repudiated as the Opposition’s shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  has come into this Committee with the support of quite a number of his colleagues, led for the Opposition in this debate and moved the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be little doubt that Australia’s post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, and its implementation, has been remarkably successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, our whole way of life, our culture, and our economy have been enriched by the application of a selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which has allowed and supported this massive inflow of people from all over the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something which needs to be emphasised and repeated again and again, until people from all oyer the world will realise that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is not a racist one bat, like those of most other countries, is a selective one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 aspects of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy upon which I would like to comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know and appreciate the work being done by the research groups set up by the Government, which will appreciably assist the assessment of desirable levels of migrant intake, and a host of other factors concerned with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is on the second aspect of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which I mentioned that I would like to spend some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, with its massive effects on the structure of our society, is a subject of the utmost concern to every person in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we all know, the Labor Party at its recent conference at Launceston came up with a different form of words for its Party platform in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  who, as we all know was described by his own leader as knowing more about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> than anyone else in the Labor Party - and hence is of insufficient capacity to be retained as shadow minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - said on 22nd July this year: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From what I have read in the Press, the changed  vording  of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy does not  represent  any significant change from my interpretation  of  the policy before the conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, family reunion has always been given the highest priority in Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>very interested to know that the Party traditionally seen as representing their interests in fact had an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which could be interpreted as advocating, introduction of cheap labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of South Australia has been most outspoken on the issue of non-European migration and has been quoted as saying that he advocated a system of Asian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia similar to that operating in Canada, and also of putting the proposition that a homogenous Australia was nonsense and that he would like to see the country as a radical melting pot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has this attitude to assisted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ever been repudiated by any member of the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as on so many other policy issues, the Labor Party speaks with many tongues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That absorption has been carried out under an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme the foundation principles of which have never been seriously challenged or criticised either inside or outside Australia during that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there have been some minor alterations to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act over the years they have not made and I do not believe they were intended to make any significant difference to the initial intention of the programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, one could never expect to witness within the entire community anything like unanimous approval for everything that is done or not done in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that, because those same people, both young and old, are spread over the whole of Australia, which in turn means that the whole Australian community, those whose parents were born here and those whose parents were not born here, and who also have different interests, outlooks and attitudes and, in some cases perhaps, memories or knowledge of events in the early part of this century which were not entirely palatable, is vitally interested in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people are all involved in some way or another, and it is only natural that the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> always has been, and for some time at least will continue to be, a very sensitive area of deliberation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This being so, the fact that the plan has operated so smoothly over so many years and has not required other than minor alterations is, I believe, a very great tribute to the first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who commenced its opera tions in the difficult early, post-war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>opinion that any well-founded criticism in the area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not the fault of the plan itself but the fault of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  or of his Govern- . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lence and has not experienced any real trouble which could be associated with or blamed upon in any way the broad foundation principles of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here again the forward thinking of the Austalian Labor Party and its Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should be applauded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must always be a serious consideration in any change in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy or programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the principles which are embraced in the policy of the Australian Labor Party are no different today from what they were in the very first years of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party has always remained firm in the belief that an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy must be administered with tolerance, sympathy and understanding, and I am . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very certainly the time is overdue for a full scale, but a fairly quick examination of the whole field to determine just what should be done in the area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the expenditure of $66,286,000 as set out in the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Government on its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is one of the most important matters that we have to administer as a Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course there are critics and in the main this criticism centres on the proposition that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inhibits economic growth, that our policy is based on just getting numbers and ignores quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other critics regard <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as the cause of pollution, of the urban sprawl, inflation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some critics say that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the root cause of Australia’s problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflation is neither confined to nor worst in Australia and the other great countries of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is simply some kind of numbers game is completely wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great damage could result from Australian politicians speaking in neighbouring countries without exercising the utmost care to be factual about Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has travelled in these countries knows that there are many misleading stories about Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, I have been in the East, the Near East and the Far East and I have heard these stories from the indigenous people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, great difference of opinion among honourable members on the Opposition side and they are definitely divided over their <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 <span class="highlight">immigration</span> position on the Opposition side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has run on sound lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Opposition was divided on its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that a full scale debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cannot be conducted under the circumstances which prevail in an estimates debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  believe it is important that from time to time we should examine the accepted norms of policies such as <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been largely bipartisan over almost the entire period of mass <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia since the Second World War, the policy itself, its aims and the manner in which it is carried out have not been subject to question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because most members of this Parliament are agreed basically on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy there has been no real examination of the cause and effect and the results of our post war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a worthwhile exercise and in the national interest for a real inquiry to be conducted into our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, the effects, the benefits and such detractions as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has brought about in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some time ago, about the beginning of 1970, Professor Wheelwright claimed that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy was absorbing such a large amount of available investment capital within Australia in order to provide the social structure to cope with an unnatural increase in population that the nation had been forced to allow overseas capital to obtain control of substantial proportions of our industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it would be worth while to examine whether the conventional wisdom which has existed for so many years in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is in fact wisdom or just blind ignorance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disarray was in due course brought under control when we saw the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  - the former shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - leading for the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He proposes as the greatest diversion in Australia since the Snowy River project a joint select committee to look into the operation of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact this Liberal-Country Party Government has any problems with inflation they are only meagre compared with the problems which obviously are faced by the Labor Party - and the personalities in that Party which clash - on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in commenting on the gratuitous intervention of the British Race Relations Board and the gratuitous advice we go from them on the matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> the right honourable member for Melbourne said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British political parties, both Conservative and Labour, have made a hell of a mess of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and now they appear to want to pass it on to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In commenting in this House on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, in conjunction, in fact, with his Leader, the honourable member for Grayndler went further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I maintain that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should bc based on the principle laid down by successive governments since Federation, that we need to maintain a homogeneous population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On  Mr Fraser’s  weekly radio and television programme he said that  Mr Daly  had every right to decide that the misinterpretation of his attitude to Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme had gone too far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  said that he was baffled by  Mr Whitlam’s  moving an amendment to  Mr Daly’s  motion seeking the right to speak, the amendment being that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should also have the right to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  gratuitous advice on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to the Prime Minister of Singapore is fairly well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am referring to  Mr Dunstan,  the Premier of South Australia, who sent to the Prime Minister of Singapore a telegram which referred to close and most effective ties between Singapore, South Australia and the Australian nation as a whole in trade, culture and lastly <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He rejected claims that his statement would breach ALP <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 will now quote, as I have been doing - this time from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition made last Sunday in which he reiterated Labor’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the first thing I want to do is to compliment not so much the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  or his Department, but all the Australian community for the way in which it has taken these people to its bosom, accepted them and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my own mind I have the feeling that if we suddenly reduce the intake of migrants we might create unemployment; that in fact the pressures (hat <span class="highlight">immigration</span> creates might well be some of those that have created full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even under the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the administration of that Department was pretty good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the time has come for a proper evaluation of all the things that come under the heading of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and that that will be achieved only if we do it in a bi-partisan way as a result of a committee of inquiry, as we have advocated here this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, owing to the lateness of the hour I will not mention many of the figures which I intended to mention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer to the approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking in Perth last weekend, he attacked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  who was not in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He complained that there had not been a full scale debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for the last  5i  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Mr Daly)  it could be said that we did have a bipartisan <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While stating that its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy shall be administered with the avoidance of discrimination on any ground of race, or colour or nationality, the same Labor Party Conference adopted a policy to advise Australian mothers to limit their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it is better to retain control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as this Government has done, to be able to draw back the numbers of migrants rather than to be confronted with a flood of people over which there can be no control concerning race, colour of skin or nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator Cotton)  has said that there have been applications for 50,000 Indians to enter Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many thousands of migrants already are living happily in Australia and the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the tour folded they suddenly discovered <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I am right in saying that 12 months ago I was probably one of the first in this Parliament to question <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Prime Minister of the day,  Mr Gorton,  a question about it, and at that time he said he was shocked to hear that a member of the Labor Party was questioning <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 12 months the whole of our community has been questioning <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not said categorically that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are asking for now is that there be a breathing space so that we can have another look at where we are going in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the best contributions made this evening was that made by the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  because he sees the weaknesses and the strengths in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is  a  moderate approach towards <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, on this issue there are deep divisions between the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  and it was those divisions which led to the dismissal as shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of the honourable member for Grayndler, a man who has been described by his leader in this Parliament as one of the best informed men on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The leader of the Australian Labor Party in fact said of the honourable member for Grayndler, in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, that one could not fault him on that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to the amendment before the Chair, there is in the view of the Government no need for a joint select committee to inquire into the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s achievements in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> are a matter of record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, at the last Australian Citizenship Convention the Leader of the Opposition paid public tribute to ‘the efficiency and humanity of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> under a succession of able Ministers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there has been in recent times some misunderstanding - I hesitate to use the word misrepresentation’ - of the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> cannot and must not be viewed in isolation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The social, economic and demographic effects of these different components of population change vary quite substantially and changes in the size or structure of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme cannot entirely offset the effects of changes in the other factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The particular importance of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> lies in the fact that, of all the elements of population change, it is the one most effectively influenced by Government action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to say tonight that the Government has in the national interest adopted the broadest possible approach in formulating <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and in giving effect to those policies through annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has developed extremely comprehensive consultative machinery on all aspects  ot  <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to stress that Government sponsorship of research into various aspects pf <span class="highlight">immigration</span> dates back for more than a decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These ‘ are imaginative and far-reaching initiatives, but they form only part of a quite impressive body of research applied or in progress throughout Australia into the various aspects  of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian National University has just published a bibliography and digest which constitutes impressive evidence of the scope and depth of research into <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government will continue as it has in the past consistently and successfully to review its annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes, to relate those programmes to Australia’s needs, the availability of suitable settlers and our capacity to integrate them on arrival here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what has been said tonight by Opposition membersI stress that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes are not rigidly conceived, mathematically calculated and solidly pursued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  will continue that process of review as circumstances may continue to change in future years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not comment on the question of the non-European policy which has been mentioned on both sides of the Committee, except to say in a quite reasonable way to the Opposition that if the Opposition believes that its policy is misrepresented it should take the opportunity to spell that policy out clearly with a sense of detail which has been lacking in every contradictory utterance which has come forward from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  the honourable member for Grayndler, the Premier of South Australia, the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-56-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They applied for residence and approval was given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable gentleman recall saying on ‘Monday Conference* this week that this postponement was an automatic outcome of an administrative decision which he himself took as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711103_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that we have the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  who, if he had not been deported, is at least temporarily away from the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly both New Zealand and Canada do not worry to the same extent as we do about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that our Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has 318 people looking after the migrants that we are trying to get not only from Great Britain but also from Europe, but even in that area only approximately 100 of these people are Australian based personnel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we are reducing our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme I believe that the personnel associated with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be reduced from the 318 that I have mentioned to a much lesser number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister should say to our Minister for Foreign Affairs: ‘You, Foreign Minister, take over the affairs of Australia House; segregate the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Department of Trade and Industry and the other similar departments that are represented at Australia House, but for goodness sake, Foreign Minister, take over the responsibilities, cut the staff to a reasonable number and compare achievements with those of Canada and New Zealand’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the number of personnel serving in Australia House I point out that of the total of just over  1,000,  some  380  are engaged in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> side of the activities of that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of this <span class="highlight">immigration</span> activity is illustrated by the number of personnel there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  who usually represents in this chamber the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson),  is away at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he confer again with his colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, with a view to having this reciprocity implemented in the interest of both Australia and Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my reply of 20th August 1970 to representations made to me on behalf of  Mr William  Martin by the honourable member for Calare I informed him that I would discuss with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the matter of the loss of German pension when the recipient becomes an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (4) It is understood that in the course of discussions on a wide range of subjects, at Bonn in July 1969, an official of the West German Ministry of Labour requested the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to take up with the Australian Goverment the question of a social security agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-30-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A youngster was virtually made to stay at a school because of some interpretation of the policy of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - a ridiculous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An argument we used to hear frequently, and still do, about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was that we must have an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme so we will have people to do our work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711123_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government and therefore the housing of these people should become a Commonwealth responsibility and the Government should provide funds for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711124_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He accepted the wine tax and voted for it as did the remainder of the South Australian quartet comprising the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  and the honourable members for Wakefield and Boothby  (Mr McLeay). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the honourable member for Grayndler questioned his Party’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and he had very good reason to question it in view of some of his Party’s policies which seem to be shunted around at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>ls ii also a fact that the late  Mr Leo  Buring, a distinguished Australian citizen who was naturalised on his father’s certificate when he was only 7 years old, was compelled by the New Zealand <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department, when he visited that country about 12 years ago at the age of 70, to also suffer the indignity of having to report to  a  police station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were industrial affairs - 1 am sure the Labor Party has not forgotten about that one; defence; <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - the honourable member lor Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  would not have forgotten that one; cities and decentralisation; education; and health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, we took action to ensure that we would reduce the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inflow in order to minimise the impact upon employment figures because over the Christmas period approximately 190,000 people will come into the work force from secondary schools and from tertiary education levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But one  of  the situations that have developed as a result  of  some  of  our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies is that a man can come here from  America,  take up a position in Australia with one  of  these companies and replace Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After we had had serious fights with the Victorian Department of Education about the requirements of that Department in that teachers had to come to Australia for an interview - one of them was teaching in Ethiopia - the Victorian Teachers Union doubted the applicants’ qualifications; then we had our final tussle with that remarkable revolutionary, the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not presume that if this qualification were deleted the Commissioner would start appointing right and left the yellow peril, which is the term sometimes used in discussions on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies; but he should, if he is an intelligent man, be able to select good non-British subjects as teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understood from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  only a week ago, and from his 2 predecessors, that the primary citizenship is Australian, but we are now asked as a Parliament to enshrine in law something which is quite ludicrous in the light of reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would ask him to look a little more closely at his own proposals and attitudes towards the Australian population, the people involved in its development and his proposals for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, Australian families, the numbers of children born in Australia and the rights of Australian children, old, young and even unborn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If anything it would have more old age pensioners who had originated overseas because America’s main period of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was in the early part of the 20th century and many of the people who migrated to the United States then have now become eligible for the old age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720323_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I welcome his agreement that in such matters as <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, of which he was speaking, Australia should, to quote the words of my Party’s platform, avoid discrimination on grounds of race*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Phillip Lynch, then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, attended a meeting of the Central Committee of the United Croatian Associations  of  Australia on April 3, 1970 … At the April 10 celebrations of last year,  Mr Ian  Fuller deputised in Sydney for  Dr Malcolm  Mackay, then Minister for  the Navy; while in  Hobart  Dr  Bob  Solomon   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that this would have been known since a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> attended a meeting, and on the wall behind the platform on which he stood were 2 portraits: One of Queen Elizabeth II and the other, he thought, of the  president  of the association whose meeting he was attending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet we find that subsequent Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and some of their colleagues have attended similar celebrations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seemed to be something of a surprise to some of them because every time this kind of motion is launched by the Opposition, around the headlines of the world goes the suggestion from responsible people in Australia that we are racists, and then those who have not visited this country or studied our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws get an impression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said - he had not consulted the Government - that it was only the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws that were racist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is something that our own people tend to say, because in Ceylon  -  I have studied the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws of Ceylon and other countries of the South East Asia area - I know that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws are a good deal harsher than are ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has the call. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I suggest that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> might withdraw the last remark that he made about the honourable member for Lalor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A recognition of these fundamental truths has until recently bound the major parties in this Parliament together in a bipartisan approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before dealing with the subject matter of the debate I would like to reply to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  who made another one of his wild statements during which he looks vaguely across the chamber and cannot remember the names of any of the honourable members sitting opposite him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have served with the honourable member for Grayndler on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> committee of the Australian Labor Party and I can assure the House that there has never been any division between us on that committee on any issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is not surprising, because  Mr Robert  S. Clark - who runs one of the most racist organisations in this country, the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association, and who mainly specialises in helping the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  to beat  Mr St  John for representation in this Parliament - is a prominent member of the Liberal Party in the electorate of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and one of his most prominent helpers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has stated quite clearly in its policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that one of the points to be taken into consideration is whether any frictions will arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not consider that being described as being cosmopolitan, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> described certain members of the Opposition - if that means not being extremely nationalistic - is an insult as the Minister and the Russians do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to the preservation of the homogeneity of our people and the preservation of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> restriction laws, my views are like the laws of the Medes and the Persians - they are unchanged and unchangeable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Following the recent discussion on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, can the Minister assure the House that there will be no change in the Government’s policy of facilitating the reunion of families through sponsored <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, while at the same time continuing the policy of Commonwealth sponsorship of migrants from countries from which there is no tradition of family sponsorship? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course sponsored <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is no new thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a very important part of our programme, almost since the beginning of the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose to continue sponsored <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as long as there is an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, particularly as it affects family reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason why it has been necessary to raise the point that sponsorship patterns differ widely from country to country is that the Australian Labor Party has announced that it will base its approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> virtually on sponsorship by friends, relatives and employers in Australia alone, in other words, virtually confining it to sponsorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a situation in which the apologists for the Labor Party tend to say that whatever the Labor Party says it will do things will remain the same, I think it important to say in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that if the Labor Party does what it says it will do there will be a significant and radical change in the composition of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I take this opportunity to commend the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  for the action which he took on behalf of  Mrs Gable  and her 2 sons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not go into detail but, as a result of representations made by the Minister,  Mrs Gable  and her 2 sons have now been naturalised and an unfortunate incident in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been cleared up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I informed the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about this letter and he said that it was really the concern of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen),  to whom I gave a copy of the letter because I hoped that the responsible department would take some action in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister tell me also whether it is not the normal practice for a captain of a foreign ship before sailing to report missing a crewman to the responsible Customs official who, in turn, reports the incident to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities and State police, who endeavour to effect the arrest of the deserter by warrant with a view to his deportation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to review urgently the briefing given in South America to single girls applying to come to Australia, to ensure that they do not leave Peru and other countries with the wrong picture of Australia and the conditions here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This task forces could be made up of personnel retained by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - very able and skilled personnel - and also representatives of the Good Neighbour Council in the 2 cities of Sydney and Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am grateful to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for being here tonight to listen to the report compiled after a full and extensive discussion of the problem with a representative cross-section of the girls concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720518_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During his absence the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Dr Forbes,  will be Acting Minister for Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has twice visited Australia since the agreement was signed, the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did not see fit to visit Italy during his extensive overseas tour in October and November, aor in fact did he visit Yugoslavia, Malta or Turkey, with which negotiations have been proceeding for some years, as I have quoted, nor Denmark, Ireland and Spain with which negotiations have since been initiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who interjects, has not visited those countries and his colleague the Minister for Social Services has not mentioned them as being countries to which approaches have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite these rhetorical speeches which are prepared for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about Australia’s migrant intake, the fact is that the migrant intake is going down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a feature which we ali accept - the decline in the volume of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of the Australian Labor Party advocate and require that the Commonwealth Government should withdraw from the search for migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of the Australian Labor Party would mean significantly fewer migrants coming to Australia from such countries as Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and Malta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out also that the experience of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> gauged over 25 years of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was that migrants generally waited more than 8 years before deciding to apply for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Commonwealth in this sphere has been limited, in the words of my colleague the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  a previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to vigorous advocacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  gave us interesting but sometimes misleading information about <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, he did not get very close to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me say to him at the outset that migrants in Australia are not offended with the role of the Australian Labor Party or of the Opposition in this Parliament in the migration programme because they recognise that there probably would never have been an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme had it not been initiated by this Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know about the association which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> might have with the various migrant groups, but I receive very considerable correspondence from many of these organisations indicating their concern about many aspects of Australian life and their desire that those aspects might be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I inquired by way of question placed on the parliamentary notice paper as to the reason, the Prime Minister said that neither he nor the department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had the address of the Federation of Netherlands Societies Ltd. Every honourable member on this side of the House, by virtue of the intensive contact he has had with that Federation and other migrant groups, would know not only the secretary’s address but also the address of some members of the Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  threw considerable doubt on figures provided by the Leader of the Opposition on the general question of migration and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the figures I have quoted have been taken to the nearest thousand and are derived from the consolidated statistics of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for  1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would therefore like the Minister to take this matter up with his colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  and give consideration to amending the Act with a view to paying the Australian pension to all migrants over 80 years of age, after serving a qualifying period of 6 months, as applies to residents from the United Kingdom and New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720525_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However I would like to refer to one matter that the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  raised in relation to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did raise with me the question of the allocation to South Australia and, in fact, wrote to me about it on behalf of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did review the allocation in view of the case put by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Sturt, the South Australian Minister for Forests, the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  and others and we managed to get an additional allocation granted by the Treasury as a special grant to assist South Australia in view of the splendid record it had in the field of forestry during the last programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720530_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and relates to the Asians who have been ordered to leave Uganda and the suggestion that Britain may approach Australia to accept some of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications by Asians in Uganda will continue to be considered on their individual merits in accordance with our non-European <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which is supplementary to the one asked today by the Leader of the Opposition concerning Air Vice-Marshal Hawkins, a distinguished Australian airman who fought for this country during the last war, and the withdrawal of his passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  who is at the table, to convey to the Attorney-General the sentiments that I have expressed and ask him to interest himself in these cases as well as the many others that are not reported because people who have been defrauded do not know where to go to seek protection or have no-one to speak for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I would add, in amplification of what I said then, that Australia’s existing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has allowed and will continue to allow some Asians to migrate from Uganda, in particular persons who are qualified in professions to practise in Australia and who can be absorbed readily in those professions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include economic growth, population growth including <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, defence, development of industry, Aboriginal advancement, development of education, improvement of health facilities and equity in the tax system including estate duty and personal income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720822_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Amongst the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  the right honoruable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  the new shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who deposed the honourable member for Grayndler, and  Mr Don  Dunstan and  Mr Bill  Hartley on the Federal Executive of the Labor Party, there seems to be some confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are also men from Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines and the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission - everything from the Material Handling Advisory Committee to the Australian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council and the advisory committee to the Atomic Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720823_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I appreciate what has been done by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My view on Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and particularly on non-European migration, should be very well known as I have expressed them publicly on many occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Launceston Conference of the ALP, when a slight change was made in the wording of the policy, I expressed my opinion on its interpretation and was  promply  relieved of my responsibilities as ‘shadow’ Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, or in more colloquial terms, ‘sacked’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  speaking on behalf of the Liberal-Country Party Government has left no doubt as to their policy on non-European migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We still have a continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is in relation to structural unemployment and retraining, and the second is in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other matter to which I want to refer is <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be far better to stop <span class="highlight">immigration</span> immediately, except to those people who have guaranteed employment or who are family dependents and do not affect in any way those persons who are in employment already, who are reuniting a family, or who are seeking employment in a restricted market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720824_reps_27_hor79/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the Labor Party believes that Australia should be a patchwork quilt with all the various colours opposing each other, building up hatreds and bringing about a condition within this nation which would not be conducive to a free peace loving people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was reinforced in this view recently when I noted that those States made a statement upon <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which has long been accepted as a Commonwealth function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The listening public of Australia would not believe that what we just heard was a Minister attempting to defend the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden);  rather would they think it was a speech written by someone else and read b&gt; the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before dealing with the latter in more detail I should like to spend just a couple of minutes on the new economic theory in this country which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  - I agree in this particular instance - has described as xenophobic economics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Xenophobic economics holds that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> causes inflation, unemployment, capital loss, depletion of resources, housing shortages, inordinate strains on community facilities, excessively high economic growth and, of course, excessively low economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same people who told us 18 months ago that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> must stop because it costs up to $50,000 per migrant family to establish them by building houses, roads, schools, hospitals, etc., and that it was uneconomic to bring them in because they were really a manpower loss, tell us that we must stop <span class="highlight">immigration</span> because they take all the jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on a large scale does not cause problems, but for goodness sake let us be rational about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They support the admission of Asian and African intellectuals, professionals and business people but repeatedly use value judgment arguments no different from those of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  is in face a restatement, albeit in condensed form, of a statement made by the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  in the Senate the week before last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that the people realised that the Australian Labor Party stands for the abolition of censorship, the recognition of Scientology, the breakdown of the standard of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, the importation of unemployment, because of the stated views of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to tariffs and the revaluation of the Australian dollar and because the Labor Party is pushing for shorter working hours without any regard for increased productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is up to this Government to take immediate steps to stop <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Western Australia until the employment situation eases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that firms such as this should be able to add to the already high unemployment figures that exist in Western Australia or should have any say as to what happens to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt has been answered almost invariably by a kind of pop politics from the other side, as in the disappointing speech made this afternoon by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  and the equally disappointing one from the honourable member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley),  who 1 do not think even knew we were discussing the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the unemployment problems in Western Australia, will the Minister investigate the possibility of immediately curtailing further Commonwealth <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Western Australia except of those persons who have guaranteed employment and housing or to reunite families and will not displace or add to the employment difficulties of people who are already citizens of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he make the additional funds obtained by the curtailment of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> available for relief in the unemployment area until unemployment is relieved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable gentleman would be aware if he has followed the statements made by the Government, the administration of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> pro gramme has been remarkably sensitive to the situation of employment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters I raised in this House were referred by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the Director of Migration in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A conference was held with the girls concerned and representatives of the Good Neighbour Council and the Catholic <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We remember in the last 12 months or so the Leader of the Opposition’s repudiation on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of the honourable member for Grayndler, the architect of Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a good thing that we have an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme because the maternity allowance of $30 to $35 has been unchanged since 1943, almost 29 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The largest increase was 188,000 in 1969-70 but this was a year of very high <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, when net settler arrivals totalled 159,000, including 72,300 workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  made one of the most dastardly contributions I have ever heard in this House; in fact he made no contribution at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the division on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sacked the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  as shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to note that the Government planned to keep the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> quota at 140,000 migrants for the coming year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas the Leader of the Opposition has been most guarded and vague concerning Labor’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, it must be remembered that he replaced his shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is at present sitting at the table on the Opposition side, when he was expounding policies similar to the policy of the Government and that the Labor Premier of South Australia has made a call virtually to open the flood gates to non-European migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720830_reps_27_hor79/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to continue with a vigorous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for the benefit of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  I am glad to say, shares the same sort of views as I had when I held that office, namely, that the Government should do everything possible to put the migrant on the basis of being able to integrate into our community as painlessly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has put forward in this Budget a programme for migrant integration and social welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a person reads an advertisement, the next step is for him to see the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in the United Kingdom to be counselled, to make specific inquiries and to be given literature^ - for example, a pamphlet on wage rates and employment opportunities, which is amended at least 3 or 4 times a year and contains all the information to which the honourable gentleman alluded and which is available to the potential migrant - before even making a decision to apply to come to the country and before coming into contact with a selection officer and a counselling officer who are there to see that the potential migrant has available to him accurate information about current conditions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt concerns the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This letter was written on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer tonight to a matter relating to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I informed the office of the Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  that I would be raising this matter and I had hoped that he would have been here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The child was not subject to any court order in Australia but, had it been, our court order would have been nullified in deference to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws of another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken to officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and they have informed me, rightly or wrongly, that the Department has no responsibility in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know the provisions of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> law relative to this matter, but I should not think they would be so loose as to allow that situation to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws have no provision which will prevent a Maltese national registering a child on his passport without the permission of his wife or the child’s mother, that loophole should be closed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is how our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws stand at the moment they contain a serious loophole which should be closed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> give an assurance that security and screening processes will be applied to prospective migrants from Arab countries to ensure that Australia is kept free from the activities of Arab terrorists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The numbers of single persons and of family groups of particular sizes are available for assisted migrants but, in the case of unassisted migrants, the figures used in this answer represent an estimate made by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720912_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let not the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> laugh that off because she is a practising Christian and a good cleanliving decent girl whom people had no right to grab by the scruff of the neck like a common criminal and shanghai to New South Wales to be incarcerated in a prison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again there is that supercilious look on the face of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that he is distressed, but the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is not distressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720913_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we come again to the impact of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have attempted in Australia, and I do not disagree with it, an increase in population through both <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and natural growth which is an alltime record for any part of the world, or at least any part of what we might call the western democracies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  whose persistence in these matters is, I think, well acknowledged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion is deliberately limited to matters of Commonwealth responsibility, in that this Parliament has the constitutional power to make laws with respect to external affairs, emigration and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and trade and commerce with other countries, for instance, civil aviation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reasons for the increase were the economic and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies commenced by the Chifley Government and outlined in the White Paper on Full Employment in 1945 and subsequent studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The activities of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction - and let me say that the hidden remnants of that postwar reconstruction have been hidden in the archives of the Minister for Trade and Industry’s Department over these long years - and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> saw Australia’s early post-war development off to a good start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720919_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking into account the way in which the Government adjusts its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, it is not correct that in all cases the arrival of migrants lessens the employment opportunities for Australians who are unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last 3 years the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake into this country has been some 300.000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An article states that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> deservedly has a red face about the case which hit the headlines recently when lorfino was unable to support his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes on to say that the publishers are willing to bet that the Iorfino family and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officials dealing with the case were of a certain religious faith and that this may have involved circumvention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, it is not to the credit of that organisation in helping to circumvent the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will well recollect that the inquiry sponsored by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> into the reasons why such a growing higher proportion of migrants are returning home established the major reason as being that social security and social welfare services - covering the broad conspectus of these things - in Australia are so inferior to what are available overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To find a situation where this applies one has only to think of my friend the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  and many other people who, in the interests of the nation, have the capacity to take a courageous decision when it should be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly I wish to deal with the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  has a difficult time making decisions on matters of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, but I must protest at the constant frustration which is being experienced by one of my constituents, a  Mr David  Crane of Rivervale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, despite many requests to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for them to be allowed to migrate to Australia on a full fare paying basis, they have been refused admission to this wonderful country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  to reconsider the situation and to see what can be done to admit the family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720921_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly true that it would not have been possible for Australia to develop, in terms of economic growth, per capita income and employment, without the large scale post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme which has been directed specifically and expertly to satisfying shortages of labour and Australia’s other needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that should a Labor government in Western Australia or a possible future Labor Federal government announce its intention to withdraw from the specific approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that has proved so successful over the years and to confine it purely to the whims of people already in Australia - that policy has been enunciated and was made even clearer recently by the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland - it will be disastrous for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No longer would we have the process by which an expert <span class="highlight">immigration</span> service selects the people with the skills and of the categories we require and the economic growth, advancement and development which Australia has had in the past would not be fired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720926_reps_27_hor80/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Coast Guard Service could appropriately be placed under the control of the Department of Customs and Excise with provisions for adequate liaison with other relevant departments, for example those departments responsible for health, fisheries, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and rescue services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A newspaper report there dealt with the fact that the customs and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials learned of the plot to smuggle the Chinese into Australia and they acted as a result of the information they received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would remind the House, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  who is sitting at the table did this morning, of the comments of the Nimmo Committee in relation to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the phrase which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> accused me of leaving out and so engaging in selective quoting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problem is so serious that, quite apart from the Government’s views on the Labor Party’s scheme, our thoughts on general practitioners and the suggestion that general practice clinics might help to reestablish the standing of the general practitioner is in accord with the views expressed - and I trust that the Minister can find time to read them when he has finished speaking to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  at the table- by the Australian Medical Association study group on general practice in its pamphlet entitled General Practice and Its Future in Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find myself in the position of speaking on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> rather earlier that I had expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Lynch,  said that the Government ‘decided to finance the salary costs of teachers employed to teach migrant children in special classes and the necessary supervisory staff, special training courses for teachers in methods of teaching English as a foreign language, the provision of approved capital equipment of the language laboratory type for special classes, and the provision of suitable teaching and learning materials’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that both the Commonwealth Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  have received a number of deputations on these matters, because the situation in capital cities in particular is so critical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this is not a Commonwealth responsibility but, since <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a Commonwealth responsibility, it is not too much to expect that the Commonwealth should make very firm representations to the States that the rigid educational facilities and staffing establishments in the schools affected should be made more flexible so that the job can be carried out properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This probably sounds pretty self-evident but it certainly needs emphasising.It means that we must expect this Government, through the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to provide within the English language programme that exists in Australia a recognition of the needs of the professional groups in this area where oral communication is so important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My main purpose in speaking to the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is to pay a tribute to the officers of this Department who are stationed overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I was away I took the opportunity of calling on the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> post in every country I visited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to acknowledge the help and the courtesy which was extended to me by the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our overseas <span class="highlight">immigration</span> posts did not just happen; they did not appear like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the future of some of these posts has been placed in jeopardy by some of the critics of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people blame <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for the increased level of unemployment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason they want either greatly to reduce our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake or cut it out completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The records of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake over the years show that in those years in which we had the greatest number of migrants coming to Australia we had our lowest level of unemployment and we also enjoyed some of our greatest levels of prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matters  1  have mentioned are very positive gains which we have made from our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is wrong to attribute unemployment, congestion and pollution to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, as quite a number of people have done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at some of the benefits which we have derived from our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A vigorous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is essential to the development of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is in Australia’s best interests to retain the very efficient <span class="highlight">immigration</span> posts which have been already established overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to some of the tangible benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has contributed to the non-material activities which add to the quality of life in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have in fact permeated the whole life of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  announced earlier this year, quite a number of new measures are proposed both for assessing migrants overseas and counselling them prior to their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have been brought down this year in the atmosphere of a continuing national debate on migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed expenditure this year is an average yearly expenditure by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to confirm the remarks made by the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  about the officers of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of a parliamentary delegation last year I was able to see at first hand the methods of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in Turkey, Yugoslavia, Great Britain, Ireland, Greece and some other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I could be critical of our past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy it would be in this sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past 3 years <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes reached considerably higher levels than previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public debate on a matter as important as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has clearly stated its policy so that the community can formulate informed views on future <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has critics of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main the criticism is that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inhibits economic growth, that our programmes are based merely on getting numbers and ignoring quality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some critics regard <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as the cause of pollution, the urban sprawl, inflation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At times critics give the impression that they believe that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the root cause of everything wrong in Australia and that Australia alone suffers from these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme takes into account changes in the employment situation, availability of housing and accommodation, balance of the sexes, worker dependent patterns, and factors bearing on the successful integration of migrant groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I do not want to raise the propositions to which I referred in my speech on the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not usually take time in this House to congratulate officers of any department, but tonight I wish to refer to one officer of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said to the parliamentary liaison officer for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Sydney that I hoped the election would come soon so that the people who would be put in charge of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and other departments would realise that they were dealing with human beings and not with files - that it is terribly important for the migrant in Australia and especially for the relative he is trying to bring out here that there is no delay through loss of files. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is terribly important that officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> always remember that they are dealing with human beings - with individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in Iraq must go to Lebanon or Syria to be examined by officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for the purpose of deciding whether they are fit and proper persons to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make a special plea to the Minister and to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to realise that the Department is dealing with people who are for practical purposes refugees, political or religious refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recently wrote to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> concerning a case in which the relatives of a person who has been rejected for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> are living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to go out of his way to examine this case and to bring that person to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the two or three minutes remaining to me I would like to repeat a point which arises from the general question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the points that have been raised tonight on whether migrants should be allowed into this country, 1 think to some extent we must realise that some of the opposition to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has developed because of the popularisation of what is commonly known as zero population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But do not let us get carried away with slogans to the effect that the only way we can teach India not to increase its population is by not increasing our population in Australia and then to go on to the next step and say that the only way we can stop Australia’s population increasing is by stopping <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, which has played such an important part in our national development, is to be continued in the 1972-73 financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, of course, to the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  who, as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> during the early post-war years, laid the foundation of what is generally regarded as one of the most spectacular and successful mass migration programmes in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the right honourable member for Melbourne and to the first permanet head of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Sir Tasman  Heyes, must go the main credit for launching this monumental scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute also to the dedicated Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and officials who have served Australia so well over the years since that time and who are serving Australia now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party at its Launceston conference last year made a radical departure from its traditional <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy by proposing to abolish all forms of discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The longstanding bi-partisan policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has unfortunately been abandoned officially by the Australian Labor Party, and its chief spokesman for many years on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters, the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  has been unceremoniously dropped because he does not agree with the proposed removal of all forms of discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wish to raise three or four matters tonight in the consideration of the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but firstly I feel that I must not let the opportunity pass without referring to one of the statements made by the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Drury). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the fact that the Opposition’s bipartisan policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> had been abandoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that remark and say that it is to the credit of the Australian Labor Party that it has cast itself adrift from the discriminatory practices into which this Government has allowed itself to lapse in the interpretation of what we hoped could have continued to be an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that did not discriminate against people for malicious reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to several aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that I believe give the lie to some of the instant policies of the Government of recent times and which indicate very clearly the breakdown of what we hoped could have continued as a fair and reasonable bipartisan policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bowman  Mr Keogh)  asked us to be reassured that the Australian Labor Party will maintain an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which will be in the best interests of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at other countries which have brought in trouble through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no reflection on the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes);  he has to carry out Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to look at the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of some of the colonial powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can be friends with these people and can give them support but we can be taken over not by war but because of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has to be closed down to a great extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just listened to a speech giving views quite the opposite of what has been enunciated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was not that the basis of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of  1945  and  1946? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a few days ago in this House we witnessed the attitude of another Minister as expressed through the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who is the Acting Minister for Health and former Minister for the Army and God knows what else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government hides the figures for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot regard <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in  1973  as it did in  1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking in the House of Representatives on 8th September 1949 the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Calwell,  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Government would lose effective control of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and in particular it would lose control over the composition of the programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Government would be precluded from using the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want particularly to comment on the loss of effective Government control over <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which would result from Labor policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effective control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requires firstly, that the composition of the migrant intake in terms of sources, skills and integration prospects is suitably balanced, and secondly, that action should be taken by the Government as and when necessary to ensure that the numbers and types of migrants coming to Australia are in harmony with our needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these important respects Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies would provide insufficient control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Leader of the Opposition the Labor Party would set a numerical upper limit to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second of the major defects in Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies is that the government would be precluded from using the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With only sponsored migration the government would also be prevented from using the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme as an effective instrument of population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context it is relevant to remind the Parliament that the Government has commissioned far-reaching population studies which are premised on the availabality to the Government of effective control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a means of implementing population policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, regardless pf whether sponsorship is confined to relatives or is more widely based the Labor Party’s policies would mean that firstly the Government would lose effective control of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, if sponsorship were to be confined to relatives <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would fall drastically - so much so that we would face the very real prospect of being unable to make good our own population losses through emigration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, if broader based sponsorships were adopted the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would still fall sharply to begin with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the effects of Labor’s .<span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies on the Australian economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, having voluntarily relinquished effective control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, a government which implemented Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies would be largely powerless to redress the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the case for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is for Australia’s benefit alone then as an advanced, rich country we surely stand condemned for taking only those who are well qualified to fit easily into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the case for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is to help relieve population pressures in the countries of origin then again with our technique of selection we are taking the ones who are a minimal burden to their homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the publication setting out Labor’s policy <span class="highlight">immigration</span> takes up little space, something less than 2 inches, and like most of the Labor Party policies is capable of being interpreted in a number of ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the reason why we get statements from the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  claiming that the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy would continue under a Labor government and such contradictory statements from the South Australian Labor Premier,  Mr Dunstan,  that a Labor government would virtually open the floodgates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720927_reps_27_hor80/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are now 3 honourable members - the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  - who have some concern for primary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this is because the Prime Minister believes that in relation to rural matters, primary industry leaders and the Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Northern Development are always wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it any wonder that  Mr Byrne,  the Victorian Minister for State Development and Decentralisation, Minister for Tourism and Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, said: ‘If I can get 500 Chinese under contract to come to Australia I will get them.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is going and so is the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently I have had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, about the future needs of his Department for Commonwealth hostel accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question may relate to Aborigines, the next to the state of the economy and the third one to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable gentleman who is now at the table, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  had things to say about the admission of British migrants to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to see that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has left the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent weeks the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has made an untold number of statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am becoming sick of opening my mail and finding another 2 or 3 statements on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One area in which I can agree with the former right honourable member for Melbourne and the present Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  is in their <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot have a quid each way on this issue, yet that is exactly what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is trying to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Riverina, when his Party was in Opposition made great play about what the Labor Party would do as far as primary industries were concerned if it were in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Migration Bill 1973 introduced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is strongly supported by the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is to be congratulated for starting to remove the last relic of discriminatory legislation from Commonwealth laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate my friend, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, for this action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a very good Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730313_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the cutbacks in the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, what action is his Government taking to overcome these shortages, apart from the proposals in relation to industrial training initiated by the former Government and which are necessarily not short term in their impact? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave - I table a progress report by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council will be making its final report after these researches into the causes of settler departures have been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - which I like to think of as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Citizenship and Settlement - is already taking action on the progress report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  on the progress report of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House will recall that the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council submitted a similar report to the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in 1967. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask the Minister to consider making a ministerial statement which would set out the full details of the new Government’s approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the basic principles which it is following, the determining factors which influence the total number of migrants which the Government intends to seek to bring to Australia this year and their impact upon the whole migrant program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I stated that migrants’ contributions to Australia’s economic growth are important by any standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we invite the Minister, through his Ministry - 1 am sure he will be anxious to do this - to provide the House with an opportunity to debate the whole question of the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No responsible government should abrogate its responsibilities by allowing the size and structure of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to be determined simply by the uncoordinated decisions of thousands of individuals here and abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Government combined 2 processes in its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program - sponsorship programs designed to encourage family reunion and actively seeking migrants under government sponsorsip to fulfil those needs not met by family sponsorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to restrain himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To cease <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will not solve the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second double standard, if I may use that expression, under which the Labor Party is operating may be seen from a comparison of the so-called health policy of the Labor Party with its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the Labor Party has a new policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to quote from one of the many statements made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  and so far as I can see the only clear statement he has ever made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphasisin future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs will be on sponsorship, and family reunion will be given a high priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, on the one hand, the Australian Labor Party wishes to control the natural increase of Australian born children while on the other hand allowing the uncontrolled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of people into Australia, irrespective of their country of origin and including nonEuropeans, merely on a family basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is sitting at the table looking as if he will give forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730314_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, does this announcement reflect the only reply to the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that there was to be allocated a sum of $500m available for long term lending at 3 per cent interest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I could have said today or at any time that I heard the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  say that he would import one million Japanese to work in the Riverina district picking f r ait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I wrote to the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  to the Minister for Primary Industry and to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  because of his interest in the wine industry and in the fruit industry, pointing out this anomaly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  on the removal the other day of the discriminatory sections dealing with Aboriginals that existed in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also 1 wish to refer to the remarks of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who talked about jobs for the boys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I am surprised at the tenor of the question asked by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition because the records of my Department indicate that he when Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was deeply concerned at the activities of criminal elements in our community, a small group of people in the total migrant intake but nevertheless too many because one person in our community who is addicted to violence is too many in terms of the acceptance of these activities by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition used strong terms and took strong action to deal with what he had evidently felt was a lack of government action and a lack of action by the appropriate government agencies to curb violence in our country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I said was that the information which had been gathered by the Special Reports Branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had been made available to me immediately on taking office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has received specific continuing instructions that there shall not be considered for migration anyone who has an addiction to or a record of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question which arises from his visit yesterday to an inner suburban school in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am afraid that in some circumstances, if the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> makes funds available to some of these inner city schools for the teaching of English, there will be no accommodation available for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its leader in Germany is one Ante Vukic, whom our Commonwealth police considered such a dangerous man that they advised the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department against granting him a permit to visit Australia in May 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Among the voluminous documents on Suljak and the Australian branch of the terrorist organisation UHNj, which have been tabled today in the Senate and which will be tabled in this place tomorrow, is a letter dated 30th May 1972 from  Mr Davis,  Commissioner of Commonwealth Police, to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A brochure produced by the Special Reports Branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in August 1972 on Croatian extremist activities makes special reference to the UHNj, its organisation in Australia, its activities and its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18th October 1972 the AssistantDirector of the Special Reports Branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> recommended Marincic’s deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a long and carefully argued submission to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> dated 12th November 1972,  Senator Greenwood  reversed the priorities as between the interests of Australia and those of an obvious Croatian terrorist in favour of the latter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me quote just one passage from this extraordinary letter from the then Attorney-General,  Senator Greenwood,  to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The chief law officer of Australia, the then Attorney-General, must have been familiar with the decision of the High Court in the case of Znaty v. The Minister of State for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Another reported in 1972 Argus Law Reports at page 545. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Judgment in this case was delivered on 25th February 1972, that is, some 9 months prior to the letter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> urging him not to deport Marincic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we assume that  Senator Greenwood  was familiar with this decision - surely he would not undertake to advise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> without familiarising himself with the up-to-date state of the law regarding <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters - we can only reach one conclusion about this conduct in this matter: In order to protect a terrorist from deportation, he misinformed the Minister responsible for the issuance of a deportation order about the legal consequences for the terrorist of such an order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did not grant Marie’s application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, on 3rd December 1969 the Honourable Phillip Lynch, then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, wrote to the then Attorney-General Hughes expressing:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a letter addressed to the AttorneyGeneral and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> dated 6th January 1964, he wrote, in part: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> makes the necessary orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  his verbose and boring Press releases and his striving to make something newsworthy every day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most honourable members can remember the great speeches he used to make on a great variety of high policy matters when he was in Opposition, particularly in respect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one time he was the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730327_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw that despite the protests of several preceding Foreign Ministers, and incidentally Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the then Attorney-General had not accepted their advice or pursued the inquiries which they had raised with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the timely action taken by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a service is now rendered to migrants who are experiencing difficulties of communication in matters of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this action by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, will the PostmasterGeneral give consideration to having the telephone number of the service placed in the telephone directory with a similar status to emergency calls which are made by dialling 000 free of charge? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question supplementary to that asked of the Prime Minister by the honourable member for Gippsland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only decision that can be made is made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the advice of many organs of government and we will be proceeding with justice and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must feel very sympathetic for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that the terms of the speech put down by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> receive very wide coverage throughout his electorate so that his position can be well judged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wimmera will address the Minister as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and not as the honourable member for Riverina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is my answer to the interjection of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has come into the chamber, because there are one or two things that I would like to say to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote from an article which appeared in the Griffith ‘Times’ on 22nd December and in which the honourable member for Riverina, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, quoted what the Prime Minister  (‘Mr Whitlam)  said to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After criticising the previous Government, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was further reported as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will carry no weight with the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  or at least with the people who elected them on the last occasion but will think better of it on the next, because they know that they have now elected to this Parliament a Government that is concerned only with votes in large cities and is not concerned with the remoter country towns, provincial cities or the people who live in the rural communities - not just the farmers but the totality of people who live outside the great metropolitan areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as (d) is concerned, detailed statisticsin the form requested are compiled and published quarterly by the Bureau of Census and Statistics  and  by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-36-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which I address to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, concerns the national population inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were: The Department of Foreign Affairs, the AttorneyGeneral’s Department, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Commonwealth Police and ASIO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this and to prevent many migrant children from growing up to become secondclass citizens, I propose to consult my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, on ways and means of reviewing the Child Migrant Education Program in conjunction with State and independent school authorities, so that it will fully meet the needs of migrant children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will know and the House will know that the survey of child migrant education was initiated by the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and myself because we were concerned about many of the problems that had been revealed in the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why could not a telephone call have been made to  Sir John  Bunting,  Sir Keith  Waller,  Mr Harders  of the Attorney-General’s Department,  Mr Armstrong  of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Davis,  the Commonwealth Police Commissioner, or  Mr Barbour,  the Director-General of Security? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So did the present Leader of the Opposition as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable gentleman is either playing with the House and the nation or has forgotten to confer with his colleagues, because on 3rd December 1969 his  deputy,  the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch),  who was then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, wrote to the then Attorney-General and said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bombing attack last week on the Yugoslav Embassy in Canberra … the evidence of  a  deliberate attempt to fire the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Offices at Barton on the evening of 1st December - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a warning by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the then Attorney-General of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was written by the honourable member for Flinders, the present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition who was at that time Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, it does not matter at all what the pretext is for violence: Violence in our society must always be condemned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Migration Act, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has authority to exclude from Australia any persons who are not members of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> here and overseas are under standing instructions in this matter and I have re-emphasised those instructions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and sought the reasons why this man had been refused naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the credit of the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  this mistake has been corrected and the man will be naturalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  that if the irrelevancy of the Prime Minister in this debate was exceeded at all it was exceeded by the contribution which the honourable gentleman made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say without any sense of real offence to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that he seemed more at pains to defend his own actions which have led to such hysteria in the migrant community than to defend the Attorney-General in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn finally to comments made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  because he has been at great pains to clear his own name and the actions in which he has been concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That concept does not lie very easily with the concept of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  of the family of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could be the wine coloured suit man or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but I will always know him as the bubbling, popping member for Riverina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government introduced this measure to placate the honourable member for Riverina - the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one to step in and trample on local investment, but what I say is that I do not believe that the welfare of every beer drinker in Australia who wants to buy a bottle should be put below that of the sectional interests of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730410_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not seek registration they can, after 5 years here, simply notify the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that they want to be citizens; and they thereupon become citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just 25 years since the first Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, now the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, introduced into this House, with great and justifiable pride, a Bill which for the first time created in law the status of Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice from the most recent consolidated statistics of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that for the period 1945 to 1972 inclusive the numbers of migrants regarded as permanent  and long term arrivals, by country of last residence, are as follows: Greece  210,000,  Italy  404,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the credit of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  that he has introduced a system whereby a migrant in Melbourne can telephone and receive immediately the services of a linguist who can interpret and explain legislation such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security to give heed to my suggestion - and to pass it on to his colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - that special facilities should be created in these areas to inform the migrants about such matters as portability of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is informative to look at a progress report on an inquiry into the departure of settlers from Australia compiled by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council’s Committee on Social Patterns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examination of this shows that it reflects the lower proportion of refugees in current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - that is, refugees tend to stay more than other migrants - the greater ease of travel in recent years, the strong economic attraction of western Europe, and the growing number of skilled and highly qualified persons who, as part of an increasingly mobile international community, often move from Australia after a few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A resettlement committee comprising officers of the Departments of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, External Territories and Labour, will oversight the arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that I have asked the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council to give continuing attention to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>certainly hope to use the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to help correct the temporary imbalances in one or two groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to assure the honourable member and the House that we will certainly use the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to the best extent that we can to correct the imbalances which exist in one or two ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difference between my Government and its predecessors is that we are trying to solve the matter and at last we have a Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, an Attorney-General and a Foreign Minister who are co-operating to that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because naturally I am concerned about any reduction in services to newly arrived migrants, I have asked the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Publicity Council to look at the whole question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very instructive to see that there was no harmony and no co-operation at all between the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the former AttorneyGeneral and the former Foreign Minister on this very important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister who ultimately generates the demand for housing and who maintains the long term underlying demand is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is cutting away the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest to the Minister for Housing that he should be in very close consultation with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is highly preoccupied with hi.-‘ thought that fine feathers make fine birds, but he should endeavour to work in very closely with housing operations over the whole continent and see that he does co-operate and bring bis programs carefully in line with future housing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(b) As at 31st March 1973 125 persons had been deported from Australia on my authority since I became Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 19th December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-32-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister will know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> announced recently that 7 persons have been deported to Yugoslavia during part of the period of his Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>; it is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs because it involves an agreement between Australia and other countries in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  gave an historical account of the matter which revealed the consistent policies of the previous Government to downgrade the Australian national identity, to downgrade Australian nationalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a thread, a pattern running through all those actions, all those steps or lack of steps by the previous Government, compared with what the present Government has been doing and all the initiatives coming from the Prime Minister and all the initiatives coming from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, about which 1 have spoken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the $500m for rural loans at 3 per cent about which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  howled through the countryside trying to delude sincere people that this was the treatment they would get? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not getting any help - so far, at any rate - from the promise of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  of a loan of $500m at an interest rate of 3 per cent to he!p primary producers out of their difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> cannot for much longer be expected to supply great numbers of professional, technical and skilled workers necessary in these fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole of the associated problems of determining the target are examined by the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, the level of migration is a matter for recommendation by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council is considering all of the factors to be taken into account in determining the level of the intake for next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter will also be dealt with by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Prime Minister will approve of that Department at its most senior level joining the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council so that the needs of decentralisation will be considered particularly by the Government in the migration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that in future the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council will have a representative at the most senior level, I repeat, from the Department of Urban and Regional Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which I address to the Prime Minister, follows on 2 questions asked by my Leader of the Treasurer and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, both of whom read in this morning’s Press statements on policy affecting their own portfolios by 2 other Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730508_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this context, recognising the importance of citizenship, that we debate the Government’s latest legislative initiative in the area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation seeks to remove the position of preferment which British migrants have enjoyed since the inception of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the Government alleges a desire to remove discrimination in various pieces of legislation, particularly the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program; on the other hand, it continues legislation, particularly in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> area, which in fact perpetuates a number of those provisions which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  could well have removed if he was prepared to take upon himself the burden of undoing any sense of preferment “which is currently enjoyed by British citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he seeks to bring down some universal application across the board in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, perhaps I could put into his mind, if only in passing, the question of the visa system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall the Minister’s second reading speech - my colleague the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes),  a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, may also recall it - he sought to put the criticism very much on the shoulders of other members of the Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the days of first settlement <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been a feature of Australia’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years since, even as the base of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has broadened as never before, British migrants have continued to be the cornerstone, the very real base, of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain the Minister would be the first to recognise that the pattern of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ought to be at the rate of integration in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve that end Australia should continue the position of preferment which has characterised that relationship, particularly having regard to the overall basis of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well imagine the feelings of the present Prime Minister with his Napoleonic arrogance and his sense of divine destiny, but I can tell the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  that those expectations might well be ‘hope springs eternal’ so far as the Prime Minister is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It indicates a failure by the Minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the Government to put before this House and the people of Australia a cohesive and meaningful <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister knows full well that some weeks ago he was deliberately challenged - I confess the use of the word ‘deliberate’,  Mr Speaker  - to bring down in this House a comprehensive statement of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of record that since he assumed the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> portfolio, the Minister has been one of the Government’s most prolific purveyors of what is loosely called news. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fee’ a little embarrassed for the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who are here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this country are unparalleled in their dedication to duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel embarrassed that I should be making these comments because, as my colleague the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes),  points out what a terrible time it must be for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when the British Government is revising its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rules the British migrant to Australia expects a clear and definite revision of Australian citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this is an indication of the needs of modern <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, as individuals desire to become a part of another country within the framework of its laws and constitutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  reeks with nauseating hypocrisy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just who does the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> think he is kidding? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I had stated that sort of thing when I was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the bright young men of the Press would have laughed me out of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Minister fiddles, or rather talks, our traditional <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is crumbling into ruins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mesmerised by the Minister’s words, people are not aware that his actions have seriously reduced the supply of good quality British migrants of European origin, that the composition of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has changed rapidly so that there no longer is a predominance of people from western Europe, Britain and North America of European descent arriving in Australia under the program; that the proportion of people with skills and professional qualifications has fallen and given way to people who have no other qualification than a relative in Australia who is prepared to sponsor them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been doing while he has been talking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it means in essence is that while the Minister has been big-noting himself by claiming the previous Government’s initiatives in migrant integration as his own, and emphasising the importance his Government attaches to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, he is by his actions in relation to the program storing up formidable integration problems for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already exposed the explanation given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for the hypocritical humbug that it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has used words during his speech which have likened the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to Hitler. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  will be able to deal with such a racist speech when he rises during the course of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> we heard this evening adequate reason for us to say with every certainty that the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was in a shambles because of the attitude of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to appreciate the massive task that the present Minister had to face on assuming his portfolio in setting out to lift the standard of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in the eyes of the rest of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Government seeks to rid the nation of the inconsistencies, inequalities and discrimination that we believe should no longer be allowed to exist when we are seeking to bring people from various countries and to welcome them as citizens in their own right in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition were not so biased in its acceptance of the fact that this Government has been prepared to do what its predecessor had not been forthright enough to attempt, despite the statements that previous Ministers and the present leaders of the Opposition made when they were in office, it would acknowledge that the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been prepared to tackle this problem and to recognise the fact that these things need to be done speedily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit it is more than expecting an immigrant only to settle into the Australian community for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  spoke of the proud record of the United Kingdom-Australia relationship, but the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the United Kingdom towards Australia certainly is not a proud one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to read to the House an extract from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the United Kingdom presented in the House of Commons on 25th January by the Secretary of State for the Home Department,  Mr Robert  Carr, which is reported at page 654 of the House of Commons Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After talking about the interdependence of Commonwealth countries, the United Kingdom, the colonies and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this in mind, it is all the more important to reduce the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of citizens of other countries - both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth - to the inescapable minimum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard of this preferment or alleged entitlement given by the United Kingdom to Australian citizens, but in fact under the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws of the United Kingdom Australian citizens do not have any automatic entitlement to United Kingdom citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the economics side, the decision of a lot more people to remain in Australia after having arrived here means a great saving to this country in terms  Of  the cost of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, housing and assimilation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned earlier a statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy by the Secretary of State for the Home Department in the United Kingdom speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In New Zealand, which would be a sister country to Australia in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, renunciation is not required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter I would like to mention is the citizenship ceremony, the emphasis on it in the Bill and the importance that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has been giving to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the postwar <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme started nearly 4 million migrants have come to live in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that every country which has embarked upon an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has had this experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Armitage)I call the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was rather amused to listen earlier this evening to some honourable members on the Government side of the House condemn out of hand previous Ministers now on this side of the House and heap tons of praise upon the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who is wandering around the chamber at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, as this House would be well aware, that the studies by Professor Borrie, and other investigations to provide the facts necessary to determine future patterns of migration, were announced on 26th June 1970 by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was elected to this House in 1969 and set about convincing the Italian Embassy, the Maltese High Commission and anyone in the migrant community whose ear he could blow into that he was a great worker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should admit that the British migrant is different from the Italian, the Greek and the Yugoslav. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> with his purple suit and dark hair is jumping around like a day-old cockerel, drawing everyone’s attention to the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I disagree entirely with the censorious remarks directed by the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must pay some credit to the efficiency of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in Australia in the manner in which they issue passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing human nature as I do, I know that the most foolproof scheme that can be implemented in any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office or bank is not foolproof unless the honesty of those enforcing the scheme or carrying out their duties is beyond reproach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this should be applied not only to people in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office, about whom I am not making serious allegations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that I should like to see the principle sold to the Australian community and to this Parliament that people obtaining a passport or responsible migration documents should be invited to submit voluntarily their right index finger print or their left or right thumb print. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  for granting me an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a great pity that in the operation of this policy the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has maintained a continued restraint on the level of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the origins of  Mr Calwell’s  administration and the administration of successive Liberal-Country Party Ministers, pursued in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> portfolio, was tremendously important in developing this country in the years after World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead it has returned to the past, particularly the last 2 Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How could any Minister responsible for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and citizenship go out to the million here now and the tens of thousands still coming and draft them off like so many sheep and cattle, saying: ‘You go to the one year pen; you to the 3-year pen; you to the 5- year pen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  when Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, introduced a citizenship Bill in 1969 which showed a progressive outlook for that time by recognising the growing importance of the status of an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730509_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a quick reference might be made to the gulf between the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the present Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the inclusion or the maintenance of the renunciation of all other allegiance, although the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has explained tonight that 18 other countries do not require renunciation of other allegiance, we in Australia are in a peculiar position at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind one of the deplorable consequences of the actions of the ‘Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is that the future homogeneity of the Australian population could well be prejudiced if the trend towards reducing the inflow of a minimum of 50 per cent of the migrant intake from the United Kingdom be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of course a new homogeneitey; it develops as our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> develops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is changing the emphasis and I am quite concerned that, in the trends towards the reduction of the meaningfulness of the difference between a British citizen and an Australian citizen which this Bill reflects, we are denigrating the maintenance of this homogeneity which is such an important part of the Australian nation today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the alternatives to the present oath was not considered satisfactory in its present form by the citizenship sub-committee of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council which I asked to look particularly at this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This impression, I am glad to say, is fast disappearing since you became Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and for this we thank and congratulate you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to associate myself very sincerely with the remarks of the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  and I hope that even at this late stage the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  may be a little inclined to reconsider his position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  said that renunciation had no legal effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730510_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The formula which will implement the new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies was endorsed and will come into operation in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final point I make is that the meeting was so useful that it was decided to hold a further conference of Australian Government and State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Walsh is  Chairman  of the Great Barrier Reef Study Committee of the Australian Academy of Science,  Chairman  of the Advisory Committee on the Environment to the Australian Government through the Minister for the Environment and Conservation,  Chairman  of the Research Advisory Committee on the Crown of Thorns, past  Chairman  of the Joint CommonwealthQueensland Crown of Thorns Starfish Inquiry and a member of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as an expression of territorial insecurity has now outlived the circumstances which inspired it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know where the idea of a Cities Commission fits in with the Labor Party’s idea of reducing the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake and its advocacy of a zero population growth, limiting families to 2 children, as has been stated by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  on various occasions How do we build a country in that way and how will development survive? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her  particular worry, which I told her I would bring up briefly in Parliament at the first available opportunity, is that she says she wrote to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  in December last and has had a telegram from his secretary to say that the Minister will look into a matter of adoption, but she has not yet had anything else from the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to reply to the honourable member very specifically on one point, namely, that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of the Australian Government is advised in the basic principle relating to this matter by the various State Departments of child welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the previous Parliament I suggested the setting up of a museum or a collection of articles showing Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister investigate the possibility of such a collection and museum showing the history of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program being set up as has been done in the United States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it correct that there has been a change in the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, as reported in the Melbourne ‘Age’ this morning? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also correct to say that the Government has re-started the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no re-starting of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program because the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was that it was decided that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program of the Government in future .is to be finely tuned to the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second was that a decision was made in the face of unemployment at that time not to import unemployment by maintaining the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake at a level which was not commensurate with our national needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no suggestion of re-starting the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program; it was never stopped. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first quarter of this year the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake was something more than 11,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  in a most effective confidence trick, talked during the last election campaign of making low interest finance available to farmers in massive amounts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He mentioned a sum of $500m at 3 per cent interest But the deception did not rest only in the words of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become clear now that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Government as a whole pulled a deliberate and shabby confidence trick on Australian farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who I understand will follow me in this debate, led farmers in Australia to believe that the Government would provide - I use those words deliberately - $500m at 3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> before the election and deliberately so, in what has happened with revaluation compensation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of all people on the Government side of the chamber who should not be saying anything at the present time about creating uncertainty in rural industry it is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  because he more than anybody else has caused the rural crisis because of the statements which he has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Riverina, is reported as follows in the Griffith Area News’ of 1 6 October: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Migration Act a person may be deported only if he is a prohibited immigrant, he is an alien or a migrant who has been convicted of a serious offence or he is an alien or migrant whose conduct has been such that, in the opinion of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, he ought not to be allowed to remain in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The House may recall that even before the Attorney-General made his statement in the Senate I took the opportunity to ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  to give an undertaking, firstly, that no naturalised Australian citizen would be deported, and secondly, that even nonnaturalised Australian citizens convicted of some crime would not be deported to any totalitarian country if they had some political reasons to fear a return to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> gave that undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems of local govern ment have increased due to booming population growth which has been caused partly by an unplanned influx from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should add that I have taken the opportunity of contacting the Perth migrant task force recently set up by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  so that this matter can be listed for their consideration and for their assistance in due course in bringing appropriate warnings to the attention of migrant groups in my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 31 August 1972, the Honourable Member as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, announced that new measures for migrant selection and counselling were being planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My statement of 31 January 1973 referred to the fact that these new procedures ‘had drawn on the expertise of senior officers within the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which had been anxious to improve selection methods and training of selection and interviewing officers’ and announced that they were to be brought into general use in migrant source countries forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-40-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was one of a number of statements in the same vein which were made by the now Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to which I want to refer: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What could have been a sensible attempt to balance, economic growth against other objectives has become a narrow prejudice against <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which threatens to slow our rate of development, limit our room for economic manoeuvre and dry up opportunities for all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restriction of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, in spite of the rationalisations of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  is occurring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>We have been so concerned that today in Canberra a meeting is being held of the adult migrant education officers of the States and the officers charged with educational  responsibilities in the various State branches of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is in line with the misleading answers which he gave to a series of questions which had been directed to him and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  by the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  - questions regarding the proposed visit to Australia of  Mr K.  T. Li of Taiwan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 10 May 1973, during question time, the honourable member for New England directed a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> asking why  Mr Li’s  request had been refused in view of the Prime Minister’s assurance that provided he applied in an unofficial capacity  Mr Li  would be issued with a visa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730530_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  meant when he talked about $500m at 3 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>The previous Government had for many years been concerned and had acted to develop not only a resources diplomacy but also a trade diplomacy, an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> diplomacy, an international transport diplomacy and many other diplomacies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The intention to make such appointments was first discussed however at a meeting with State education authorities on 12 January 1970, and there is reference to my Department’s intention to assess the need to extend its normal integration services, through the provision of interpreters and welfare officers to meet the requirements of the child migrant education program, in the Ministerial Statement made to Parliament on 23 April 1970 by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He spent 4 years as Australia’s first <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Minister and established a program which succeeding Ministers have been proud to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His post-war achievement was marked by the commencement of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme which I believe will immortalise him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1943 Arthur Calwell was promoted to the position of Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  work as the architect of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy at that time was of incalculable benefit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Minister for Information in the years 1943 to 1949 and later  Deputy  Leader and then Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party over a period spanning some 16 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I have a particular memory of Arthur Calwell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His advice to me as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was at all times helpful and in Australia’s best interests I want to record my unqualified respect for this man who in both a personal and professional capacity was one of the great parliamentarians of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was his last portfolio in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased, on behalf of all who served in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> over the years and who serve now, to add to the tributes which have been paid to him today in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> he was an extremely kindly man to immigrant families whose cases were presented to him, as I presented some in my first years here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that he showed the same great courtesy to members of the Opposition of that time in the personal manner in which he dealt with cases which they presented to him as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-As one of the 3 members of this place who were here when the late Arthur Calwell was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I should like briefly to add my condolences on this sad occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was also a member in those years of vibrancy when he was in the full vigour of life and Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the war Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme, with its great contribution to Australia’s development, must go down as his greatest memorial as a member of this Parliament and as a citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who like oratory and Australianism should read his speeches during the early days of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, particularly his speech on the Citizenship Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A. Calwell was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I am faced with the fact that they have established themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware that there is considerable anxiety among applicants for positions as multi-lingual welfare officers with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> at the delay in finalising the appointments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730821_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> read a report in the newsletter Inside Canberra’ alleging an American leader of the Mafia had arrived in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  introduced one measure yesterday with an expectation that it would be considered in detail today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, there was no proper explanation of Government policy given to this House in the form of ministerial statements in many significant areas of Government policy - areas of selfproclaimed Government concern - such as the environment and conservation, urban and regional development and, of course, a field very dear to the heart of the Leader of the House, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House knows full well that he sits in the Ministry with a colleague who has been throughout the length and breadth of Asia proclaiming the concept of a new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister made a statement from Ottawa and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  made statements from diverse parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken the trouble to find out from the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who is also concerned about this matter, what is to happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had some discussions with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about the following statement in the Budget: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and I was reminded of it by the condolence motion on Tuesday for the late Arthur Calwell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also indicated at that time that I would look to see whether anything had been done by my predecessors and I found that the honourable member for Bowman had asked a question of the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, now the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That survey was established by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the former Minister for Education because of the real problems of which people were aware in migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one can criticise the past - I think it is perhaps legitimate for the Opposition to do this - there is probably an under-estimation of the problem that has been placed upon educational authorities by an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that for a while introduced into Australia people who had had only 2 or 3 years schooling even in their own language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-39-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On taking office as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I established a committee on citizenship of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and I took this step to check on the position as revealed in the previous Government’s survey of 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latest recommendation was endorsed by the entire <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, of which  Senator Gordon  Davidson was for so long a distinguished  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will be supporting one part of what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  had to say, namely concerning the Bahamas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that they have contributed much and will contribute much more to the future development of Australia if the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is not continually diminished in size as it appears the Government would want to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I compliment the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  for exposing the rather cavalier remarks of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  in his references to Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the honourable member for Wannon for bringing to the notice of the Australian people the shoddy tactics of the Minister in declaring in this chamber that he was basing his <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy on the result of a gallup poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the honourable member should debate the question which is before the Chair, that is, the amendment moved by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, one can only express amazement and astonishment that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has deleted words which are of great traditional significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of (a) the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, (b) the Postmaster-General’s Department and (c) the Department of Supply, what was (i) the number of persons employed under the Public Service Act and other Acts at (A) 30 June 1971, (B) 30 November 1972 and (C) 30 May 1973, (ii) the number employed who were permanent, temporary or exempt officers or employees, at each of the above dates and under each Act, (iii) the total establishment under the Public Service Act and other .Acts at (A) 30 June 1971, (B) 30 November 1972 and (C) 30 May 1973, (iv) the number of positions oh establishment that were vacant at (A) 30 June 1971, (B) 30 November 1972 and (C) 30 May 1973 and (v) the number of new positions created since 30 November 1972 under the Public Service Act or other Acts, and the number that had not been occupied up to 30 May 1973 or which were vacant at 30 May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-73-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether his attention has been drawn to reports that the great train robber, Ronald Biggs, left Australia with a forged passport made available by an English criminal in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the concern of all the people along the River Murray system in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia for an adequate supply of quality water, could the Prime Minister state his Government’s position and attitude to the completion of the Dartmouth Dam in the light of conflicting statements in the weekend Press to the effect that the Prime Minister said there should be a delay in the project whereas the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said that there should not be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, does he believe that employers’ participation in this vital part of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is being carried out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been traditionally a South Australian industry although significant wineries have been established in the Rutherglen area of Victoria and in the irrigated area of the Riverina electorate of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just come to the point and speak of the humiliation which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  has suffered with the introduction of these Government measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there should be a call from his electorate for him to resign as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because what is being put forward in the Government’s policy is so diametrically opposed to what he made an issue of and stood on as a point of principle in this House and during his election campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thus in 1971 a backbencher was able to claim that during his 2 years in Parliament there had been no full scale debate on urban development, pollution, conservation, education, road safety, transport, social services, the rural crisis, tariffs or <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Northern Development, the honourable member for Dawson, has abandoned his responsibility to his electorate and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  has abandoned his responsibility to his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please do not try to’ reason with .the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Speaker;  he is immune to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my personal opinion that the reduction in our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake must be a factor in the increased rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never believed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to be inflationary, but on the other hand I believe that the numbers of immigrants who have come to Australia together with their dependants have provided a steadily increasing local market for our primary and secondary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How did it get through when two of the people who will be vitally affected if what is suggested comes about are the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the honourable member for Darling  (Mr Fitzpatrick),  who are Labor members and whose electorates are further down the Murray and Mumimbidgee Rivers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I present also a transcript of the conference held at Brisbane on 11 May 1973 between myself and State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the information of the House I would mention that the next conference of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> Ministers will be held in Adelaide on 9 November 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  came into the chamber last night to listen to the tirade of the Leader of the Opposition, splendidly bedecked in a coat of cross-bred merino dorset horn, which every honourable member would remember. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, there were those of us who, as we saw a state of full employment developing within the community, hoped that there would be an increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> quota to keep cost increases reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not had an increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> quota but we do have overfull employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  in his Budget speech devoted 11 lines in Hansard to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and to all the problems which have been uncovered in recent times in connection with the settlement of people in this country in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He capped this 11-line reference to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> with a sad attempt to create further divisions in our society by talking about people disliking migrants - surely a strange phrase in a nation of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would have attempted to give some attention to the very real inadequacies which exist in Australian society at the present time in relation to the people who have come here recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that attention had to be called to the state of the House so late in the speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  as I am sure that members of his own Party who were not here could have benefited by listening to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is so concerned about the future of this country, has made allowance for an intake of migrants this year on a similar basis to that of last year, but of course we have one extra allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> commented that the rural industry was experiencing a boom time, lt certainly is, but that is an act of God, not an act of Gough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I think it very unlikely that any member of the Opposition would advise him to go on television, particularly at a time when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  was on television, because I think that this would show us the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  at the weekend were only a beginning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether his attention has been drawn to an article in the ‘Australian Financial Review’ last Friday on the Australian Government’s English language training scheme for migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply to the honourable member I might say that he has given distinguished service as a member of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and I am very pleased to have a question from him on a matter which obviously interests him and most other members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Commission will give detailed attention to the development in other areas of social policy of an appreciation of the welfare implications of such matters as incomes policy, the taxation system, recreation, housing and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, urban development . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rural sector has been shockingly dealt with in this Budget and I hope that when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  get up in this debate to defend their own decisions as part of the Government they will have some pretty convincing explanations to offer to the House and to their own constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition there will have to be an added impetus in respect of selected <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to build up our building force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriation of $2m fo assist in providing facilities for the teaching of migrant children must be a great help to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question was directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but naturally it concerns my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and I would not have different views on what ought to be done in cases such as the one referred to by the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was misrepresented by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  on the television program ‘Federal File’ on Sunday, 9 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, I wrote to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 3 September referring to an earlier letter of mine of 2 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point of misrepresentation, of course, was that at no time in relation to the correspondence with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did I place any embargo on my capacity to make this matter public, particularly in the circumstances in which the fact of this publication came about as a direct consequence of a copy of a letter which was sent to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That letter, dated 28 August, I believe makes some quite serious allegations which the Minister has not answered and which I believe he should answer because the Opposition has been pressing for a statement from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> progam and it has not been forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you are aware,  Mr Speaker,  we have heard more about Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program from  Mr Grassby  overseas than we have heard from him in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that its practical approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, by curbing the number of immigrants to Australia to 110,000, was long overdue and should have been adopted by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 May 1972 the honourable member for Riverina, the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  said very diabolical things about a wine excise which the previous Government imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether it is a fact that  Sir Robert  Askin, the Premier of New South Wales, stated on 30 August 1973 that his Government had no power to stop  Mr Alexander  Barton from leaving Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that no request was received by the Australian Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to prevent the departure of this man, and certainly no request was received from the Government of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example the Departments of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Repatriation and Social Security each give assistance in restricted, or largely restricted ways, which deprive the great bulk of the community from the benefit of such services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was an earlier time when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  said that the Government had proposed certain accommodations in relation to these clauses - that it had retreated a certain amount but that it would retreat no further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knows very well that we have supported and had supported for a long while a bipartisan <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also knows very well that he is one of the architects of a destruction of a bipartisan <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which is certainly not supported by all members on the Government side of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  interrupted the Budget debate the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Coates),  in the first Budget speech he has made in this House, said some things with which I find myself in agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accused the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson),  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  and me of having abandoned our electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This policy was widely canvassed by my neighbour the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, a rural spokesman in this House representing the vast meat producing electorate of Riverina, announced that this levy on beef export products would not be lc per lb as stated in the Budget but had been increased to 1.6c per ,b, a rise of 60 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what has the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  done less than  2i  weeks after that announcement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, because he jumps side to side, from the back to the front or any way at all over fences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He makes numerous statements and now nobody seems to know what is the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government considered that with the changing pattern of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Australia and the Government’s own initiatives in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy giving priority to family reunion and sponsored’ migration it should attain self-sufficiency in respect of movement of migrants and that it was no longer appropriate for Australia to remain a member of ICEM. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>&lt;3) The decision was taken after consultation between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730912_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have already had some discussions through the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council with  Mr L.  J. Mooney who is the  President  of the Australian Council of Local Government Association and through him and with his co-operation the Association is at the present time carrying out a survey of all local government bodies with a view to ascertaining what their needs are, what their desires are and how we can help in the supply of migrants or, if you like, the diversion of settlers from these inner city areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  were the greatest pretenders of all great pretenders - no more, no less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know where the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was during the Budget discussions - he must have been representing the electorate of Riverina by hiding behind the door somewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730917_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to the statement made at the annual meeting of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd on 1,1 September by the company’s  chairman, Sir Ian  McLennan in which he said that the Federal Government had decided to allow BHP to resume its overseas recruiting campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister to a statement which he made on 22 May in which he said that the needs that had been put forward by such companies as BHP had been referred for consideration as part of the recommendations being formulated by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council on the level of intake for next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council I took the view that it would be desirable for these major corporations to put together their views, to indicate the sort of people that they wanted, where they thought these people would be available, where they thought these people should come from or should be available and the sorts of conditions that they were offering not only in terms of wages but also in terms of their accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am still awaiting from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council the details of the general picture from the spread of corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who is representing the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  in this chamber, has been gagged by the  Deputy  Government Whip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the amendment which we have just discussed has been in part covered by the answer given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without labouring the point that speech is almost an exact replica of the words which were used by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when introducing the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My main reason in rising to participate in this Committee debate is to express my concern at the deliberate attempts by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who is sitting at the table, to downgrade the responsibilities of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  several times tried to explain parts of the Budget Speech by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately in the second reading speech on this Bill the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who represents in this House the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt),  did not realise that the Prime Minister had had such a Press conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debate on the Budget, the kicking of the rural community at the hands of the Labor Party and by the honourable member for Riverina, the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who has completely welshed on those who elected him to this place, was stressed by member after member on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deplorable exercise of irresponsibility demon strated in this place a few seconds ago by a man who is currently the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, a man who has failed in his responsibilities to his electors demonstrably through the Bill that is before us, through the Budget and the neglect of rural interests which that Budget represented, is one of the damnations that must apply to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - I am told that he is a current financial member of the Australian Journalists Association, a journalist of some sort presumably in the past - regards this exercise of irresponsibility on the part of one of his ministerial colleagues and how he regards this treatment of the Press, the giving to them of a statement which has not corresponded with the truth of the assertions of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government’s left hand - particularly the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, representing the Minister for Primary Industry in this House, belatedly it is true; and I really wonder whether he is not ashamed to do so, but then again perhaps he does not represent his electorate - catches up with what the right hand, the Prime Minister, is doing or saying, perhaps then the Parliament can be told. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a great concern the honourable member and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have for their primary producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, in his second reading speech, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> does not know it, but the practice in the Department of Primary Industry has been that only ordinary time for the inspectors and veterinarians employed by the Department are met by the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although southern Australia produces a large and increasing share of Australia’s total meat exports, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who comes from the south, probably does not even know that in northern Australia by far the largest percentage of the meat slaughtered goes for export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>very pleasing to see the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> sitting here on his behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his speech, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - a man who once had pretentions to be Minister for Primary Industry until he became apprehensive of where his policies or the policies of his colleague might lead him - made the point that he did not think the levy would be passed on to producers, with profit margins of 0.7c and l.’25c per lb and a levy, according to the Bill, of 1.6c per lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now come to the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  in which he stated in the first sentence: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not believe that it is really fair to criticise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is imprecise; it does not conform with the Treasurer’s Budget Speech or the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise on this occasion more in sorrow than in anger because I have an uneasy feeling that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  either wittingly or unwittingly has deceived the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To my surprise and to the surprise of all of us we heard the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who is Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt),  come into the House and say that the Government wanted an increase from lc per lb to 1.6c per lb in the levy on beef. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is straightforward, as stated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I believe that matter will be explained in full by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who is at present at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second reading speech the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  stated that the charge is being made to cover the cost of meat inspection, which has grown with the huge increase in meat exported from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will bet that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who is the honourable member for Riverina has received his share. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two possibilities: One is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Riverina, misled the House when he introduced the legislation, because the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said something which contradicts what the Minister said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No explanation is given to this Parliament - an explanation which does not He with the statements of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who is at the table and who irresponsibly represents his colleague in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With great respect,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I think’ that this is highly relevant to the Bill because we are told by this Government in the Budget Speech and by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that one thing is going to happen and then the Prime Minister in the same hour is saying something quite different to the Press and that is completely, categorically and irrefutably proved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has made one too many speeches outside the Parliament and has allowed the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to mislead the House or unwittingly show that he does not know what the situation is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should demand that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> give a categorical guarantee that there will not be amending legislation within a week to increase this tax, as some Government supporters want, to a punitive level of 12c per lb which is basically, as I understand it, the kind of tax recommended by Government members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices - a tax that would bring in something like $160m to $170m a year additional revenue to the Government and which, at the same time, they would hope would force down the price of meat and keep it off the export market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> representing the Minister for Primary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730918_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier I did not go into an exposition as to why we have moved it but, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has raised the matter, I had better explain the reasons for the amendment in more detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After listening to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  trying to answer some of the questions raised by the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  I am convinced that I am now more confused than ever I have been since the commencement of this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The eradication of disease is far more important than some of the matters that have been put by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>) &lt;3.1) - I have given the facts; I have given the assurances; I have given all the information that the Committee needs to make up its mind and on that basis I move that we vote on the measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the attitude of the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  and the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  and to criticise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  for his rather deliberate attempts to sabotage a great industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has been talking about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the explanation which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has just given lies the cause of my fundamental concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept that what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has been saying has been said in good faith, and I can assure him that it is no reflection on him personally that we are pressing for this amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this debate began I had considerable sympathy for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  because he would not be the first Minister who, acting for another Minister, has picked up a Bill with whose contents he was not fully au fait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as I say, everybody makes mistakes, and I think that If the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had admitted on this occasion that he had made a mistake we all would have thought more of him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would not pretend that he has any influence in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In offering friendly, fatherly advice to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I say that, if he would recognise, firstly that he made a mistake when he introduced the Bill and, secondly, that the formation of a trust fund is the common way of ensuring that moneys are used for the purpose for which they are intended, we all would think more of him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause highlights the position which I put to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  previously in relation to my doubts about the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that it is almost, but not quite, in the nature of a mortal blow to the honour.ab’e member for Riverina, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to find that I am losing the fatherly advice of the ‘modest member’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to take the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  up on one point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is not acceptable to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is particularly instructive to look at the situation in Leeton, which is in the electorate of Riverina so inadequately serviced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who is just leaving the chamber, spoke for 6 or 7 minutes and tried to justify his existence as the honourable member for Riverina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  to my way of thinking made a complete fool of himself this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will mean a total increase of 6.7c per gallon for many of the constituents whom the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730919_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No public announcement was made by either the Prime Minister or the Minister responsible - the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> can carelessly cast aside our membership of ICEM it is important to make clear that senior officials in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have recognised its importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Andy  Watson, the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, said this to Senate Estimates Committee B in November 1971: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise now the presence of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another First Assistant Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Dempsey,  had this to say to the same Committee in October 1970: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was stated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in reply to a question that I placed on the notice paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is now in the House, to indicate, firstly, the reasons why the House has not been informed of the decision to withdraw from ICEM, even though that decision was made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and himself as far back as 7 March this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, himself a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, was party to the continuing negotiations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not had any direct discussions with the Victorian Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or his officers since the meeting of the State Ministers some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH the State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will be meeting in Adelaide on 9 November and any of the matters that call for co-operation will be dealt with there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> inform the House what measures are being taken by the Government to overcome the drastic shortage of interpreters to assist migrants with little or no English in such matters as contracts, court cases and government welfare services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the year 2001 this figure will increase to 8.5 per cent of the population if account is taken of existing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> trends or 9.1 per cent if <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers referred specifically to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Repatriation Department and Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They may go to the Commonwealth Departments of Social Security, Labour, Repatriation and in some areas Aboriginal Affairs and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has refused to review the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in spite of the continued tightening of the labor market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised the question of interpreter services in State government administration and health and legal institutions with State ministers for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at a conference on 11 May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council has established a subcommittee to study the problem of interpreter services in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am, however, far from satisfied with the piecemeal manner in which social workers or welfare officers are subsidised within the range of the related subjects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, repatriation, social security and other social welfare needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can deny that there is a rump in the Australian Labor Party and one of them - the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Mr Grassby) - is sitting on the other side of the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill before the House seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act which was first put before the House in 1970, debated to the second reading stage in 1971, and became law in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who is at the table has detailed some of the action that the previous Government took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amendment was moved to the Bill by the then shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and present Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  but the only real sub stance to the Opposition’s case was that there was no provision in the Bill for capital expenditure in terms of the building of extra classrooms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should point out that at that time the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had this to say about the scheme: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we can assess whether the scheme has failed by having a closer look at the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, which was presented in this House just recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is sitting at the table, will agree with me when I say that that is a substantial endorsement of the policy of the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has pointed out, it is obvious that more needs to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in the reference by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to a survey of child migrant education in schools of high migrant density in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education Office in Victoria, the Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Commonwealth Department of Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this investigation, as the Minister has said, Cabinet has approved a joint submission by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Education to extend the child migration education program to include provision for supplementary accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children are raised in a non-English speaking environment and on reaching primary school arc unable to participate in school activities … On 11 January 1973 the Director-General of the Queensland Department of Education approached the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for funds to establish pre-school facilities for migrant children in existing centres in West End and Paddington in Brisbane. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister could tell us from his knowledge of Cabinet activities whether the application has been successful-  the State Department of Education has indicated they would like their original submission to the Department cf <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> reconsidered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in his second reading speech referred to one aspect of the problem; that is the urgent need to extend to the fullest possible extent the present system of teaching migrant children English as quickly as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The few criticisms which he made were directed in the form of questions to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Bill 197i gave evidence of general agreement with 2 assumptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we consider the problems that face us in the area of migrant education we cannot escape the conclusion that Australia’s post war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been irresponsibly administered in the area of migrant child education, in the area of migrant adult education, and in the area of migrant integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Country Party supports this <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Bill 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do hope that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who is now at the table and who represents a rural electorate with a large percentage of migrants enrolled at the schools in that area, will ensure that some of these classrooms will also be provided in rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For many years, Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was based on an incoherent system of establishing annual targets, some settlers having their full fare paid for them, and others coming here under their own steam and paying their full fare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Arthur Calwell when the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme was introduced in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Jay  referred to the problems of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble with Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy  is that it has never had one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere has this shown up better than in the recent statement from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Dr Forbes,  ‘ tossing a few random extra dollars to the Good Neighbour Councils here, pumping a little more into child migrant education there, setting up a few infactory language courses for new settlers, and grandly announcing a whole new approach to selection and counselling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice the statement is a perfect example of the twin theses which have always underlain Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main factors that certainly has contributed to the problem over the years has been the fact that the responsibility for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, rightly, has been that of the national Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, supplementary schemes have been operated by various States, but the main impact of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the growth pattern of this nation has been rightly the responsibility of, and has been conducted under the authority of, the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  said in his second reading speech on this Bill, these classrooms are required at some 420 schools that have been listed by the education authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These shortcomings of course were forecast by the spokesman for the then Opposition during the debate on the previous legislation - now the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  who was then shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - when he proposed just such an amendment during the original debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise also to support the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Bill 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the previous Liberal-Country Party Government introduced the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I draw to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  the fact that in many of the schools where these demountable buildings will be provided there is already a large number of demountable or temporary buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1971 the present Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  then shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, was very anxious on behalf of the Opposition, to see that this initiative was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member referred also to the report of the Queensland Task Force and specifically mentioned the application to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for pre-school or child care centre assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> there is not this kind of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, my own Department, is already providing special instruction to migrant children at pre-school age in the child care centres in migrant hostels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is also in touch with the Australian Pre-School Commission as part of our interest in ensuring that the needs of migrant children at pre-school age will be taken into account by that Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are just getting the kits prepared in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact my distinguished colleague who was the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> used to say this with great passion and sincerity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a way I suppose I am using the debate on this Bill as an opportunity to ask a question of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they in fact engage in activities here which bring them to the notice of Australian courts I will invoke the full powers that are vested in me, as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to see them on their way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it quite clear that as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I treated his case in no way different from anyone else’s case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  sent a telegram to his constituents indicating his weakness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is a member of Cabinet, revealed by that action his importance in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Minerals and Energy would listen to him only if he received a few hundred - perhaps a few thousand - telegrams from the constituents of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but would not listen to the Minister speaking alone and on his own account, I would like to know how many telegrams were sent out of the Minister’s office and paid for at Government expense in regard to this operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To put it bluntly, this whole tactic of scaremongering on irrigation supplies was used by the Minister, and supported in a most unscrupulous way by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, in an attempt to hide his real motive which was to support the blackmail tactics of the New South Wales trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  who is under attack, and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  who has just completed his speech, were the only Ministers in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Minister for Minerals and Energy has had to support him is this poor, pathetic member for Riverina, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly he would be equalled by the Acting Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  who recently sent a 600-word telegram to each of the 93 members of Caucus, but I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is still in the lead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> sent an explanation in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-5-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theoretically, a council will have to work in liaison with the Australian Department of Social Security or the State offices of it and up to 13 other Australian Government departments, such as Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney-Generals’, Capital Territory, Education, Environment and Conservation, Health, Housing, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Labour, Northern Territory, Repatriation, Tourism and Recreation and Urban and Regional Development; the State Government in its various departments concerned with welfare services; local governments - there are 900 of them; the Australian Council of Social Services and the State Council of Social Services; various planning boards in existence and to be set up; and local bodies and charities concerned with welfare services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most communities today, particularly in country areas, the departments operating in this field include the departments of Social Security, Labour - that is, commonwealth employment - <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Repatriation, Aboriginal Affairs and Tourism and Recreation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the purpose of officers of other departments such as the Departments of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Housing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  were present he probably would say: ‘Ah, you are going back on your word and what you said before’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I am aware of the success which these councils have had in facilitating the integration of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731009_reps_28_hor86/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have done as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is to authorise the suspension in a number of areas of the easy system of tourist visa issuing which was introduced a few months ago to facilitate the movement of people to Australia with the least possible formality and the least possible amount of bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731010_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am also disturbed by the recent revelation by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that a sum of $lm has been donated to the Liberal and Country Parties by foreign interests with a view to defeating the popularly elected Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government is involved through the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the adult education program at the Brunswick North Primary School. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Education is involved though in a capacity of giving advice to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in preparing learning and teaching materials, and it assists with teacher training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members wish to use their time in the debate on the Estimates to speak about this important matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> there is adequate time for discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by the Honourable A. J. Grassby, 11 October 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the former Minister for Education and Science and the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Dr Forbes,  setting about the establishment of a task force to inquire into the needs of migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I need only instance the migrant education program operated through the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the provision of $16m for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, many misleading statements have been made and our friend the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has certainly been well to the fore in this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what honourable members think about that but it appears to me that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> seem to be having most of the say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever something favourable is about to be announced, of course we read the country Press and see statements made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few weeks ago when the postal rates were adjusted, affecting chiefly country newspapers, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was very quick on the draw. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that on this occasion the first the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> knew about the alteration in postal rates affecting country newspapers was when the honourable member for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon)  presented the case in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was very quick to rush around and suggest that he had been doing a wonderful thing for the country newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all realise that the one-eyed Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> must be pretty quick on the draw to get the publicity that he requires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Caucus ‘rural rump’, headed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  overwhelmingly defeated Cabinet’s recommendation agreed to earlier this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This article, of course, did not mention the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who is controlling primary industry - the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Minister for Primary Industry, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, the Caucus, the rural rump, or even you,  Mr Speaker? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talking about credit - I will conclude on this point - the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been very vocal on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> informs me that he has no objection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-42-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the final report by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731016_reps_28_hor86/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications of these recommendations will be considered by the Migrant Education Committee of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council at its next meeting to be held early in October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731017_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to answer specifically the honourable member’s question, I do not think the organisation could be properly described as having the support of the Opposition, because my information is that in 1952 this gentleman was railing at the then administration and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for having the temerity to permit into Australia Catholics and Italians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a year or two ago - many members will remember this - the proposition of the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the present Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  to attempt to raise funds to buy a portion of the Simpson Desert. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These costs determined in Australia are heavily influenced by national policies pursued by governments - not only by this Government but also by previous governments - being such things as economic growth, full employment, the diversification of industry and the pursuance of a high scale of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from that, there is a radical departure from previous policies in that there is a reduction in the overall <span class="highlight">immigration</span> quota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731018_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  speaking earlier in this debate showed some fear, but he tried to cover that up by his expressions of some hope in the activities of the proposed commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and Labor’s Minister for electoral survival - the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  - have joined in the conspiracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allegation made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was disgraceful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The evidence of the Government’s panic is the campaign of fear and hysteria being drummed up by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has consistently misled the Australian public by claiming that there is no shortage of skilled labour as a result of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cutback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of that decision, for the first time since Federation and for the first time since the end of the Second World War when our great <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program commenced, the  President  directed and found it necessary to order formally that his decision be printed in several languages, because he thought it proper that everybody affected by that decision should be able to read it and understand it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I bring visitors to my room and show them the little 8 ft by 8 ft room that I used to share with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members can imagine what it is like being left in one small room with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who used to turn his radio on full blast, had an 1810 typewriter which he used and would have 3 Italian visitors from his electorate drinking wine while I was supposed to be preparing a speech for the next day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course throughout the 1930s the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Palestine was greatly increased through the Nazi terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The temporary Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will not be here for very long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731024_reps_28_hor86/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether I favour the publication of awards and other information in various languages because it could have the tendency to create a multi-lingual community which, of course, is not what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and I wish to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I am impressed by the reply given yesterday by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to a question asked of him by my colleague the honourable member for Phillip in which he asked the Minister to consider issuing this information in various languages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to whom I have already spoken about this matter, the practice adopted in those countries which requires that each employer who enlists or recruits migrant labour shall be obligated to provide 300 hours in working time to study the Swedish, Norwegian or Finnish language or whatever the language happens to be in the particular country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I would go so far as to say that had the suggestion of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been adhered to before the strike reached the crisis stage that dispute may never in fact have occurred at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the numbers involved are no threat to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> says that the Government now pays their air fares; that is splendid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the presence in Saigon of a young couple by the name of Robertson, who carried the forms from official to official in our Embassy  -  I might say to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  that these officers have been very helpful - and through the bureaucracies in South Vietnam enabled them to cut off the last 2 months and, indeed, if this process were begun very much earlier I think there would be greater joy all round. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward to hearing something on this matter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me take the deceitful boast of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who is now at the table may not know that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> prepared to go along with the permission which the Minister who was at the table a moment ago granted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will come to order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is listening because, after all, he tried to make some capital out of this also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> referred to sales to China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is smiling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This raises a question so often raised by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not State quotas then why is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> so vocal about this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> knows very little about this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did not say: ‘The Government will give it to you’, but his statements were so worded that every grower looked at them and said: ‘Yes, that is what the Minister means’ or ‘That is what the honourable member for Riverina means.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the low rate of interest that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> promised us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  in his second reading speech, said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when one reads and hears some of the comments of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  I wonder just how little he knows about such problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes I wonder whether the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has even heard of the word weevil’, quite apart from having seen one or knowing what it does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy in Vienna have given all possible assistance to  Mrs Weber  in the presentation of her case to the Austrian courts to endeavour to have her son returned to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr 3  per cent at the table, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, says that it was not available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not shown these figures to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is at the table, but I have shown them to the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  who has approved of their incorporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Member for Riverina, Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  has obtained a firm assurance from the Treasurer,  Mr Frank  Crean, that the fruit industry will receive the full benefit of the money saved following the dropping, of the concession on carbonated drinks, which include some fruit product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  likes to deny that, I will be pleased to hear him say that this is adequate compensation for the fruit growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have listened to the speeches of members from Tasmania and to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and I wonder why they are not supporting this amendment because what it seeks is to take the whole issue out of the region of vague promises and to get it written in black and white. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731106_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mir GRASSBY (Riverina- Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>) (4.34) - There must be a sense of dismay in the community at large when it becomes known that the Opposition has decided to stonewall on this measure which is designed to give Australians some protection from monopolies and from exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he indicate on 30 January 1973 that there can be staff savings in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to ease the growth in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period January-June 1973 the employment situation improved to such an extent that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for 1973-74 was established at the same level as for 1972-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What action has the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> taken to remedy the widespread deficiencies in existing provisions in interpreting and translation facilities in the community revealed by the departmental survey of interpreting and translation needs in the community which he tabled, I believe, on 10 October? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intend to refer the matter of orientation courses, their content and the length of time they should occupy, to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  will regret the rather extravagant observations he has made concerning one or two honourable gentlemen on this side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that one of my friends happens to be wearing a rose - it has been described by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as a royalist rose - I do not think would sear the feelings of the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  in the least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply observe to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that on some occasions I fear for his safety because I am sure that he could be imprisoned in a bowerbird’s playground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>) - I wish to make a personal explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would assess - certainly it is the emphasis given by the Settlement Division of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - that a man ceases to be a migrant when he becomes a citizen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They should be given assisted passages under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would be led to believe by the remarks of the honourable member for Isaacs that the cause of all the problems of the building industry should be laid at the feet of this Government and its policies, including the responsible attitude that it has taken to the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme which a former Labor Government introduced in the early years after World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731112_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  stomped around the countryside promising loans totalling $50m at 3 per cent interest to farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will take advantage of the next poll to show their disapproval of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to ask the honourable member for Grey  (Mr Wallis)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  as well as the other honourable members opposite who represent country electorates, why they, together with the honourable members of the 2 Parties on this side of the chamber who represent rural seats, are not at least voicing their objection to the increased charges that are being levied in almost every way on the communications structure of people who live in outlying areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was members of the Country Party and some of our colleagues in the Liberal Party, headed by the honourable mem-., ber for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon),  who secured it, although the first man to rush outside and claim credit for it was the honourable member for Riverina, who is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731113_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Housing has a reputation for seeking headlines only surpassed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731114_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is totally and completely nondiscriminatory and based, in fact, on the assessment of individuals and not on their racial background, the pigmentation of their skin or their religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we evidently cannot trust the one on the Opposition side responsible for making arrangements concerning the business of the House, or the people behind him, so that there will be no doubt whatever in future as to what the arrangements are and so that honourable members opposite will be fully advised, let me inform them that in one hour from now the debate on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will be finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to direct my remarks to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and to express a point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The officers to whom I spoke conformed to the pattern that I have come to expect from officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In speaking to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I wish to bring a few matters to the notice of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their beneficial effect to our style of living since the commencement of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in 1949 is well known to all of us and is welcomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the total reach of the new policies and programs already undertaken, and others in process of preparation and introduction which have occupied the Government of which I am a supporter, none has more incisively and imaginatively gripped the mood and temper of the nation than has the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his statement to the House, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  revealed his remarkable capabilities and the informed concern with which he deals with the many facets of the subject under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would seem to me that there are 3 possible reasons to support a program of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I could return for a moment to the third of the reasons I advanced for support of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, it would seem to me that it is the only moral and valid reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting also to look at the dissection of the figures in regard to this Department, with particular attention to amounts of money being spent in the various fields and facets of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are 2 important aspects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> sector and it is pleasing to see increases there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures are alarming as I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  would agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures must give rise to alarm about Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy must also, of course, take into account our capacity to pro vide employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another important aspect of a successful <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s policy is for an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake in 1973-74 of 110,000 migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this program was started by the Liberal-Country Party Government and the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is carrying it through to its finalisiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should give us some valuable information and assistance with regard to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy at this point of time should be stepped up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested in some quarters that the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> might be reduced, that the expenditure should be down as the intake is down and that somehow Parkinson’s law should apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Parkinson  does not work in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates under consideration are not merely those of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because our Department covers not only <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but also emigration, settlement and welfare, citizenship and population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that year Arthur Calwell, who was then the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, announced the establishment of a concerted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy on the basis that increased population was essential to the growth and full development of the Australian economy in the post-war period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the fundamental principles underlying the continuance of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was the great economic and social benefit that flowed as a result of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731121_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent months a number of rackets have been uncovered by the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which have involved bringing people to this country in circumstances which are clear exploitation of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recall my question of 30 May last and my suggestion that Commonwealth instrumentalities such as the PostmasterGeneral’s Department and the Defence Department should set an example in teaching English to migrant employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will help them with the teachers and with the material, but at least the time should be made available in the workshops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They and the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  leave a number of vital questions unanswered, questions which should be answered by the Minister before these Bills pass through this chamber and questions to which the growers of the wheat are entitled to have answers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would almost have thought that the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  on this Bill had not been considered by the Opposition because, ironically enough, the Minister referred to the actions in 1968 of the present Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  as the then Minister for Primary Industry in drawing attention to the amount of money that had been contributed by the taxpayers under the terms of the Government’s guarantee for stabilisation purposes in the period up to 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the great <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake, the great bulk of those immigrants went to the over-centralised cities of Sydney and Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The placement of migrants in this country is “within the role of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody can say that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is not a fast talker when he is desperate; but it was not quite good enough tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to reply to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who, I am sad to say, is not with us at the moment; I doubt whether he was with us before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> affords himself an enormous task in trying to go out and defend the Government’s policies and attitudes towards the rural areas of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course no government can claim - nor can the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Riverina claim - that this has been a result of Labor policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it because the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  who is now the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, waxed so eloquent on the subject of the wine excise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should tell his constituents that the 1973-74 Budget will take $20m in a full year out of that industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to that statement, current staff is about 1,100 persons, of whom about 900 are locally engaged and about 350 are engaged in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly I question the need for maintenance of the 350 persons engaged in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731126_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was interesting to note that the Migrant Task Force for Victoria, established by the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  gave emphasis in its report to the fact that no more than 20 per cent of nonEnglish speaking migrant children in Melbourne were receiving the special sort of language assistance that they needed if they were to take proper advantage of the educational opportunities available to them or, failing taking proper advantage of those opportunities, merely functioned on an even level with the children around them who had no language disability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether interest in migration to Australia is rising rapidly in South American nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser,  labour and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> spokesman, said he generally supported the plan by the Labour Minisster,  Mr Cameron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MIGRANT EDUCATION  Mr BIRRELL-  Can the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> confirm that the Melbourne education task force has advised him that only 20 per cent of Melbourne’s non-English speaking migrant children are receiving adequate educational opportunities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the meeting of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Ministers in Adelaide just recently, it was unanimously accepted that a new thrust and a new effort would have to be made to correct some of the serious deficiencies in migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the honourable gentleman for his gracious welcome to me and to my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when we visited Ballarat yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member has asked whether we can do something about recording the history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> properly in an authoritative volume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to say that within the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, thoughts that have been nurtured for some time have come to fruition in the History Section, which is at present engaged in gathering material together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am at present considering a submission that would enable the commissioning of a history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A list of 47 academics, authors and writers has been compiled and I hope that from that list a selection can be made to commission a history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Are reports true that island girls are being brought into Australia as cheap domestic labour? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who is at the moment handling the Bill in this House looks through the departmental files he will find representations from me in respect to those products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know what the honourable member may or may not have said to his growers prior to the last election but certainly many people, including the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  I believe would have made some rather strange remarks prior to the last election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is proposed to move this amendment in the Senate the Opposition is quite prepared in the meantime before this legislation goes to the Senate to agree to withdrawing the motion for the deletion of sub-clause (3) if the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who is handling this Bill tonight, perhaps with the assistance of departmental officers, can show good reason why this sub-clause is necessary for the administration of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he discuss this matter with his colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and point out that the most favourable place for a migrant girl to become proficient in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did see some reference in the Press only a few days ago to this question, and a question was asked of my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the other day about the illegal importation of cheap coloured labour to be employed as cheap house help in wealthy people’s homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has given us the usual hysterical speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  both of whom are at the table, ought to be ashamed of themselves for advancing such weak arguments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said, the argument for a new national anthem has been discussed for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a little disappointed at some of the comments made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> says that there is not a great deal of interest shown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> says that it is too late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again say that it is not too late to do as the honourable member for Warringah suggests, and I am surprised at the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for talking such rubbish as to say that we should have woken up earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sorry indeed that the honourable Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is not in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It concerns the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> quite vitally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member has raised a serious question, because in the early days of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program there was no doubt that there was a considerable imbalance in the sexes, which led to a great deal of sterile competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Several weeks ago I asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question regarding a racket involving illegal migrants from Colombia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are members in the Australian Labor Party - the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  for example - who have in the horticultural industries in their electorates very real problems that just have to be faced up to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731212_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is aware of my repeated representations deploring the action of the Hungarian Government regarding two Australian citizens, Alfred and Anna  Gardos,  and their son and daughter, who are being held prisoner in Hungary following the confiscation of their Australian passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is likely that pasengers arriving at Tullamarine Airport on BOAC Flight 812A on 5 September may have taken up to two hours to complete customs and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> formalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a vital issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it is the case that the Prime Minister could not keep pace with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and his policy which changes almost daily, if not at least weekly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The records over a number of years show that one of the best Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that Australia has known was the late Arthur Calwell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government should not be proud of some of the policies laid down by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, like many of my colleagues, cannot understand why men like the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> can see what is going on and yet not have any influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where do the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the honourable member for Macarthur, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Northern Development stand on this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That man has evidently been listening to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because I can recall him as the honourable member for Riverina saying in this House when he was in Opposition that the primary producer never got anything from the subsidy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised that a candidate for an electoral seat could turn around and follow the line taken by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt he will hang himself if he follows the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on matters of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740307_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the betrayals of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  over rural finance, as bad as they are, pale into insignificance beside this action on superphosphate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least not many people took the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> very seriously when he talked about $500m for farmers at 3 per cent apart from the people of the Riverina, who believed the Minister, much to their cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who used to come in here caterwauling week after week last year and who went out at election time making promises a mile long and who has delivered nothing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the reputation in this House of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  is one that could be based on reticence, but where is he today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have also mentioned the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not had the grace to acknowledge that he has ministerial commitments and is presid ing over the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council meeting in Melbourne this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The headings of discussion in the Conference were: The Enlarged European Community and the Commonwealth’, ‘World Security’, ‘The Future of Territories in the Commonwealth’, ‘Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies’, ‘Parliamentary Government (in its various aspects)’, and ‘Economic Problems and Social Problems’, the last two being taken in committee session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the delegation did take part in debate on the European Economic Community, World Security, the Protection of the Environment, Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and the Status and Role of the Parliamentarian in contemporary society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was that incredible contretemps between the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said: ‘I will ask the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council if I can bring in 20,000 more migrants’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been a double failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has gone over to Ireland and Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has adopted a new attitude towards <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter I wish to raise tonight in the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House concerns the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to see that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is in the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The folk concerned have written to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but have received no reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I advised the person concerned that the telegram from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had been received and that I would notify her as soon as I had received further information from the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following this, I made further representations to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 15 February pointing out that I had received a further representation and stating that I would appreciate the Minister looking into the matter as it was now a matter of some urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 22 February I received in a reply a telegram from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From 22 October when my first letter was sent to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and I first made representations in this regard - I say nothing about the original letter written by this lady in September because, as I said earlier, it was written to my State colleague who forwarded it on to me in October - to this day, no final decision has been made on this matter and I believe that nobody would dispute my statement when I said that there was something wrong with the administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal has been spoken about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and about all the various factors relating to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, yet here is a case which I think is - I use the word sincerely - a disgrace to the ‘Department, that over a period of time the Department cannot give a reply to a member making representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet on exactly the same day I received a telegram from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> informing me that the person concerned had been interviewed in the country where the application originally had been made and that it was hoped that very soon that person would be given permission to enter Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, frankly, I think that this case, plus the other cases to which I have referred show a need for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to pay a little more attention to what is happening in Sydney than travelling around overseas telling everybody what a marvellous Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Government we have and what can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I informed the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that I intended to raise this matter this evening because I think that the length of time it has taken is beyond all bounds of reasonableness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always taken the view that when an application is made to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> confidentiality should prevail between the applicant and the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The availability of tradesmen under the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is a diminishing factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we have seen a discontinuance, largely, of the past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs which have provided many of the skilled workers who contribute in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has nothing to apologise for in its current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave - I take this opportunity to make comment not only about the particular matter that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has mentioned but also about other aspects of his <span class="highlight">immigration</span> administration for the simple reason that the Minister has resolutely, over a long period, not encouraged, not enabled and not taken any measures in this House to permit a proper debate of the alleged <span class="highlight">immigration</span> changes he has made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is another area in which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in particular are culpable in relation to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in a way in which no similar charge can be laid against any other Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or any other Prime Minister since the days of Arthur Calwell, the first and possibly the greatest Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whom Australia has had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that his tradition in helping to establish a bi-partisan approach to this matter could not have been continued because it was Arthur Calwell - it was probably only a member of the Labor Party who could do it - who gained trade union support for a large and continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, partly from grandstanding and partly from belief and a search for publicity that general trade union support for a continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program looks like being threatened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being threatened because the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are more concerned with publicity and are more concerned with immediate happenings than with the long term and solid development of Australia on a basis that does not arouse concern and passion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will presumably be dashing those expectations in the same way as he has in relation to the Fijians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point in this proposal is that it runs the risk, as has become most evident in the last few days, of jeopardising continuing trade union support for a substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that Australia needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a situation that would seriously jeopardise the continuing support of the trade unions for an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and particularly the Prime Minister are culpable for having established the circumstances in which aspirations which will not be fulfilled have been aroused in the Philippines and in which fears have been aroused in the trade union movement for the first time since Arthur Calwell, to his continuing and lasting credit, sold an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to the trade union movement of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to Fiji, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has ignored the experience and the advice of officers of his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By making that statement he aroused expectations that cannot and will not be fulfilled even by the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is concerned with headlines and not with the substance of policy in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is interested in the froth and not the responsibility of administering <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An example perhaps of the understandable but overdeveloped wish for publicity of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> can be seen from a news release issued by the Minister - I understand it was written by him - when he described the welcome given to him in Calabria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He would do much better to look to his responsibilities to the Australian Parliament and people and to the administration of his Department rather than perpetually to seek flamboyance and headlines which will damage the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What this Parliament needs - I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to produce it - is a clear statement of the Government’s policy and of the changes of emphasis that have been introduced and of the new policy initiatives which he alleges he has introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicate the importance of this matter because many of the policy initiatives which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> claims to have introduced in relation to the welfare of migrants in Australia were policy initiatives formerly announced by my colleagues the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  or the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the contempt with which he treats the Parliament in relation to major statements of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, of which there is none that I can recall in this Parliament, and the contempt which he has so far shown for the Notice Paper by failing to answer questions, will not be continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him to make a statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and to allow it to be properly debated - not by one or two speakers a side but properly debated - in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the powers of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are great enough for him to persuade the Leader of the House that this matter is worthy of debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been going around saying one thing today and another thing tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the statement which has been made today by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> certainly will not help our relations with those countries, particularly with Fiji. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable member for Wannon that there is an urgent need for re-examination of the total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that it highlights the confusion and doubt about the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the present Government under the administration of the present Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of his speech a few moments ago the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said that I would not allow a debate on the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member for Wannon wishes to discuss <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, I invite him to get up and put up or shut up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  has said that there will be full opportunity for any member of this Parliament, especially myself and the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock),  to speak about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  Her  Majesty the Queen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the same as a specific debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>) -  Mr Speaker,  I seek leave to make a personal explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wannon - a former Minister - suggested and stated during the course of his remarks that I had made no statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has stated is correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he sought to make a statement in this House on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on a previous occasion leave was denied to him to do so and he had no alternative but to present a paper without comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier today the Leader of the House and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> claimed that the Government had been refused leave to make a statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pages 1979 and onwards of Hansard of October last year indicate that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> sought leave to make a short statement, but to have incorporated in Hansard - a quite unusual procedure - the body of his statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have made the point that I wanted to, and that is that the Leader of the House and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had indicated that there was an opportunity for a debate in the last session of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was not, and the words of the Leader of the House as reported in Hansard confirm that no opportunity was provided for a debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat the challenge to the Government: Any time it wants to debate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> it will be debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First I want to say to the honourable member and the House that the parents have been in touch with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and have received a reply from the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740314_reps_28_hor88/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The direct cost to the farming community of his proposal would be $28m a year, compared with the cost of taking away the superphosphate bounty of S50m, less the tax deduction, which I have been led to understand by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  would produce a net cost of about S30m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  was sitting in the House until a few moments ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that the Minister is just as mixed up in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we have seen the amiable colourful Minister when on his overseas tours successfully confuse the Australian people, our Asian friends, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the ACTU, as well as his own Prime Minister and Government on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for Labor’s ambivalent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting thing is that as a result of the procedures which were then in force and which are now in force in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, some 7,000 to 8,000 people were regularised by being encouraged to apply properly and return or by having their status regularised here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject I have raised this afternoon needs a good deal more light and a good deal more information than the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  so far has been prepared to make available inside this Parliament or outside it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if anyone searches through those statements for matters of real substance and matters that have come to cause concern to a large number of people in the Australian trade union movement and in the general Australian community, he will not find much enlightenment or much help from this Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is probably the most publicised Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that we have had and I would think almost certainly the most publicised of the present Ministers of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs a dose of open government because for the last IS months it has had a good solid dose of closed, secretive government and of refusal to supply answers and facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrant counselling was greatly expanded under decisions announced by the honourable member for Barker when he was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question concerns details of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - it is question number 999  -  such as the number of people coming to Australia and the number of assisted migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Hansard record would show that the total debate for the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> lasted about 2 minutes less than one hour, and that does not comprise a proper debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 14 March this year the Leader of the House made it quite plain that debate was not to be allowed on this issue and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was asked if he would make a statement on details giving the direction, the purposes and the consequences of Labor policy in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would you please give me a set of the principal policy statements that you have made as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I suppose he felt that was appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it does not come to the substance, the purpose and the direction of Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth was ‘Australian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Statistics - March 1973’  -  he said that these were the latest available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The direction, purpose and consequence of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program depend upon the numbers of people who are coming to Australia and the countries from which those people come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the kind of thing that is to result from the Minister’s handling of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> portfolio it certainly is not going to result in great advantage to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the Minister jeopardising union support for a continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, which only the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would be capable of doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been the trend in South East Asian countries in inquiries and applications since the Government announced its new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, what weight does the Minister place on advice from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those discussions I was accompanied by the Permanent Head of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr R.  E. Armstrong, who was indeed one of the founders of that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is allegation our citizens have offended against <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council, the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and the other organs of advice which were established, incidentally, by the previous Government and which we have continued have continued to provide that advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council met today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What used to happen - this has happened and is on file - is that one brother would apply for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have personally vetted 62 applications for citizenship, have had them re-investigated and have granted citizenship since I became the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions have also been made that Australia has built up bad relations in our neighbourhood because of its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has done irreparable harm not only to Australia, but to all European nations with interests in Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who will speak later in this debate, has the responsibility of advising me, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, on Australia’s absorptive capacity in relation to the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the honourable member for Wannon concluded by saying that the purpose of raising this matter today was to get some clear information flowing from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the view of my colleague on this side that the administration and the equivocation of the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has caused confusion both here and elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the man who was taking the keenest interest in what was being said by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  was the man who wrote the policy of the Australian Labor Party on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and was refused the right to administer it, the man who was stripped of his position as spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and refused permission on the Opposition side of the House to enunciate his views until the then Government gave him the right to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s not easy to reconcile the announcement that Australia has dropped its racially discriminatory <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy with what few facts are available about the results of Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Edwards goes on to quote the words of a very distinguished diplomat who seems to take a different view from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the occasion of a fracturing or a likely fracturing of Australia’s foreign relations caused by the manner in which this Government is pursuing its immigation program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The column quoted a cable dated 22 February 1974 from the Australian Ambassador in the Philippines,  Mr Henderson,  to the Department of Foreign Affairs and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a matter of some urgency and of real importance in terms of Australia’s relations generally with the Philippines that Australian administrative procedures of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> be brought into line with the principles enunciated by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the friendly relations enunciated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>isn’t it odd that the Australian Ambassador on the spot, presumably advised by his Second Secretary who handles <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, should have misunderstood so seriously what happens inside his own embassy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some allegations also have been made about the manner in which the previous Government conducted its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a debate brought about by the failure of the Government to produce a coherent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I enter the debate to plead with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to inform adequately this Parliament and the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House, in the traditions under which migration has been debated in this Parliament for many years have no desire to spread denigration in this most sensitive arena and I will firmly resist any moves to foster debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> along selfish, arrogant, intolerant or divisive lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the Prime Minister’s recent Asian trip, he assured the Philippines Government that Australia no longer had an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which discriminated on the basis of colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister was reported as telling  President  Marcos that no longer would double standards be applied to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 15 March 1974, following discussions between the Prime Minister and the Ministers for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions executive, who themselves could get no coherence and, certainly until then, no consultation, the Government announced the shelving of the Leyland plan to bring in 35 semi-skilled Filipino workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following a meeting between the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and my good self, together “with the executive officers of the Australian Council of <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point is the failure of the Government to inform the House adequately of changes in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my political career, no Minister has used more words, made more Press statements, had more publicity - I do not blame the Press for this because we know he is a very colourful character - confused more people, indeed divided more people and changed the policy more frequently than the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that maybe he would not be in this position today if he had a Press secretary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  said last night: ‘If she’s still as nice as she was when we deported her when she was five, I’ll be delighted to welcome her back.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and some of his colleagues can answer some of the questions which these headlines raise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘Australian Financial Review’ of 20 February 1974 had this headline ‘“Social” <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for a balanced Australian society’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A headline in the National Times’ of 20 August 1973 reads: If White Australia is dead <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> isn’t saying’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has plenty to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it is ALP policy to have a non-discriminatory <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think earlier this afternoon the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  in his remarks referred to the Minister for Services and Property because he had a very definite policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said in this House 2 weeks ago, he would be classified as one of the most successful Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, whereas the opposite applies to the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I say to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: On these issues the best way to fight fire is to prevent it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introductory remarks which were made this afternoon by the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and his colleague the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  made it clear to me and I am sure to most thinking Australians that if both of these gentlemen were entrusted with  thz  responsibility of writing an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for the Liberal Party, each of them would produce a vastly different policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without seeking to embarrass the honourable member for Kooyong, I must say 1 am sure that his genuine ideas on non-discrimination would be much closer to the Australian Labor Party’s policy than would the attitude and policies of the present Liberal Party spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the honourable member for Wannon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is 200 years out of date, because the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has reminded me that there were more than 12 different nationalities in the First Fleet that came to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite clearly to the Opposition that it is entirely dishonest to claim that this Government has failed to inform the House adequately of changes in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has received the attention of honourable members opposite ever since we came into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will say quite clearly today that the recent announcements by the Prime Minister in the Philippines and the recent decisions by the Minister for Labour and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to initiate conferences with the Australian Council of Trade Unions in order to discuss the qualifications of overseas tradesmen are progressive steps on which those Ministers should be congratulated, and it should not be suggested that suddenly, overnight, new Labor Party policies have been devised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over a period of some years before our success in 1972, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in Australia had fallen into a state where successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> applied their own policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a period of 23 years the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government had control of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The triumphant visit abroad by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> shortly after Labor came into office, followed more recently by the Prime Minister’s trip abroad, did much to elevate Australia in the eyes of the Asiatic countries close to our borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, in particular, are to be congratulated not only by this nation but also by every decent, fair-minded human being because at last a credible and honest image has been established for Australia, particularly in the eyes of the Asiatic section of the world in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the previous Government showed clearly that it did have such a policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The confusion in this respect is similar to the confused situation which reigns in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at the present time in that the Minister for Labour appears to be adopting a different line from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740321_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives rise to my first query of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who is at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it very clear that the Opposition has supported the Bill before the House but 1 think for the record and in fairness to all concerned I have to reply to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who was very critical of the former Liberal-Country Party Government for, as he wants to convey it, having allowed the wool market to fall to such an extent that wool sold at 30c or 37c per lb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is sitting at the table, would not want to take the blame for the current fall in wool prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr GRASSBY (Riverina- Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>) - I wish to make a personal explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of the fact that various pastoral finance companies and houses are finding more money for loan funds in this industry, and of course others, I thought it only right, in view of the incredible remarks of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  a moment ago, to remind him again - it must be 3 months since I have - that it was his promise during the last election campaign to make $500m available at, from memory, 3 per cent per annum interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the financial implication that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should wake up to, even if he cannot see it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just a few minutes ago he made the statement by implication that the primary producers are better off because he is sitting there as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the $45.4m now sought for capital works and services, the major requirements are $2m for emergency classroom accommodation for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>; $l.lm for the purchase of residential properties at overseas posts; $33m for the Postmaster-General’s Department to meet the cost of new wage rates and improved conditions of service together with’ increases in the prices of materials; $7.2m for the Department of Services and Property, of which $1.7m is for acquisitions of freehold properties in the Australian Capital Territory and $4.1m for acquisition of properties for overseas posts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has made a number of statements both in this Parliament and outside it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen quite plainly that actions of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and actions of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  have aroused in a number of countries expectations which it is most unlikely will be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members are aware that hundreds of applications a day have been made in the Philippines as a result of the visits made there by the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his speech the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> read out from a table figures indicating increased numbers of people who have come to Australia from other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister has forgotten when there was a debate in the Parliament on those matters concerned with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> his memory is even more defective than I would have believed it to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been far better if the Minister had been content to be a more silent Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and not arouse expectations which he, or the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  at any rate, certainly would not want to see fulfilled and would not be able to fulfil without introducing changes which I doubt that the Leader of the House would be willing to see introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using parliamentary privilege <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Minister Grassy recently made serious unfounded and insulting allegations against me in Federal Parliament Canberra on question of twelve Fijians recently deported from Australia and matters related thereto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apisai  Tora Shadow Minister Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Fiji <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not only in this area but, I have been informed, in other areas also that the Minister has been inclined to make statements announcing policies and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers overseas have not known anything about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no field within which there is a greater necessity for an explanation of where this country is heading more than <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is confusion as to just what is meant by Australia’s current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and whether there is still an opportunity for persons in Asia to come to Australia and on what terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the application of the easy visa system, as referred to in the statement of the  Minister  for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  suggests that a visitor will not be able to alter his status while in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing I want to say about present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is that it is regrettable that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  suffers from verbal diarrhoea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In confusing the understanding of the Australian electorate and people abroad on the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy he performs equally admirably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that neither the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> nor the AttorneyGeneral should continue such pursuits in their vendetta against those who they say are breaching Australian laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I believe that at this stage there is a real necessity for Australia to embark on a concerted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has seen fit to make this statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from that, of course, it is represented by my dear friend and colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  a very sober, quietly dressed young man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  is not here tonight to hear what I have to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not mention tonight the $500m at 3 per cent which was the alleged promise - I will be careful - of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  prior to the last election because I want to go one stage further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Mr Cross continuing to address his question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>)- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> administration under the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has been a failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a nation we are now confronted with massive inflation and severe economic instability, the highest interest rates since federation, excessive increases in direct and indirect taxation, a crisis in the housing industry unparalleled since the immediate postwar period, record levels of industrial unrest, a severely reduced defence capability, a massive erosion of the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners, uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries, an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which has heaped confusion upon confusion and a breakdown in communication between the Government and the major constituent groups in the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not really think that the honourable member for Riverina, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, was so sensitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who incidentally is out of his seat, may be more familiar with dictatorships than I am because he is a member of a Government which is seeking to run this House like a dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Minister is a temporary bird of passage in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to drawn to the attention of the House tonight, particularly to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  whom I thank for coming into the chamber, a matter concerning Fijians in Brisbane last weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was referring to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of past years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall summarise some of his claims, bring them to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and ask him to give me and the House tonight the facts of this incident that took place in Brisbane last weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>729 which the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  is most anxious that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> computer records indicate that perhaps 960 or 1,000 people - that is all - came into Australia under that system, not 30,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I further call upon the Opposition in this Parliament and particularly the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  who at one time was the minister of State for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to tell us in this Parliament what their reaction is to the advice that has been given to this Government, to the national Parliament and to the nation by the Queensland Minister for Justice,  Mr Knox  - that we should return to the past, that we should discriminate, that we should repeal all the things that have been done to abolish discrimination and put it all back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has blocked our policies on housing, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and many other subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have added in representations of my own that we urgently require a Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> representative in this electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement was based on a report by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council which said, inter alia: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was he the author of the press release, issued on 5 February 1974, which stated that incredible scenes of hospitality and enthusiasm greeted the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  when he visited Calabria in Southern Italy on the second stage of his Italian tour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740410_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-41-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and I have had discussions on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the way I see it and that is the way the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> also sees it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman will be aware of the text of a letter sent by his colleague, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to the Treasurer, a copy of which was sent to the honourable gentleman’s office, wherein the Minister for Labor said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Is the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> right? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the honourable gentleman share his colleague’s view that the Government should change course along lines which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has publicly indicated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, is the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, by inference, publicly criticising his colleague the Federal Treasurer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> still say, as he did in his letter of 27 June, that the Government’s economic policies will cause unemployment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Overseas Trade - the  Deputy  Prime Minister - yet convinced the Prime Minister of the probability, if not the certainty, of unemployment as a result of Government policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is that the reason for the reintroduction of import licensing for certain industries as it was announced yesterday which was, I think, point 4 in the policy matters proposed by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in his letter which the Prime Minister claims to know nothing about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This inevitable consequence has been recognised by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and also by the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, in a letter to the Treasurer dated 27 June, copies of which were sent to all of his ministerial colleagues, said this: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sorry mess which was referred to during question time today and which was gratuitously referred to by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was an economy in which the worst level of unemployment was 2.4 per cent or almost 137,000 in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have used the argument elsewhere - I do not know exactly where it was - that you might imagine that you were in the seat adjoining the electorate of Hindmarsh, represented by that gentle, fragrant soul, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has his attention been drawn to reports today which suggest that the arrival of more than 130 Spanish migrants in Brisbane has given rise to fears by State Labor Party leaders and trade union leaders that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy will aggravate the local employment situation there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> make it available to the public? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that it can be known whether the copy of a letter which I hold in my hand is accurate and a correct fascimile of the letter from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, will the Treasurer undertake to table the letter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I receive a lot of letters from my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is supplementary to a question asked by the Leader of the Australian Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the breakdown of communication and infighting between Ministers over economic policy, evidenced by the Prime Minister’s ignorance of the letter from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the Treasurer and his refusal on two occasions to allow that letter to be tabled; (.1) the Prime Minister’s re-endorsement of an 8 per cent inflation target by mid-1975 in the face of contradictory statements by the Treasurer; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we come to that grey haired  old  mare, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who put in his 2 bits worth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is supposed to be the expert on this matter, was asked a question about the Prime Minister’s statement and he said: ‘I do not agree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of those obligations is to abide by the decrees of a court, as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said, as the Government has said, and as the Labor Party’s published policy documents show. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that my colleague, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has done the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is he aware of the growing number of unemployed in the country areas  of New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> must seek leave to make a statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> policy, particularly when it relates to migrants who want to enter the work force, must play an important part in the formulation of manpower policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will ensure that there is a much closer relationship between <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and manpower policies than there has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is so close to the labour movement, should do most to ensure that those bans are removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister refers to the advantages that will come through the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> being combined with the Department of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many problems of migrants which the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is illequipped to deal with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would have the sensitivity and the understanding to be aware of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons why we want the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to remain and maintain its separate identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are real problems which the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  will deal with for the Opposition parties, and they are not best dealt with by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  in moving the second reading of this Bill indicated that he thought that it was a simple measure and a purely procedural matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that this situation is one which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would have relished as a challenge to put the situation in Australia’s hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyway, my hope is that I can get some glimmer of intelligence from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in reply to the allegations that I am about to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740717_reps_29_hor89/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not lost over unionism or demarcation issues, as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  are so fond of saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall put this in terms which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> might understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, nor the Prime Minister, nor any other Minister is prepared to tackle the Builders Labourers Federation or John Halfpenny of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  lives in a fairy tale world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the record of the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Government stepped beyond the role of honest broker when the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> appeared on television last year to support a 35-hbur week for power workers in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to contrast that with the attitude that has been adopted by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is never difficult to defend him against attacks, puerile as they may be, from the Opposition, because his record in the short time that he has been Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this Parliament is, in my view, without parallel in the history of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have received an increase probably two or three times as much as the postal workers have claimed yet they stand here and criticise this Government and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  began his speech by suggesting that the measure he was introducing was a simple one, a technical machinery measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> himself is on record as having said that he is not in favour of 35-hour arrangements if all they mean is an increase in the number of hours worked at the overtime rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bringing about of a permanent scheme of employment for waterside workers is not a matter in relation to which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  or his advisers, or anybody else, say to those who work on the waterfront: ‘These are the conditions under which you will work’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that my colleague, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, is very anxious that many of the difficulties that have arisen in the past between various unions, because of the multiplicity of them, should be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> brings forward further proposals later this year many of the difficulties that have arisen in the past and could arise in the future will be resolved, simply because we will no longer have the ludicrous situation of one union arguing against another union in relation to work to be done, which is commonly known as a demarcation dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  explained in his second reading speech, the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Bill 1974 is designed to provide for an extension of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act for a period of 2 years pending the introduction of permanent legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  not tell us where he is running into all this trouble? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are working in close co-operation - perhaps that is too much to hope for from this Government - on the associated aspects of future port upgrading and labour relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> saying, as he did in a speech in June, that industrial conflict is a natural consequence of our economic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  knows, as we all know, that there is a sweetheart agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, we propose to reduce the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to existing commitments, we shall be aiming for a total intake of not more than 80,000, of which assisted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would be not more than 40,000 - that is, approximately 10,000 less than last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pulldevilpullbaker attitude of the various cliques and personalities - the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  the Treasurer, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Labor Caucus - have ensured that sound economic and financial policies by the Labor Government are impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister agree with the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point we have to ask is whether these dismissed workers will be relocated in Melbourne and Sydney under the manpower policy of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to which I referred earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> refers to the Darwin dump barge dispute which for months has been steadily strangling a dozen or more towns and settlements along the 800-mile Northern Territory coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be noted that the Press statement released at that time by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  had been written by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this situation we find the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Prime Minister and others willing to condemn air hostesses but not the AMWU and John Halfpenny and not the Builders Labourers Federation for what they might want to do in terms of guerrilla tactics and industrial anarchy right around Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has said that if the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were changed the situation would be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A few minutes ago the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  attempted to chastise - if I may use a kindly term - the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  for not talking about remedies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A while ago the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said that the honourable member for Wannon was all talk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  pointed out, we are living in a society in which there are labour markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initiatives that have been taken by the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are to be commended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We challenge honourable members opposite to put on the line what they would do - not merely voice criticism of the tremendous job being done by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740724_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware of the possible closure of Port Augusta as a shipping port as a result of the cessation of the shipment of Tennant Creek copper ore and concentrates through that port? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as Wangaratta is concerned, the Government recently formed a special task force, comprising representatives of the Department of Manufacturing Industry, the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Department of Urban and Regional Development and, I think, the Department of Overseas Trade, to go to Wangaratta and investigate the position on the spot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware of the figures of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which show the following percentage change in each quarter from January 1973 to December 1973: March 1973 quarter 2.2 per cent, June 1973 quarter 0.6 per cent, September 1973 quarter 1.5 per cent and the December 1973 quarter minus 0.7 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the program is introduced in part without the proposals that are intended to make it a more efficient and a well worth while operation then I think we will be making a big mistake because in the time I have been in this House - and it has only been short - matters relating to the Post Office, in common with social service and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters, have been the major matters of complaint that have come to me and that I have had to raise on behalf of my constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has been at the table in the chamber recently boasting of the increases in the work force, patting himself on the back for this and saying that so many of the additions to the work force are married women. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> gets up in this chamber and boasts that because of these economic stresses these women with young families have been forced to take employment which they would not take of their own choice, I find it, if I may say so, a little distasteful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  remains a point of conjecture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The confusion and uncertainty created by the Prime Minister’s actions in dismembering the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that one of the principal responsibilities of any national government is the framing and administration of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and its effects on a nation is not a short term phenomenon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies are irreversible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the effects of changing migration policies and administration are so far reaching, the Opposition believes that the Government owes to the people of Australia, both recent arrivals and those who could claim to be native sons, a clear and detailed explanation of the reasons behind the recent changes wrought in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possible effects of this inquiry’s recommendations in relation to future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and administration are obviously enormous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee was due to report to the Government this June, according to the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, when he spoke about it last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  are still battling for control of the population planning section of the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting aspect of this struggle is that both the Minister for the Environment and Conservation and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development are avowed supporters of zero population growth, whilst the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is responsible for manpower planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at another field of uncertainty and unease - the relationship between foreign affairs policy and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact of life that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies do have some bearing on these relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the split up of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> still leaves unclear the question of the issue of migrant visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the results of the Government’s emphasis on sponsored <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and family reunion are unclear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one would claim that the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and its officers were perfect, but also no one would deny that the officers of the Department exhibited experience, expertise and dedication of an extremely high order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To support this view I have no less an authority than the former shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, now the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who is sitting at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to quote what he said about the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 7 May 1968, in his former position as shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Commonwealth is extremely lucky to have a department like the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No other department in the Commonwealth acts so efficiently or with such great credit to its country as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> does. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were the words of the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council or the Good Neighbour Council not consulted about the decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have continually stated, both in writing and in speech, is that over the past 23 years Australia’s growth in population has been 1.9 per cent - that is, 1.1 per cent natural growth and 0.8 per- cent growth from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have advocated that we should work towards a 1 per cent increase in population which will include both <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and natural growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been given recently the position of shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and so he is determined to see that a job is created for him in the unlikely event of the Opposition Parties attaining government - I do not blame him for putting up these phoney arguments in respect of a department of which, one day, he hopes he will be the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Long before that unhappy day comes he will find that the present Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been so well integrated and will be working so well that to give him the portfolio that he is striving to obtain would be to create enormous chaos and impose upon the migrants unnecessary hardships and disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, I have heard of a huge and overwhelming reaction to the vicious comments made by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly suggest to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> not to set foot in that area for a long time to come, because he might come back- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table supplied by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> setting out productivity rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that he is not operating in the same Party as the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who is now the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole principle of the proposition of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> concerning indexation is to utilise the process of indexation as a substitute for the cost pressures of wages due and the subsequent effects on price rises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would fit in quite well with the current program of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, concerning his process of indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the spokesman still the Treasurer or is it even the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well, we had the extraordinary situation of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> writing to the Treasurer and arguing that the Government had to change course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has also been busy telling the Press and the Australian public that unemployment is going to rise and that he has felt that way for a long time now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, he forgot to tell the Prime Minister that, because at a Press conference on 2 July the Prime Minister, although he had spoken extensively to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the previous day, said he knew nothing of the Minister’s predictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that very same day the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was engaged in the favourite pastime of Labor Ministers of leaking - not just any information but the June rise in unemployment and a record fall in job vacancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has not yet been told to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the  Deputy  Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was the latter day Henry Georgist, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister’s own Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has argued against flat rate indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740730_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, my namesake here, would quickly talk to the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  or any other relevant Minister and say: ‘You are not going to do this because obviously there is a great degree of reluctance to accept it on the part of the people involved in this industry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone examining this Bill will not be helped very greatly by the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only degree of sincerity the honourable member for Wannon displayed was in the only real contribution he made to the debate, when he pointed out to the House - I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - that somebody somewhere made a typographical error. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the face of that, there is one thing that can be said for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and that is that at least he is a trier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder why when a debate of this kind is proceeding in the House on a Bill introduced at least for the third time by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the honourable gentleman is not in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has returned to the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether this is because it is thought that under the existing legislation amalgamation is too hard and whether those who might be parties to further amalgamations simply have been holding off in anticipation of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> eventually tiring out the Opposition and the Senate so that, at his fourth try, his legislation will be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed at the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  promoting the establishment of a monster which could become an embarrassment to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should enforce the principles of rank and file control of oganisations through the provision of a secret ballot under Commonwealth Electoral Office supervision for the election of the officials of all organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  I know, is concerned about union democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is it that is wrong with a secret ballot by postal votes that causes the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to delete those words from the Bill and use the word ‘ballot’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to make a final plea to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  because I really believe that this amendment strikes at everything the Minister believes is important for the rank and file members of the union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740731_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will be tabling today the report of  Mr Justice  J. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is just as well aware as I am that it threw union organisations into serious turmoil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  whether he could let the House know when legislation flowing from the report of  Mr Justice  Sweeney might be before the House because, as we heard earlier this morning, it is an important matter and one that has gone forward for a long while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  seeks to weaken the Commission’s capacity to protect that public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One aspect of it is the training of trade union officials, for which the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has carried the torch, as it were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an important step, an important part of a total program for which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is entitled to receive absolute credit and the praise of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard him answer a question from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who is at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to turn now to some of the things that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said in introducing this Bill on 25 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was about to deal with some of the remarks made by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when introducing the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister at the table, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, says that this is what this Bill is aiming to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an earlier speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 21 March 1974, when he introduced the same Bill into the House, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1961, a very considerable amount of work was done, first by  Sir Garfield  Barwick as AttorneyGeneral, and subsequently by the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when he was Attorney-General, on proposals for the establishment of a new court . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two days ago a matter of public importance on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was submitted for discussion by the Opposition, and there were not enough Opposition members in the House to keep the debate going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The thing which they said was urgent and in which one would have thought previous Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, including the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  would have some interest, lapsed because there were not enough of them in the House to support their proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I preface a question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> by saying that I have read with interest the proposals that he has persuaded the Government to put to the forthcoming Moore conference on wage fixation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Did the Australian Labor Party promise prior to its assumption of office on 2 December 1972 that there would be better industrial relations if it were to assume office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am unable to see in the chamber at the moment the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but we will soon be able to say of him a parody which was said of others almost 20 years ago, namely: ‘You will all be cool in Cameron’s pool’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we want to- know the exact position with regard to fuel and- oil supplies in Australia as the question has been raised about the adequency of supplies, I have mentioned it and my colleague, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will be dealing with the industrial aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740917_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  had announced that he felt that unemployment was going to grow to massive proportions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, on seasonally adjusted figures, the number of unemployed is now 134,000- the highest it ever reached in the period when I was Treasurer of the McMahon Government, in 1972, and the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was saying: ‘Beware! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, as he now is, and the present Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, were saying: ‘We will get an unemployment figure of a quarter of a million.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the admission of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Overseas Trade know- in fact, any member of the Labor Party or the Labor Government who knows B from a bull’s foot knows- that unemployment in Australia will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The silence of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Transport from 26 July to early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The charges are fairly against the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  and fairly against the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is especially important since there has been complete silence from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for a period of 6 to 8 weeks- silence over a much longer period, possibly over a year, if the allegations of  Mr Elliott  of the Seamen’s Union are correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister for Transport and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> an opportunity to clear their names in relation to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said quite plainly that the only thing wrong with the extortion, with the indemnity payments, was the direction of the funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That again emphasises the need for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to clarify these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740918_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then we have the question of the silence not only of the Minister for Transport who is principally culpable in this matter but also of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that letter there was no evidence of any kind of action or activity by the Minister for Transport or by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> until the matter inadvertently appeared in the Press in Melbourne about six or seven weeks later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You may feel that, in the first instance, perhaps it would be appropriate for officials of our two Departments together with officers of the Attorney-General’s Department, Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Treasury to meet next week with a view to preparing a report on the possible courses of action open to Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I returned to my office on Monday, 2 September, at about 9 a.m. my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  rang me in Newcastle in relation to this matter and put to me the proposition that we should have a royal commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to know whether the terms of reference of the Royal Commission will bring to light the reason that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been so tardy in his action in handling this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why the ACTU was elbowed to one side, the interplay of union rivalries and the dislike for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are all matters which could be brought to the fore and we would be able to obtain a certain amount of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Cameron,  today condemned the practice of maritime unions demanding payments to allow the movement of ships around the Australian coast, and then paying the money into union funds rather than to the crew members of the ships involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740919_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Western Australia, the Honourable Bill Grayden, or William Grayden I suppose I should say, soon after his appointment received a letter from the  Chairman  for Landall Construction and Development Company Pty Ltd requesting a revision of these conditions governing the acceptance of personal nominations from private development companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that immediately or very shortly after the Minister received the request from the Landall company, he decided to revoke the 2 rules which the Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had previously agreed upon so that there would no longer be the necessity, which previously would have operated, of letting migrants know something about the law before they entered into these contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disproportionate burden of complaint from Landall nominees was a matter of very great concern to my colleague, the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and he took steps to see that an inquiry was made into them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> by saying that recently in Sydney the employees of a small textile manufacturer were stood down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Urban and Regional Development to take up with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  the fact that some assistance could be given to country towns which do not have sewerage under the regional unemployment grant scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-I address a question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the necessary investigations which must be carried out by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> before people can be granted approval to migrate to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give consideration to increasing the staff of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Fiji to enable the more expeditious processing of these applications for permanent entry to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any of them are concerned about their status they should contact the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> where their problems, if any, will receive sympathetic consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within 3 days of arrival it is incumbent on the company to convey its nominees to the State <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Office so that they may be given an advisory talk on such subjects as home purchase contracts, hire purchase, employment, vehicle purchase, over-commitment, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any type of contract or agreement for the purchase of a home must not be entered into prior to the advisory talk given by an officer of the State <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the defeat of the Labor Government in Western Australia the  Chairman  of the Board of Directors of the Landall Construction and Development Co. Pty Ltd wrote to the new Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Western Australia,  Mr Grayden,  in these terms, after having had first of all a telephone conversation with him and, no doubt, given him the private reasons why he wanted these conditions set aside: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has the most peculiar habit of avoiding the topic under discussion, that is, the Australian Government’s involvement in what can only amount to a contempt of court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said in this House on thousands of occasions, when governments learn to keep their noses out of industrial relations perhaps the unions and the employers will solve the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-21-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 12 months the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has ducked and weaved his way through questions from the Country Party on rural unemployment relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is not listening to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is evolving a scheme to assist these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in the course of his address this morning <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should apply for assistance to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  now talks about a scheme to help with unemployment relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I said was that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been talking about unemployment relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  persists in leaving out school leavers from the unemployment statistics, I will never understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened to the answer given by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the question asked by the honourable member for Denison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was not only exercising his responsiblity, but he was exercising it well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In passing, let me add that I believe this indexation should apply to all award wages and salaries without the kind of fiddle which the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has suggested, because I believe that it will be more difficult to preserve industrial peace if we do not preserve full wage relativity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who said recently that if 100,000 people were unemployed approximately 40,000 of those would be unemployable, such as the mentally retarded who do not qualify for an invalid pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the Regional Employment and Development program which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  proudly refers to as the RED program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was the Royal Commission not told to investigate the prima facie fact that on 26 July, for example, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  knew that money was being extorted by threat, and knew that the threats were a criminal act, yet they did not refer this matter to the Royal Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will resume his seat and the honourable member for Wannon will resume his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rang the Commonwealth Police and Customs officials, who act for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when someone is leaving the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lance Johnston; and that they were meeting the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities early the next morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At about 3 o’clock on the Monday afternoon I heard that Georgi Ermolenko had gone from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office at 11 a.m. to the Parmelia Hotel, to which all the Russians had returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lance Johnston and  Mr Badger  had been prevented by police, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials and other departmental officials from actually seeing Ermolenko or indeed any of the other Russians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rang a representative of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Perth,  Mr Henne,  to ask that they assure me that they personally had talked privately with Ermolenko and had received an assurance that he had changed his mind and wished to return to Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not forget that when Ermolenko emerged from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office in St George’s Terrace, Perth, he gave an interview to the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in reply to a telegram from me said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely it must be clear even to the most obtuse of the Government’s Ministers that it is no real answer to unemployment to take a man who has been working in some special field and offer him employment as a labourer in the building of a swimming pool or toilets in Tasmania or something of that nature, as was referred to by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in this House yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has this information, it will be in a much better position to advise applicants for adult retraining as to what training will best guarantee their future security of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal matter I raise this evening concerns the reply of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to a question asked of him by  Mr Dawkins  last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of his answer on 24 September the Minister mentioned that a conference of Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in November 1973 agreed on South Australian rules respecting the nomination of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No evidence was produced by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to back up these statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grayden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 26 September 1974, in answer to a question from me, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer next to a telegram from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following instructions by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a review of these conditions was undertaken - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to that statement,  Mr Grayden  sent the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a telegram and he sent a copy of it to me also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has not done that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Landall offered to co-operate fully with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> task force operating in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  of Lan.dall,  Mr Clark,  wrote also to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 19 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put this question to the House,  Mr Speaker:  Is this the action of a company which, in the words of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, was engaged in some very questionable activities or was a questionable company in more ways than one? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did not the Minister mention the additional protection given by rules 12 and 13 in the new rules brought down by the new Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the flammability brochure was distributed through the Royal Melbourne Childrens Hospital and the then Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: the buyers guide for colour television will be distributed through the Australian Government Bookshops. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-37-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of those people who voted for Labor in the last elections now realise 4 months later that the situation has grown so bad in Australia that we have had to drastically curtail the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program started after the Second World War by a previous Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who is at the table at the moment, that the statistics show that 130,000 people are unemployed, but his confrere in Queensland,  Mr Jack  Egerton, the Queensland  President  of the Trades and Labour Council, estimates the true figure to be 200,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  was appointed as spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to read to the House from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association’s publication called ‘Viewpoint’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a trip to Canberra with my wife and another member of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association we dropped in to the House of Representatives to talk to a few of the members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to note that the honourable member for Warringah has been appointed to a position which is particularly sensitive to the propositions of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No, I will not take advantage of it, but I think it is important, when a sitting member of this Parliament becomes identified with the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association or the National Director of the Australian League of Rights, that it is made clear that he does not speak for the whole of his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741015_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that last night I made serious allegations against him and against the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was referring to  Mr Eric  Butler in the case of the honourable member for Parramatta, and to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association in the case of the honourable member for Warringah. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has not seen fit to dissociate himself from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association and from its support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is necessary in order to bring these allowances into line with those payable to trainees under the national employment and training system which was recently introduced by my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, those in a position to know the consequences of this legislation in a good deal of detail object to its being put through at this point in the way in which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of record that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> meets his State counterparts frequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as I can recall from the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  no examples were given of the need for that discretion to be given to the Registrar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  seems to be becoming sensitive in his second youth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think we ought immediately to expose one of the statements by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  which he made in discussing this clause, clause S. He repeatedly said that this clause will validate certain situations within organisations and unions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having some knowledge- perhaps minute compared with that of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who is at the table- of the affairs of the Australian Workers Union and the battle that has gone on over the years between those 2 legal entities, I could not see the State union readily agreeing to transfer its funds to the Federal union; nor would the State union agree to allow itself to be absorbed into the Federal union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be for one of two reasons, either that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  does not know what the Bill provides for in its legal implications or it is being deliberately inserted to enable a federal organisation to exclude from its branches the opportunity to participate within a State industrial jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The burden of my interest is related to the previous case which I put to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As we are now dealing collectively with a number of clauses I shall deal quickly with some of those that I think require an explanation by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because they refer not only to serious legal questions but also to serious practical consequences for the unions who must participate within this jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither in the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> nor in anything we have heard in this Committee debate has the Minister justified the grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal organisation in these fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not putting that to be vexatious but just to ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  for an answer to the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Wannon also accused the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  of having an ulterior motive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is to be commended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is at the table, is one who has had a great deal of experience in this industrial field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  purports to represent unionism in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be, as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said in this House, that this will reduce inter-union disputes and legal difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my inimitable way I have written a paper which perhaps is not as over-powering as the persuasiveness of my claims on the Regional Employment and Development scheme as outlined by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  today, but at least it is a concrete contribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that a royal commission has been set up by the Government on the initiative of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  to inquire into this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> say, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, on 17 September 1972, that a Labor Government would adopt the 1970 submission of the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations to repeal sub-regulation 34(a) and regulation 35 of the Public Service Regulations and to substitute a regulation recording it as a disciplinary offence for an officer to disclose or make use of information gained by him by reason of his office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-55-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a deal between <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Foreign Affairs, probably worked out between  Senator Willesee,  who is desperate to get elected to the presidency of the United Nations, and  Mr Cameron  who is Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, in the course of his answer, mentioned that a question had been asked of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> specifically did not mention the name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> specifically did not mention the name or the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have written a letter to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> seeking further information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned in that letter that I would honour any restrictions the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would put on my reading the file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Cameron, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has written publicly to the Treasurer demanding a change in the course of economic policy;  Mr Hayden  believes that the Government is presiding over the destruction of the Australian economy;  Dr Cairns,  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, thinks that the fault lies with the system; the Treasurer,  Mr Crean  has now identified some economic problems but hopes that they will simply go away; and the Prime Minister has not expressed any view at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> boasted publicly in September, in a story headlined ‘All Better in a Year- Cameron’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, recent statements by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  would rather support that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The primary responsibility for enforcement of Fisheries, Customs, Quarantine and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Laws lies with appropriate civil agencies of both the Australian and State Governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741022_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-52-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The failure of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to uphold the 30 year agreement by Australian Governments to maintain full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who has a smile creasing his face, to contemplate the situation in Australia today for which he is responsible without any apparent concern is for him to commit the gravest fault against the memory of his own Party, but more significantly against his obligations to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Nothing that has been said should be taken as an indication that I think the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or the Government looks with pleasure upon the present employment situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deals with the alleged failure of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to uphold the 30-year agreement by Australian governments to maintain full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have listened for some time to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  hoping that he might show some real concern and show some indication of wanting to prepare policies that would relieve the acute unemployment that is present in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> unaware that there was a tight monetary policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> suggest that he was not responsible for these particular policies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only difference is that now under a Labor Government with the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the predictions that he made will come true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But is anyone, the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister, going to take any notice of this Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister wants to leave behind him a proud record as Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and I give him credit for having that wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I would like to refer to the statement by the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is referring only to unemployment figures which exclude school leavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr CLYDE CAMERON (HindmarshMinister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>)-  Mr Speaker,  I wish to make a personal explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar)- With your indulgence,  Mr Speaker,  I wish to say that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said rather slightingly that there had been, I think, 1 1 widow trainees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Last Thursday in this House I asked a question of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in relation to the regional employment development scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask you,  Mr Speaker,  why there would need to be 4 RED Ministers- the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation  (Mr Stewart),  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> took it on himself to handle it all from Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are approximately 900 local authorities in Australia, all making submissions to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States opened the door wide, and what did the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since January 1970 the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and its predecessors have been collecting data on persons registered with its Employment Service who are seeking part-time work and since January 1973 the Department has been collecting information on vacancies for parttime workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Women’s Bureau of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been active in seeking to secure a wider acceptance of part-time employment as a regular feature of the employment market structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741023_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  at one stage produced an entirely new Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741024_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition there is the regional employment development scheme- RED- which is administered by my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and which is also designed to fund moneys to towns like Launceston in Tasmania so that they can better improve facilities in those towns-the infrastructure, the building of recreational community halls and houses and that sort of thing- so that the people in them have a better standard of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the general criterion under which the scheme is operating on instructions sent out from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  accused me of being involved in a conspiracy with one of the biggest shipping firms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely ask the Minister for Northern Development and the Minister for the Northern Territory to speak to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about this legislation because, if accepted, it will drive shipping off the north coast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This thinking was introduced again in this place by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  who seemed to be saying that he wanted the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to make sure that any ships coming into the Port of Darwin would be unloaded by Transport Workers’ Union labour rather than by Australian Waterside Workers’ Federation labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers have been assisted by senior colleagues such as the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitiam)  the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in creating a serious situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither has the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been able to supply this information in reply to the many questions, letters and telegrams I have addressed to him asking for specific details. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tragedy is that during the first year of the Australian Labor Party Government the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  adopted an encouraging stance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  should investigate ways and means of providing benefits for our communities in return for the moneys paid out in unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few days ago the ‘Australian Financial Review’ reported that Australia’s main Public Service union had called for the Federal Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to be sacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unemployment is rising dramatically, and there is a greater muddle and mess in the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> than there has ever been before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that I cannot table documents in Committee but I would ask the Minister whether he is prepared to allow the incorporation in Hansard of a circular of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> dated 26 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four different people at different levels in the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> told me that the allowance was tax free and that instructions had been sent to every Commonwealth Employment Service officer saying that it was tax free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to address my remarks to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but specifically to one relatively small aspect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is aware of the question I am going to raise and basically it is this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly, about one year ago, it was decided by the Australian Government in its wisdom- or lack of wisdom- that these people could not be considered for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Australia unless they had a passport which was stamped showing Australia as one of the countries for which it was valid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I approached the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the present Minister for the purpose of obtaining a concession and discussing the cases on their merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we accept the proposition of the police forces of those totalitarian regimes that these people are suitable for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Australia or do we use other methods? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has drawn the attention of the chamber and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to a situation which does require close investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather sad that the Committee, in looking at the estimates for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, is observing in relation to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> side of things the demolition of a department which once was held in very great esteem and which played a tremendous part in the development of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in the past the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has paid a series of tributes to the personnel of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for the work that they did on behalf of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that he, like I, will be saddened by some of the figures set out in the estimates for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1) 1974-75 that the amount for the item concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span> studies and research is down from the appropriation of $92,000 last year to the appropriation of $9,400 this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think those two amounts which I have drawn out as examples show very clearly the way in which the Labor Government has moved very quickly since the election on 1 8 May to dismember and despatch the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most members of this chamber and, I am sure, most people in Australia have a very clear idea of the benefits which have accrued to this country from the major <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which has been going on since the end of the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the break-up of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> proceeding apace which will have 2 very real effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a very great effect also on the public servants who previously made up the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have travelled around’ Australia talking to the various members of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the various States and I have sensed a very real feeling not only of sadness but also of great disillusionment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the figures when they are revealed will show a great number of resignations by previous members of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as this disillusionment, frustration and concern about career prospects takes its toll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are foreign policy implications about any nation’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rather than building up international goodwill by the application of the new policies of the Labor Government in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, in fact we are running the very real risk that international goodwill will be broken down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this Government gave a guarantee that it would be brought in earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also give us an opportunity to have a full scale debate on this important area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  reputation is well known to most honourable members, particularly to former Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been given examples of his behaviour by a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of some years back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the description of him as given to me by that former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is true, he is beneath my contempt and I will have nothing to do with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is intemperate and I believe his vindictive outbursts not only against myself in the present administration but also against Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in former administrations achieve absolutely nothing for those on whose behalf they are purported to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard I speak not only for myself but also for former Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in previous Liberal and Country Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The easy visa system was introduced to permit genuine visitors to come to Australia with a minimum of inconvenience in respect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> formalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that on this point, as is usual with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters, my opposite number in the Opposition agrees with my comments in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by and large, the visitors themselves cannot be exonerated from complicity in a calculated evasion of Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to know how many thousands of men and perhaps women, because we have found Filipino women who have been exploited in this way, are working in Australia at near slave rates of pay under threat of deportation by their employers who have only to say: ‘Listen, if you are going to kick up a row about it or join the union I will ring the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and tell them where to locate you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  spoke for about 30 minutes but no doubt before this debate is concluded members of the Opposition will be gagged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter I want to raise is in relation to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> part of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that our policy has drifted away from the original one laid down by the first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the late A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, his policy was to lift the population of Australia through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but at the same time keep a homogeneous population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The immediate past Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recently said that any Australian Minister, public servant or government worker would be sacked on the spot if he sought to promote discrimination on the grounds of race, colour or creed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In past years <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been a subject of non political consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the future policy would be based on family reunions and that this would play a very important role in relation to incoming migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am also conscious of what can happen if a country adopts a policy of pleasing all, as our immediate past Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was only too quick to try to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To see how our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy will affect Australia in the long term one need only look at the position in the United Kingdom at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time will not allow me to go into all the ramifications of this Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but I should like to mention some other points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to substantiate a case which I wish to make against the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is, of course, responsible for Government policy but I believe that the previous Minister,  Mr Grassby,  must be condemned for allowing trained political activists to come into this country with no real intention to abide by this nation’s principles or aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My evidence for this comes from a Chilean from my own electorate who happened to be at the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Adelaide where he had to help to interpret for a large group of immigrants who arrived from the Adelaide airport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chileans who in the past paid their own way to this country are properly offended that these people should be termed Chileans and they wish to be entirely dissociated from the kind of people whom the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> brought into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not blame the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers who were sent to Chile to augment the meagre numbers of people examining those so-called Chileans seeking entry into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened is also an indictment against the Prime Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of that time for taking measures that did not ensure proper safety for this nation in the importation of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ought to commend the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  for the way in which he has gone about his task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A very good example of this occurred last year when  Mr Grassby,  the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, visited the Philippines and told them that the White Australia policy was dead and buried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within days not only something like 40,000 Filipinos were at the gates of the Australian Mission but also there was a similar situation in Rangoon where there were 10,000 Burmese beating at the gates of the Australian Mission and Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> application forms were being sold in the streets of Rangoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741030_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to raise a matter which I would have raised yesterday in the debate on the estimates for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had time permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973-74 the grant by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the National Safety Council was $100,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem appropriate to say to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> now, in case we are confronted with a fait accompli and find job advertisements in the newspapers setting out details of the bureaucracy, that he may not be consulted in any substantive way about the Bill when it eventually comes into the form of a national safety and rehabilitation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the Government would do well to examine its own estimates for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to find ways of transferring funds to the National Safety Council in the short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> give serious thought to transferring part of the $3m allocated for trade union training to industrial safety, because often it is the unionists who need to be made aware of the need for industrial safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will know that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  in a Press release on 1 1 September, announced the details of the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> replied, inter alia: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention in passing that when I went to the office of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  I was treated extremely courteously not only by the Minister but also by officers of his Department who were available to talk to aU honourable members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The right honourable member is obviously referring to a speech entitled “Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making Democracy Democratic” delivered by the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 17 September 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards industrial disputes, the matter has had the attention of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and where appropriate direct representations have been made to the unions involved with the aim of minimising the disruption to wheat shipments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>26 of 1974 from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  entitled ‘Provisional Commonwealth Employment Service Statistics October 1974’ and the attached tables. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The official figures released by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for September show that 36 per cent of those out of work were under the age of 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare this with the statement made on 21 April, before the last election, by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Cameron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was the economy allowed to deteriorate to this point when the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been estimating for months that unemployment would rise as much as it has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why was no action taken when the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> wrote to the Treasurer urging a change of course? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will demand that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> be heard in complete silence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is the Minister who not so many months ago was saying that wages do not increase prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition heard something last night and they will hear something more tonight which will show beyond doubt that this Government and this Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  are not committed in any way, shape or form to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  started his speech with a falsehood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened in Australia is as a result of the Government’s tariff decisions, the wage policies followed earlier by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the unreasonable growth in Government expenditure and the Government’s foolish and incompetent policies in trying to overcome the difficulties that were created by its own mismanagement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  introduced amendments to the Liberal-Country Party Government’s Act of November 1972, and if those amendments had been carried by the Senate they would have been both far reaching and expensive and would have added to the pace setter role of the Commonwealth Public Service, which at that time was Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is certainly a most undesirable situation and one into which I believe that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has a great responsibility to look very deeply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741112_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I give an important example: The Government’s national employment and training scheme does require the recruitment of a relatively small number of officers to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to help implement the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they do so they will see that whenever the Prime Minister or  Mr Grassby  visited South East Asia there was an enormous increase in applications for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will recall that, when, recently, he opened the annual conference of the South Australian Good Neighbour Council he stated that the Government had now imposed quotas on migrant source countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741114_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In return for the thinnest of hopes, based on the flimsiest of logical foundation, governments of different political persuasions have imposed a price control stranglehold on British business and have been afraid to tax either corporations or individuals at realistic rates and have gone in for policies of levelling downwards which must soon begin to show themselves in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw the Government, from the Prime Minister downand apparently in a speech yesterday even the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)-  appreciating the significance of private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The balance will be expanded by other departments such as the Department of Education for study grants and secondary grants and special programs in the Northern Territory, by the Department of Health in the Northern Territory, and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> under its employment training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to understand the background of what might appear to be a simple, technical measure if one read carefully the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having given that background to the general exemption in paragraph (n) I should like to come to the speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because in 2 points he made an error in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only assume from discussion between many people and officers of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that that is not the Minister’s intention because there are a large number of ports around the Australian coastBell Bay would continue to be one as are Whyalla, Gove, Weipa, Groote Eylandt, Ardrossan, and Port Lincoln, to name a few- where the company concerned generally uses its own facilities and its own labour to load or unload ships when there is not a register of waterside worker labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On that basis the Opposition would oppose that extension of the amendment which has been moved by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On advice available to me that will enable the situation to remain as it has been in ports outside Darwin, largely company ports, where it is important in a high cost situation to have an efficient use of labour as I am sure the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would readily recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  pointed out in the second reading debate, the clause suggested in this Bill goes beyond what was seemingly intended by the Government and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in his second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of that situation the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has taken the opportunity to try to extend the language of the exemption, but in a way which will limit the area of the exemption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That may well be what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> intends, but he must know the ramifications of it if it is what he intends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Following the May election of this year the Government decided to abolish the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, a good friend of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam), Mr Evasio  Costanzo wrote in ‘La Fiamma’ that Labor had killed <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He tried to justify the decision and to prove that the dismemberment of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was not a process of killing Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at events that have occurred since we find that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> tap as it is sometimes described has been turned off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in a Press statement that he could not responsibly approve the entry of migrants who were likely to experience difficulty in finding and holding employment and who would be competing with Australians and migrants already here in the tight sections of the labour market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In abolishing the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> it is clear that the Australian Labor Party, despite its earlier protests, believes that migrants should be treated as cannon fodder for industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the statement to which I referred previously, issued by the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 2 October, one will see that he said that it would be damaging and he would be acting contrary to the Australian Labor Party’s platform if he were to bring migrants here at this time when we cannot ensure that they will find long term employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision to turn off the tap is really a decision either to close down the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme altogether or it is a guise to introduce quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will the quotas be when the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> tap is turned on, if it is to be turned on by this Government, when conditions change? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that from the time the Labor Government decided to dismantle the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> it could not decide which department would be responsible for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a period of uncertainty, a period of ministerial wrangling, the responsibility for citizenship was left with that section of the old Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which had been transferred to the Department of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741120_reps_29_hor92/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go a little bit further and deal with statements made by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and an unfortunate statement made by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  for whom nobody on this side of the House has any ill will whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a statement by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who said: ‘We believe in a full employment society’, while at the same time he was deliberately driving Australians into an unemployed society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  an outstanding orator with great knowledge of industrial relations, forthright with unions and employers, who in every way gives an inspiring example of what should be done by Ministers of integrity and honesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the provision of grants for training within industry, which is the province of my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  was excluded from the Kangan Committee’s terms of reference, it will be recognised that the program we are putting forward will be of some consequence in providing the buildings, the equipment and the trained staff to cater for those people who undertake courses of training or re-training at technical colleges under the national employment and training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For years I sat on the other side of the chamber and listened to blasts from the present Minister for Transport and the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  telling us why we would never get industrial peace while there are sanctions and the force of arbitration in industrial law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and myself have had the courage to stand up to these people and to stop them standing over the airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to say something this evening in regard to the question that I asked this afternoon of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was rather disappointed that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> went off on a sidetrack and talked about his own experiences and his appreciation of certain problems and difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are wool selling organisations, transport organisations, wool classing, storage facilities, and the people who shear the sheep, the members of the great Australian Workers Union, which spawned such great people as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young),  all products of the AWU. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, is supplementary to that recently answered by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Aside from the matters which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has mentioned what does the honourable gentleman, now looking back, say to this increasing number of trade unionists to explain why this country today has a level of inflation unprecedented in recent years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  say that commissioners will be appointed for fixed terms, taking away the independence that they ought to have, the independence that has traditionally been part of this kind of operation so that governments could not lean on individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wondered whether the Prime Minister was aware that an answer was given to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)even  the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  and perhaps the honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Keogh)  might have read it- which demonstrated that the travel by ground transport with a chauffeur by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this Parliament was greater per week than my travel per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am delighted to see that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has such boisterous enthusiasm for such a curious proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>That is a pretty proud record for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and his Prime Minister whom he was praising so greatly yesterday as having performed so much for the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance the 25 per cent tariff cuts without examination; the successive revaluations; the unreasonable government spending leading to inflation; an initial wage policy which added very greatly to inflation, which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has at last come to recognise and which the Prime Minister has more recently come to recognise; the policies of the Prices Justification Tribunal which were designed to squeeze companies and  profits so  that there would be nothing left for reinvestmentthis has been recognised far too late by the Prime Minister in his letter to the Prices Justification Tribunal- and the credit squeeze itself which is causing many firms to become bankrupt and many others to put off employees in an effort to survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> started by saying March but when the recent survey of manufacturing prospects was put out by the Department of Manufacturing Industry and when a forward look is taken at what is happening in the economy, one finds that it is most unlikely that there will be any change in present trends in March, April, May or June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has set up a Regional Employment Development scheme for the country; a Regional Employment Development scheme for the city; National Employment and Training proposals which are still far from the objectives which I think the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would want; and the income maintenance scheme which is utterly unfair because why should those who are out of work as a result of a tariff decision receive preferred treatment to those who are out of work as a result of a credit squeeze? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that when the Prime Minister reshuffles his Cabinet- it is a pity that he cannot shuffle some of his Ministers out of the Ministry, but he has not the power to do it- he should make the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Minister for Public Works or give him some portfolio right out of the public arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It makes speeches from on high, and the trade union movement thumbs its nose at the Government, as it does at the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An attack was made by members of the Opposition on the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I reiterate the figures given by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I want to follow the line put forward by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who has done more for the working people of Australia than any previous Minister for Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the only government which has attempted to retrain the working people in this country under the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whom honourable members opposite say has done nothing to contribute to the lifestyle of the Australian working people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison)  has suggested today that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had sufficient guts to talk about Jewish <span class="highlight">immigration</span> with the Russians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his wonderful achievements in the external fields, why was it that in one country alone on his visit- I refer to Holland- he was prepared to accept in his discussions on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that there should be a preparedness by the Australian Government to consider an increase in migrants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did not the Prime Minister visit the Middle East, another area about which there is tremendous concern in Australia and a source of a good deal of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750211_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to say: ‘Do not worry, we will retrain them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have with me a document entitled ‘Monthly Review of the Employment Situation, October 1974’ from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government decisions have created large pools of unemployment and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is introducing retraining schemes that have very little chance of success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, apart from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, responsibilities for specific Aboriginal programs are carried by the Departments of Education, Health, Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Services and Property, the Public Service Board and the Australian Council for the Arts, which provide services in consultation with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-64">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-80">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the Minister receive advice from the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Depanment of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant welfare, information, education and the issue of passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-88">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, has the Minister been advised by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> no longer intends to open in Parramatta an office specialising in migrant affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750212_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-30-88">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  whom I informed that I would be speaking today, to take a personal interest in this matter because it is absolutely ridiculous that these people who have been given hope that they would be retrained after losing their jobs are continuing to sit at home awaiting word from the Government as to whether or not they have been accepted for retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who is at the table and who I notice is greatly alarmed at the revelations that I have made in the House today, will tell both the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  that they had better read the grievance day debate today because Cameron said something of note again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether entry visas have been granted during the period since the Labor Party came to power to representatives of the PRG and African liberation movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it a fact that considerable delays are still taking place in payments to retrenched employees in country industries adversely affected by tariff decisions of the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delays are due to the fact that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is determined that it will see that there is no slipshod manner of handling both of these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware that during 1974 the unemployment rate in Australia moved from approximately 1.2 per cent of the work force to approximately 4.5 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Unemployment- I beg his pardon; he is called the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but one would never know that labour is bis responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  refused even to consider the continuation of rural unemployment relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But after the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and other Ministers hurl abuse across the Pacific at the United States, what interest has the United States Administration in keeping the access to that market for beef that we once had? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that story is confirmed, as I believe it most certainly will be, it is a disgraceful use of the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> power and its visa power to give the Prime Minister an apparent trade victory as a result of that particular venture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the figures of the Department pf Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who, in January of this year, said that the clothing, textile and footwear industries had no place in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said they have no place in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: If his name was Clyde Cameron and he was a Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and had a union objecting so strongly to the proposals of the Government, would he continue to implement those proposals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interjections of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  during the second reading debate were quite false and wrongly based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding proposed section 158M, it is simply not sufficient for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to say that the Commonwealth Electoral Office is obliged to dispatch ballot papers to all members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> opposed quite vigorously the industrial court legislation of the Liberal-Country Party Government when he was in Opposition with his colleague, the then honourable member for East Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time as the then honourable member for East Sydney was growing old, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, was having his own fight with the Australian Workers Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the tragedies of the honourable member for Hindmarsh is that he has carried that fight into the Parliament as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  did not make a proper speech last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On a number of occasions the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has brought similar legislation before this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That special action had to be taken by this Government, of which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> presumably is a supporter, to support 3 large multinational companies, but the Government did nothing for those Australian companies which were in equally difficult circumstances and which were placed in those circumstances as a result of the actions of this Government and this Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is probably the greatest Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that this country has ever had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He paid a very fine tribute to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, in his second reading speech, said that the number of trade unions in Australia has been slowly declining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally it was part of a much larger Bill, the first one of which was introduced by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he occupied that portfolio after the election of the present Government in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But one thing can be said against that background: At least the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is a trier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was said- I will not mention the person’s name because it might be improper to name an officer of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- that:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that no more interim grants are to be made in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Miss Morosi sponsored the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia of a number of Filipino girls and forced them to work for $25 per week of which $ 10 weekly was paid as keep to Miss Morosi ‘s mother. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure to be taken in such cases is that the Department of Housing and Construction refers the tenders concerned to 4 other advising departments- Treasury, Customs and Excise, Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Manufacturing Industry- for their views as to whether or not the tender as recommended by the Department should be accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These include a payment of $2m to the Medical Research Endowment Fund and contributions to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and to the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine, $500,000 each; $ 1.1m for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for additional staff; $ 1.35m for the Australian Film Corporation; $723,000 for the Interim Committee for the Children’s Commission, $650,000 for additional staff for members and senators; $500,000 for grants to eligible organisations under the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act; $537,000 for Expo 75 at Okinawa; $lm subsidies on ship construction and amounts of $6.2m and $5.3m for the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory Education Services respectively for additions to staff establishments and other increased costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he did try to answer, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  as is his wont, would run back and forth to the table raising points of order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> tried quietly to warn him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he receive advice from the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant welfare, information, education and the issue of passports <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-19">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, despite the absence of an office of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a welfare team comprising social workers and bi-lingual welfare officers speaking the languages of the major migrant groups operates in the Parramatta area as the need arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750225_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  administers, amongst other Acts, the Migration Act 1958-73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much as the Minister would like it, the question is not how the House of Commons should act in relation to one of its own members; the question clearly lies with the Australian Government and its Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has the power to enforce that requirement and he should exercise it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has followed his usual line of appearing to be a reasonable individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what he has been doing since he became responsible for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, in dismantling a lot of the worst excesses of his predecessor,  Mr Grassby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is anybody in this House who is an archetype of the cynical politician it is the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr CLYDE CAMERON (HindmarshMinister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>)-  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I wish to make a personal explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this House would have the view that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has acted with every propriety and with good sense in respect of this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said he supported that concept but then he, and particularly his colleague the honourable member for Barker, launched a personal attack on the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for not having done something to remove  Mr Stonehouse  from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then he criticises the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for not having taken action to remove  Mr <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we have seen over the years, there are 2 ways of administering the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that had the honourable member for Warringah or the honourable member for Barker sought information concerning this matter in a sincere and genuine manner or for a sincere and genuine purpose that information would have been forthcoming privately from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They sought to come into this Parliament to try to score some fairly cheap political points, in my view, about the conduct of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in respect of what is a sensational matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately this morning the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was forced to make a public disclosure that  Mr Stonehouse  will be required to remove himself within 3 days or suffer the consequences of his having been expelled or having resigned from the House of Commons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He launched a vicious, personal attack on the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister’s actions are beyond reproach, that the Minister has shown himself to be one who has applied the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws with understanding and tolerance, and that above all he has maintained the convention and upheld the law in respect of the rights of members of Parliament of the British Commonwealth of Nations to visit Australia with impunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750226_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-17-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to substantiate that statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> be suspended from the service of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that clear background the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party moved that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> be suspended from the services of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be an administrative one which would gather under its umbrella all the housing areas which are at present administered by the Commonwealth Government, such as housing for Aborigines, certain <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures and defence service homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill we are discussing is another example of the Government’s bringing to itself power to deal with certain people in the community- and that is what has happened- while we abrogate our responsibility to deal with foreign affairs, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, defence- all the matters for which we have specific responsibility, about which I feel very concerned and on which I rarely have an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  because he and his colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  have done more in the last few months for the Australian building industry than the Opposition did in a quarter of a century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It has taken this Minister for Housing and Construction and the current Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to get the co-operation of those unions and the employers to train and retrain people in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When parliamentary members of the Labor Party accept the prescriptions of Caucus and when they accept the restraints that the Prime Minister today demonstrably placed upon the then  Speaker  and upon the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  but refused to place on the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  we do not believe that any member of that Party can be seen as being prepared to comply with the Standing Orders and to maintain the dignity of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He not only intimidated the former  Speaker,  he also took unto himself the role of answering for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only did the Prime Minister abuse, intimidate, destroy and answer for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but he also interfered in the duties of the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter concerns 2 private students from Malaysia who entered Methodist Ladies’ College at Kew in Melbourne with student visas from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> at the commencement of 1973 with the aim of obtaining their Higher School Certificates in 1 974 and subsequently pursuing a medical course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is at the table because the university year is about to commence and I think immediate action is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also I have received a letter from the principal of the Methodist Ladies College, Kew, advising me that 5 more Asian girls, one from Indonesia and four from Malaysia- I have their names here if either the Minister for Education or the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would like to have them- were interviewed by the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750227_REPS_29_HoR93b/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Cameron,  the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, said to the then  Speaker, Mr Speaker  Cope: ‘I don’t’ give a damn what you say’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Speaker  then named the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly),  knowing his duty, knowing the convention, started to move towards the despatch box to move the necessary motion for the suspension of the Minister from the service of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accused the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  of misleading the House on a matter where he subsequently admitted he was quite mistaken and that the Minister was quite correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  insulted and defied the  Speaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen, when it came to a choice of disciplining the wild and insubordinate Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or deserting the  Speaker  that he chose the latter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the personal explanation I told the Parliament that it was not true that I had refused to give the Opposition an opportunity to see what was in the Stonehouse file, that the spokesman for the Opposition on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> could have seen the file, that my personal secretary had indicated to him that the file would be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had been the personal assistant to the head of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Sir Peter  Heydon, before that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Wednesday 19 February I was approached by the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr MacKellar,  who said he was thinking of asking your permission to examine the Stonehouse file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He became Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but he was a dismal failure again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a further irony that the 3 saboteurs of the parliamentary system, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  should be the very people who come before this House in this censure debate to now seek to defend that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was, after all, the Prime Minister who prevented the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> from apologising to the Chair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The establishment by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of offices on the eastern shore of the Derwent have assisted thousands of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 regret that I only walked into the House a few minutes ago and that I have not had the time as I usually do to let the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> know what I was going to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I also say that, in the closing stages of his remarks, he was prepared to admit that he had not even bothered to follow the normal courtesies of the House by notifying the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  of his intention to make the remarks that he made here this evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750304_reps_29_hor93/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has done and what I am trying to do will be conducive to that end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administration of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been totally ill equipped to deal with the great addition in the number of people who have been applying for services and help from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because it is a Department which had been geared to a full employment situation and which has suddenly found itself having to deal with the situation of quite massive unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has put additional administrative responsibilities on the Department in the administration of the income maintenance scheme and in the administration of vague and far reaching retaining proposals and of other matters which have greatly increased the workload on the Department, leading to a general breakdown in administration at the grass roots level of the Department and to a great deal of hardship and inconvenience to many thousands of individuals throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more recently- in December 1974- the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a situation that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has in fact brought about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen further examples of difficulties arising between the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It pointed out that many unemployed people have been passed by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to charity agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He should have stood the Prime Minister up over that matter because of the workload that it placed on the people in the field from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  in answering the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  has shown that there is great validity in the general criticisms levelled by the honourable member for Wannon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member is the shadow Minister for labour and industrial relations I should have thought that he would have taken advantage of the mass of information that is available to him from the Department of our very fine Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel sure that the honourable member has read a document put out by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that there is any connection between the figures; I use them merely as an illustration of the fact- this has been said by both the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- that unemployment is not a phenomenon peculiar to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> answered very well the charges in relation to the working of the National Employment and Training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But allied with this I must speak, with regard to my own electorate, about the amount that is appropriated to assist starling in those organisations or in the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which have so much responsibility in these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will take no notice of the requests of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  or the Prime Minister to show caution and restraint and not to put in exaggerated wage claims in excess of the capacity of the community to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The appropriations for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> indicate that over $142m will be spent by the Department under subdivision 3., item 15. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out, the appropriation for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is $ 142 m which virtually will be used for unemployment purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to have a look at this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will support these appropriations because if we did not we would be committing the same act of blatant betrayal and callous unconcern towards the hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians whom this Prime Minister and his ally, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  have thrown on to the dole lines after promising so vehemently that it would not happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I would stress is that that stance in monetary policy was not a measure adopted to counter emerging inflation, which just dropped down from heaven or came in by ripples from another shore, as it was put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the delinquent but compliant Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has pointed out, people who are now entering the workforce may well need re-training several times during their working life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that  Mr Speaker  Cope acted with great restraint on that occasion, and no fair minded person would disagree with the contention that he was left with no option other than to name the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750305_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware of the recent dispute involving the sacking of 17 women at Dreffin Everhot Ltd, a manufacturing company in Bayswater, Victoria, in respect of which charges have been made by the sacked women that they have been sexually discriminated against? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With unemployment at a level of 3 1 1 000, even though the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  might foreshadow there may be some reduction in the present month, there is still no reason for complacency by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the elation of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  that the unemployment figures apparently dropped marginally in February, the fact that more than 300 000 Australians are unemployed is simply not good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One cannot help but feel that had the Government’s economic and tariff policies been different much of this expenditure would not have been necessary, and perhaps the Sl.lm provided in the Appropriation Bill for the purpose of engaging extra staff for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> could have been saved or put to a more productive purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> say, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, on 17 September 1972, that a Labor Government would adopt the 1970 submission of the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations to provide within the departments an identifiable authority to officially rule, in cases of doubt, whether an officer could release a particular piece of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-49-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consideration is being given at present to establishing, within the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, a Bureau of Labor Economics which will include an Office of Industrial Information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750306_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-49-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I believe it is very important to consider the basis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into a country when faced with problems such as those covered by the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An essential precondition for the solution of such problems within a community such as Australia’s is adequate control of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can agree or disagree with our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of the past but, taken in the broad and in no sense complacently, we have every reason to be enormously thankful for the capacity of newcomers to integrate and assist in the development of a fuller, more tolerant, more vigorous and more sophisticated Australian society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view it is essential that future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies recognise the inherent sovereignty of the host country in the control of the movement of people into that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spent some little time on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> aspects of the Bill and I have pointed out that the control of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> flow, whilst essential, does not solve the problems already existing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-As the Opposition has now turned the debate on this Bill into an attack on specific Government programs, I am more than happy to fall into line and follow the theme that has been established by my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  said, of course the Government is going to pour millions of dollars into Medibank to ensure that every man, woman and child is covered by a health scheme and not by the patched up job that existed under the control of 113 private health insurance companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  made great play of the fact that the people who sit on the Opposition side are very rich people- wool barons, oil barons, wealthy pastoralists and the privileged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is all right now in the short term, but in the long term somebody is going to pay for it; somebody is going to be jollywell hurt, and it could be the little people of this country, the poor people, the people whom the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  purports to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  told the House this afternoon that the Regional Employment Development scheme has been a significant factor in the Government’s stimulation of the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the expenditure policies of the Government, coupled with the wage policies earlier enunciated by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  that have led to an inflation greater than that which Australia has known before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only the Australian Labor Party Government that can be blamed for the consequences of revaluation, for the consequences of tariff cuts, for the consequences of the wages policy of the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, for the consequences of expenditure decisions and for their attack on business confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would establish close communications with employees and the trade union movement so that there can be a continuing dialogue and discussion, and reestablish in a statutory form the National Labour Advisory Council that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  abolished, thus cutting off proper tripartite communications between government, management and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  takes great pride in the fact that every month he is employing more people under the RED scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  stated to the House a couple of days ago, one benefit of the Regional Employment Development scheme is that it has enabled the CES to work test a substantial number of registrants by offering them jobs, in this way testing the validity of their registration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister.for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has often claimed the support of all members of Parliament for the RED scheme because all members have supported individual projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden),  the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  and many others have carried out vicious attacks on the Opposition’s suggestions for sound economic management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750417_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the Grants Commission in the first instance, and under the generous hand of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  the Regional Employment Development scheme has blossomed and is providing vast amounts of money to local government, also in questionable circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not referred to in the second reading speech made on behalf of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  by the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  but it gives a power to the  President  of the Commission to assign a commissioner to act as the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we would like to hear from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> just what the proposal means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not intend to go over the old ground which was mentioned briefly in the second reading speech given on behalf of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and, I think, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have on numerous occasions said that excessive wage claims are the main cause of inflation and unemployment in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I must admit that my confidence in the Government’s intentions was shaken at question time today when the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> indicated that if the wage indexation submission was not accepted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, he saw little cause to intervene in the metal trades case which will be considered subsequent to that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said, it was even possible for the  President  and the Vice-President of the United States of America and members of the President’s staff- people who were in the sanctuary, as it were, of American political reputationto be involved in this massive scandal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think that the interjection of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has absolutely nothing to do with this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  brings amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act into this Parliament they deserve better consideration and more sympathetic consideration than the Opposition has been prepared to give them, particularly in light of the experience gained by practitioners and others who particpate in the conciliation and arbitration procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall pluck out two or three lines which I think the Minister at the table, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  would agree in some way epitomise the feeling of this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most major dispute was increased to double the length of time that it should have lasted because of the interference by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, if I do not misquote the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, that he called the finding of the tribunal chaired by  Mr Justice  Coldham a decision that was ‘idiotic’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  that in this, and any future legislation that he brings before the House in relation to this most vital and important matter as far as the general state of our economy is concerned, he take notice of the point raised by the honourable member for Corangamite that due consideration should be given to the place of management in all his initiatives, and that particular reference be made to the right of the general public to expect top class service from the people who are protected as members of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only reaction I got on that day on which I spoke when I pointed out the position of these people- I spoke of how misunderstood they are, the extent of their handicap, how people showed them no patience, no understanding, because of their deafness- was for the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to sit on the front bench aping deafness and actually performing a comic opera which disgusted me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The unions have never in the past been able to take their proper place in society, but under this Government and as a result of actions taken by the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the unions will certainly get the recognition to which they are entitled in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sincerely hope that this Bill- the brainchild of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- when it is finally implemented can help by educating all members of society in restraint and co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as I have said, and as I will repeat, I compliment the Government and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  on the introduction of this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for introducing this legislation into the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street),  who is the shadow Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has said, if we were initiating trade union training we would have done it in a somewhat different fashion, in consultation with the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise the arguments which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has put and which I think he needed to put in the early days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great credit must be given to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  because he has done so much to bring our labour legislation into line with that which exists in other parts of the world and also in line with the International Labor Organisation Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have certainly not been persuaded by the sort of threats contained in the speech by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he introduced this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not as readily persuaded by the comments of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will not have to confess to a future parliament, as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  had to confess this afternoon, his inadequacy and neglect in this very important field, because the Minister and this Government have taken the initiative to try to cure some of these ills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the proposition put forward by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has quite rightly pointed out in his second reading speech that 53 per cent of the wage and salary earners in Australia belong to trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, one of the major problems we must face with this question is the danger that the trade unions will become too centralised in the sense that if all courses are to be run through this Authority, there is a very real danger, of which no doubt the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is aware, that if certain ideological sections of the community set out to gain control of this Authority, and in particular control of its syllabus, the implications for the settlement of industrial disputes in Australia is very serious indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has presided over the greatest unemployment in history and just as the Federal Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  has presided over the greatest inflation rate in the history of this nation, so the Minister for Transport has presided over the greatest destruction ever of the shipbuilding industry in this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me assure the honourable member that his own Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  recognises the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My first comment relates to a statement made by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has taken no action whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at another statement- a Press release by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, they are more empty words from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I continue my remarks to refer to an interview given by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the ‘A.M.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that there is a multi-million dollar racket in Australia at the moment in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to say that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has agreed to the establishment of a Commonwealth Employment Service office in Echuca but so far the Department of Social Security has not agreed to establish an office there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, this has occurred despite the fact that Australia has embraced a stagnant or very slowly growing work force and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates have been altered to bring down the unemployment rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministers for Education  (Mr Beazley),  Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  were all excluded on this ground, and responsibility was given to the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task forces are composed of existing staff in the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who have been temporarily released from their normal duties to provide emergency assistance in the Department’s Victorian Regional <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750513_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-35-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether he has received a request from the Australian Chamber of Commerce for the Government to cease all activities which interfere with complete freedom of private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to advise the House whether a visa has been granted to a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation whose name is Gamal Omar El-Surani to visit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In plain terms the Cabinet has been snowed’ by the support of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  for union wage claims beyond the wage fixation guidelines set down in the recent national wage decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have each abrogated their responsibilities in the face of threats by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has scorned his colleagues and the Australian public whose interest he has a direct obligation to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Commonwealth jurisdiction in this country is the saboteur of the policy of wage and salary restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is well aware that excessive wage and salary costs can price labour out of the market and can force up prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has deliberately, to use his own words uttered but a few years ago, ‘cooked the books’ to deceive and mislead the Australian public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The shadow Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has said that on a number of occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words ‘sabotage’ and ‘gutless’ are not quite the words that one would expect from the social background of the shadow Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but nevertheless they are commonly used in the House today by people of a similar social background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no mention of the public division between himself and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None other than the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> thought about this exposure of the results of his own deliberate policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> argued that, if only wage indexation were introduced, inflation would be well on the way to being controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> lost all his evangelical fervour for indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And there, like the Duke of Plaza Toro, leading his troops from behind, was the brave Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This result can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be said of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, like  Sir Christopher  Wren, ‘si monumentum requiris, circumspice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advertisements such as the one I have in my hand appeared in most of the Australian newspapers showing a photograph of the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are writs of which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who is at the table, has had great experience in industrial matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750514_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn next to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who perhaps should be called the Minister for unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that, some time in his rash career, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> made the statement that he would resign if unemployment ever exceeded 200 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only some 6 months before that time, he and the shadow Minister for labor, the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, were screaming that any government which faced an unemployment level of 100 000 or 1 10 000 persons should resign as it was not fit to govern a country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is misleading the people also inasmuch as, through the activities of his RED scheme, monetary assistance is being provided to place many people in jobs which have a temporary base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its inquiry, the Committee took evidence from the Departments of Services and Property, Social Security, Labor, now the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Overseas Trade, Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Department of Transport, and the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know what has happened over the last year through inflation, through rising taxation, through the wage policies of the Government, through the pace-setting principles of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case the departments of Customs, Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Manufacturing Industry, the Treasury, Overseas Trade and my own department were involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750515_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is he aware that the statistics of unemployed published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the month of February, the latest statistics available, showed the total number of unemployed persons seeking full time work to be approximately 70 000 fewer than the total number of such persons recorded by the Commonwealth Employment Service for the same month? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750519_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question which is addressed to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> refers to the reported continuing increase in housing costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the following day the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in reply to a similar question from the honourable member for North Sydney claimed that he did not know what the honourable member for North Sydney was talking about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> pointed out yesterday, the survey in September of last year revealed that 64 per cent of those who responded were unemployed, compared with 54 per cent in 1 963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am wondering now what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  would have to say if an already married member of Parliament returned from Bali, Djakarta or somewhere else and asked for the admission into Australia of a wife whom he had acquired or wooed and won in some foreign place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps this is a delightful and new way to get around our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws and to build up our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  on the clause relating to this, last evening referred to the injunctive process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not expect any sense or shush from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750520_reps_29_hor95/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to a letter issued by an insurance company in which that company threatens employees with loss of employment if they fail to sign petitions opposing the Australian Government Insurance Corporation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>764 in which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> mentioned the review by the Public Service Board of part-rime employment in the Public Service that has been under way for some considerable time, when will this review be completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750521_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Contrary to the views that are expressed by a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who is in the House at the moment and who so frequently says that the policy of the Opposition would be to retain a large percentage of unemployment, let me assure the Government and the Minister that it is not the policy of the Opposition to have unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750526_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to statements by  Mr Lee,  the Queensland Minister for Works and Housing, on the operation of the Regional Employment Development scheme in Queensland, alleging that it is necessary to dismiss employees of the State Department of Works through lack of funds and to re-employ them immediately on the same work under the RED scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>According to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  not less than 24 000 people are now employed under the RED scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a discrepancy of more than 50 000 between the figures on unemployment from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and unemployment figures from the Bureau of Statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was said by none other than the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who says he likes to look after everyone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750528_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since then I have had talks with the New Zealand Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Neither category would be entitled to entry in the normal course of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will come into the chamber during the course of my speech because I have had them both told that I intend to say something reflecting upon the administration of their Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I knew this on the basis of departmental published figures and from what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had said in this House in regard to those published figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That figure obviously shows something is wrong, but it is seen to be even more revealing when one considers the statement of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, who I see is now at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these reasons we have decided not to move amendments of this kind to the legislation but we bring the problem to the attention of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  as being worthy of careful consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been recognised by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have to ask ourselves- I know that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  would be asking himself this continually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> nods his head at that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I join in this debate to support the arguments of the honourable members for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  and Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  and to ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to give very serious consideration, as I know he will, to accepting the amendments moved by the honourable member for Corangamite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  responds to the gentle stimulus which we have provided by earlier amendments and by this amendment and brings in legislation of a permanent nature before 1 July 1976 then of course this legislation would cease to have effect as from that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750602_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It referred to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and myself and to statements we made in January 1974 rebutting a rather exaggerated claim about staggering levels of bogus unemployment benefit claims paid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been less communication and more abuse between this Prime Minister and the trade union movement or the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the trade union movement than I think we have seen in any government in the history of Australia since 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said today: ‘I am right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More often than not the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been right in a number of things he has said about the economy and growing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think if the Prime Minister wanted a responsible Treasurer he ought to consider the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as a Treasurer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to a statement by the New South Wales State Acting Minister for Local Government,  Mr Punch,  that the Regional Employment Development scheme was the most disgraceful waste of public money he had seen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was a fact which had apparently completely escaped the attention of the responsible Minister, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The man considering whether he will take advantage of this initiative finds that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  only a few weeks ago tried to convince Cabinet that it ought to support or at least not oppose an application before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for an increased wage for metal trades workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would be something like the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  racing out to address a mob of trade unionists and telling them, for instance, that the opposition of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the insertion of penal clauses in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act had collapsed because of the demonstration by those trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-28-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  realise that within one electorate there were some shires which did not get one allocation of RED money and yet the Commonwealth Employment Service office covered several who did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Curtin complained about a number of things involving the administration of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rapidity with which new applications for assistance under NEAT are being determined is in fact a tribute to the dedication, the efficiency and the very hard work of officers of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another case which he raised has been fully reviewed by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but also has been rejected on the ground that the person involved had voluntarily left employment to undertake training for an occupation for which there is a low labour market demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  has advised that the Department has virtually completed the review and it is hoped to provide project sponsors with firm details regarding the future of their projects by the end of this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member also raised an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should realise that the Minister receives approximately 65 000 representations per annum in respect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The nomination was sent to the chief <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer in Rome in the usual way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> reviewed the case in May of this year and confirmed the decision taken by officers of his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The action taken was to advise the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials at the Australian Embassy in Rome to review the case further. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After examination by the appropriate authorities in Australia the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials in Rome were advised to undertake a further examination, to seek a further review and to make a report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been most unreasonable and the accusation that he has made against the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, whom <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister Assisting the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> at the time went to Broken Hill and walked around like an undertaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night the Minister for Housing  (Mr Riordan),  in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this House, attempted to respond to certain instances that I had mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the Minister does not take it seriously and is attempting to brush it aside and assert that the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has done all that is possible in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add that I appreciate that the Minister has not been in this position for very long, nor has the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have an acknowledgement letter from  Mr Robert  Lawrence, the private secretary of the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, dated 7 May in answer to my representation of 28 April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I turn now to the infamous case of the application for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by some Italian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been aU this talk about receiving 65 000 representations in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> pOliCy, but who changed the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this project have the approval of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>; if so, when was this approval sought and given; if not, why not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The post-arrival welfare of migrants is no longer the resonsibility of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750827_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bells already have tolled for 2 former Treasurers, and others including the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard in this House on a previous occasion the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> take great credit for the improvement in unemployment figures as a result of his scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750828_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keeping that in mind, let me now quote in part from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> platform of the Australian Labour Party as defined at Terrigal in February this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labour supports an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mulvihill, Vice Chairman of the Federal Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Committee, said in an address entitled  Refugees in the World Today  delivered on Thursday of last week, that is, 28 August:  … the sympathy, understanding and tolerance with which the Government’s policies are administered apply no less strongly to refugees than to migrants generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause (f) of the policy which provides that there shall be no discrimination on grounds of race, nationality, politics, creed or sex lies at the heart of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as we have a global <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, so too we have within its non-discriminatory provisions a global refugee policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)-  formerly a senior Minister and formerly a Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, if I recall correctly, in a previous government- had no compunction at all about applying the same sorts of tests for other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Liberal-Country Party Government was discriminatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the events associated with the replacement of  Mr Cope  as  Speaker  revolved around the proposition that the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  had been offered information by an officer on the staff of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns comments on the National Employment and Training scheme by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan)  in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he can do something about it because this is an area in which the staff of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  have been doing their utmost to create positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750902_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remark was made by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan),  representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extraordinary by any standards, but when it is made by a Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and a Labor Party Minister at that, one has to look for a deeper significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer to what was stated by the previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he quoted from a Treasury minute in the year 1971-72. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has cut down on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> so as not to add to the level of the unemployed, and for doing that we are criticised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I place on record my appreciation of the wonderful work done by the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, in introducing the RED scheme and for taking such a wonderful, personal interest as he did in following the progress of the various schemes in the country districts especially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comment of the previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, was that he would resign if his Government ever allowed the registered unemployed to reach 250 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable Clyde Cameron, introduced this measure it was meant to provide jobs for unemployed people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take this opportunity to thank the previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, on the marvellous way in which he operated this RED scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A senior female officer of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Melbourne, chosen to sit on the committee solely because of her own standing and background -  was convened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth pointing out that the previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  espoused the principle of indexation but he also insisted on including a plateau principle which, if implemented, would have totally destroyed all wage relativities presently in use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again the sad fact is that the last 3 years have shown quite conclusively that the key which opened the Pandora’s Box of our present problems was the decision taken early in 1973 by the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, supported by Cabinet, to intervene in the national wage case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750904_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and for the information of honourable members, I present the first annual report of the National Training Council for the year ended 3 1 December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That was the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A little while ago there were reports that the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was about to introduce amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to protect the public interest, to give the Government power to appeal against decisions of single members of the Commission and to require commissioners to observe the indexation principles and guidelines of the Full Bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> 12 months ago said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>say once again, as I have said in previous debates in this House, particularly this year, that we should really be looking at the 2 sets of figures that are available for unemployment, paying much greater attention to the figure from the Bureau of Statistics than we do to the figures from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which are collected through the Commonwealth Employment Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am staggered that the honourable members from Tasmania should sit so still and silent in this place and not try to at least get the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  to do something about the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to that the Government has established offices of the Department of Social Security, offices of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, welfare offices and community centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me assure the honourable gentlemen that within a week consultations were held- quiet, constructive consultations, I might add, without the issuance of Press statements and the grabbing of headlineswith the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the work of these men a community health service has been provided, an office of the Department of Social Security has been established, new roads have been put in to service the area- I will deal with the Old Beach Road at a later stage and will tell the House just what did occur in regard to that road- grants have been made to the Clarence Council, an office of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been set up as well as Social Welfare offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750909_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has received a projected estimate from his Department that the raw actual unemployment figures at the end of December will be in the vicinity of 400 000, that is after making allowance for the influx of 250 000 school leavers into the labour force at about that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> moving amendments to clause 3 of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill during the consideration in committee of the whole of an amendment requested by the Senate to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will recall, the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, introduced the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill into the House during the autumn sittings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time, the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  has had under consideration various reports and submissions made by industry interests over the years on future arrangements for the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  would agree that we cannot allow the present system to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  in another place knows, because he has been very competently operating in Senate committees himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am authorised by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  to say that if the honourable member wishes it the Minister will be happy to have consultation with him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister and I would meet with the honourable member together with representatives from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to consider this and any other matters he wishes to raise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is trying to make a great deal of political capital out of the fact that substantial unemployment exists at present and that unemployment is likely to increase, in original and not seasonally adjusted figures, as has been outlined by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable gentleman had listened yesterday to his senior colleague, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland),  he would have heard that Minister say that unemployment in this country is now set for a peak which will be around 400 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a look at the Budget speech by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland),  a member of your own Party, delivered in the Senate last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government members are alleged to be concerned about unemployment But we have the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Senate talking about a rise in unemployment peaking at around about 400 000 people by December or January of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-27-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has taken the suggestion aboard but I hope that in the not too distant future the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will turn his attention to this possibility and that his Department will take the opportunity to use this wool store, which is lying empty, to try to provide worthwhile employment opportunity and training for many of the young people who, because they have no trade, will have to drift into Redfern or elsewhere in Sydney away from their own environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, it is true that I arranged for copies of the Platform to be sent to senior officers in the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, however, believed by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the introduction of schemes, such as the National Employment and Training scheme and the Regional Employment Development scheme and the general manpower planning schemes which were developed by the previous Minister, have encouraged persons to use the Commonwealth Employment Service more regularly for the purpose of obtaining employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recognises the deficiency in the Commonwealth Employment Service figures, and that Department has strongly urged the Australian Bureau of Statistics to undertake its employment survey on a monthly basis rather than on the present irregular basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does he agree that there is a wide discrepancy between his answer and the statement made in the House yesterday by the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who said that the Government learned only last week that the unemployment figure would reach 400 000 in January? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer first of all to a question that was answered on 19 May by the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today in this House a question was asked by the honourable member for Gellibrand of the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan),  representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, which was almost word for word the question asked by the honourable member for Gellibrand on 19 May of the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want first of all to quote from Hansard of 9 September a question that was asked by  Senator Everett  of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the same trickery that was indulged in by the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I want to do now is to quote from the document which is put out monthly by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, titled ‘Monthly Review of the Employment Situation ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am extremely upset about on this occasion, as I was on 19 May when the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> gave almost the same answer to a question asked by the same honourable member, is that Parliament was not told of the unpublished lists that the Commonwealth Employment Service held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document that is prepared by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> month after month makes quite clear those who claimed when registering that they were unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for some time now have been consistently asking the Australian Bureau of Statistics to undertake a monthly survey of employment because they, like I, recognise the deficiency in the present figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, nor I, are guilty of attempting to mislead this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member says that some have been rejected, I will certainly raise the matter with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and provide him with a suitable answer at the earliest possible opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan)  is distracted by the problems of the Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> portfolio which he handles in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was explained that, prior to the migrant education function being transferred to my Department, the Migrant Action Committee had sought funds for the salary of a full-time coordinator for its home-tutoring program from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and subsequently the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and that the request has not been approved as such an appointment would normally be made to the State Department of Education as part of the co-ordinated home tutor scheme rather than to an organisation operating independently of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750930_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-53-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the increased assistance for apprentices as advertised in a brochure issued by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not decrying their importance but I am yet to hear any member of the National Country Party rise to his feet and take an interest in technical education, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or social welfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751001_reps_29_hor96/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister will have seen statements made by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> following, and presumably based on, the Government’s Budget to the effect that unemployment will reach 400 000 and that inflation could reach 35 per cent next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Government and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> at the time stated that the amount would be flexible and dependent on the unemployment situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were: The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Cameron;  the Treasurer,  Dr Cairns;  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Mr Uren;  the Minister for Social Security,  Mr Hayden;  the Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Senator James  McClelland; the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Stewart;  and the Minister for Environment,  Dr Cass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s stand, as reported in the  Australian,  was that Australia would not allow refugees to settle in this country unless they could meet normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not an unusual stand to take but I believe the position must not be looked at in any harsh, illiberal or rigid way because in many cases for humanitarian reasons those normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> standards and requirements must be flexibly administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at that time if a person could convince the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities that he was fleeing from communism he was OK. All he had to say was ‘I hate communism’ and that was nearly a passport to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximately 3 weeks ago the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  made a public statement which gave cause for grave concern among the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the figure of those unemployed reaches 400 000 as predicted by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  the pay-out for benefits will be enormous, and the administration of the Department made more difficult, due to these increased numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have written many letters on this matter to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  pointing out individual schemes within my electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-33">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not held discussions on the matter referred to with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but as Minister responsible for migrant education I recognise the arguments for increasing foreign language content not only in school libraries but in public and regional libraries generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-40-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> lifted its estimate of the number of unemployed next year from 400 000 to 450 000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has estimated that the actual unemployment figures- not the seasonally adjusted figures- in JanuaryFebruary of next year to be of the order of 400 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-There are 2 matters to which I would like to refer specifically in speaking to the estimates of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A letter from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> states:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the present Government ‘s mismanagement of all things connected with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, language instruction is still grossly unsatisfactory, and we all know that understanding of the language is a major factor in job placement; counselling is backward and at present distrusted by those who seek to use it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all remember the disbandment of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the dramatic drop in morale within the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With full-time attention required to keep trade union demands under control, the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  has been no different from his predecessor in apportioning only a fraction of his time to ethnic affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator James  McClelland can offer no more indication of his interest in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> than letting commercial misfits such as Alice Cooper into the country I believe we have yet another example of appalling mismanagement or non-management on the part of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could go on at some length further to document the miserable series of failures which this Government has made in the area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to turn to a few specific examples of this Government’s treatment of ethnic minorities, in the Federal Budget for this year and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Government which has made such a great claim about its concern for minority groups in the community, its determination to be rid of inequalities and its commitment to egalitarianism, the Treasurer’s statements on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> show those worthy principles to be reduced to something less than farcial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In another outburst of miscalculations it showed to ethnic people of this country exactly what its true attitude was, an attitude so cursory and so patronising that the Government Printer had to waste no more than 3 lines on the whole ambit of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not just an insulting reference of only 3 lines; the content of the Treasurer’s remarks on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was as logically incomprehensible as it was short. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who have done their arithmetic on Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> appropriations will find that this 3-lihe move will save the Government $5,665,000 in 1975-76 in a projected Budget deficit of $2.7 billion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These measures, which are designed further to impede the necessary <span class="highlight">immigration</span> flow to Australia, are solely and indisputably a result of the Government’s amateur and totally inept handling of the economy which has resulted, amongst other disasters, in a totally unacceptable level of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stated that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> must be taken away from the present Government’s restricting manpower considerations and placed in a much more broad context of a vital component of the nation’s overall population policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in so many areas the Labor Government’s record in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is abysmal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme was started with a bit of a rush, but by the time we had finished I believe the people who were working on the RED scheme, the staff from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, had learned a lot about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay credit, particularly for the tremendous job done by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to people such as Greg Castles, Kevin Steele and  Mr McKenzie,  all of whom have done a fantastic job in getting this scheme going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have been criticising is not the system or the principles involved as originally laid down by the former Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  but the way in which the Government has carried out those principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to direct my comments this evening to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> aspect of the appropriations for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 26 October last year issued a Press statement on the migration program for 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, having regard to the smaller <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program- 80 000- decided upon by the Government for 1974-75, there would need to be a significant reduction in the approval rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not set out all the details because the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> knows all about that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, on 1 5 September I wrote to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and received a reply, a portion of which I will now quote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I used to receive a number of letters of this type from the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Al Grassby, who said that he was going to do a lot of things, but nothing ever happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, in Division 366, which is the appropriation to which I am speaking, we are being asked to approve a proposed expenditure of $4,884,600 for Overseas Services which are basically related to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to revert to the former situation and if we sought to increase the number of migrants entering Australia to up to 180 000, how would officers of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> be able to cope if they cannot handle the few migrants who are coming to Australia now? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion what I am saying is that in my mind the Government is tackling the problem of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> back to front. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time the Government woke up and realised that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has played a very important role in the advancement of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed that the Government and the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Sentor James McClelland) are not prepared to extend the program to a reasonable limit so that the original suggestion of the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, may be acceded to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise in this debate on the estimates of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to refer to the schemes which have been operated by the Department over the past year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, if the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cutback by this Government were to continue Australia’s population growth would stagnate at the present figure of around 13 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just over 12 months since the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable Clyde Cameron, announced the Whitlam Labor Government’s new restrictions on migrant entry into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this Government’s policies the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been reduced from a peak of 185 000 in 1970 to an anticipated figure this year of approximately 45 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having created, by its tariffs and other policies, the largest pool of unemployment in this country since the Great Depression, the Government somehow believes it can cure the problem, or at least alleviate it, by cutting down on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A vigorous and directed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program could well help re-stimulate the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An expansion of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would immediately lead to increased consumer demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has it failed to establish any connection between reducing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and improving the unemployment situation, but it has placed in jeopardy both our social structure and our long term national development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and now the Minister’s Advisor on Migrant Affairs,  Mr Al  Grassby, has even gone on record as stating that Australia has the capacity to support 100 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the late member for Melbourne, the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, who was a good friend to many in this House, first designed and implemented our post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy we had a population of some 7 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the policy of the present Government towards <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is wrong for a number of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reintroduction of a vigorous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program could do much to revitalise Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call upon the Government to rethink seriously its present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a significant feature of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy under the previous Government, to such and extent that by the time we of the Australian Labor Party came to office in December 1972 some 25 per cent of our annual migrant intake was being lost by wastage of migrants returning to their home countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Realising the need to reverse this trend and to develop a policy of post-arrival and settlement concern, several actions were taken very quickly by the labor Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Al  Grassby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among those valuable initiatives was the decision to appoint a committee of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council to inquire into and report upon the extent of discrimination and exploitation of migrants, with particular emphasis on their use of community resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has presented its interim report to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the Public Service Board to allow officers in Government Departments to undertake full time interpreter courses at full salary and for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to pay allowances made under the National Employment and Training scheme to certain categories of students enrolled in these courses is a positive step forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one reason why NEAT is so maligned and one reason why the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, with the best will in the world, could not cope with the strains and demands placed upon it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make clear that the criticisms which I direct are not at the officers of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but at the Government for making across the board tariff cuts of this magnitude and expecting NEAT to be able to cope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy has changed somewhat from that set out in a ministerial directive of 6 December 1974 when  Mr Clyde  Cameron was the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one reason why we hear stories of one part of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> compensating employees and management for structural adjustment programs consequent upon tariff reforms and another part of the Department training people for jobs which have been rendered redundant because of the tariff reforms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases I have raised them with the present Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and with the previous Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was made clear that increased costs would not be part of the scheme, but even there the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  is looking at particular projects to ensure that substantial justice is done in every case and that there is no undue hardship wherever that can be avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751007_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to a question in relation to the latest unemployment figures that was asked in the Senate by  Senator Everett  on 9 September and answered by  Senator James  McClelland, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  clearly does not care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751008_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People are sent to me from lawyers- halfsmart lawyers, probably in the Liberal Partywith letters of introduction so that they can ask me to make representations to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to have their visas extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet trends in unemployment- confirmed by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)-  indicate that average unemployment will be around 40 per cent higher this year than during 1974-75. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In looking at  Hansard,  it seemed to me that there could be some misunderstanding so I sought further advice on this subject from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a meeting of Ministers administering the Regional Employment Development Scheme on Wednesday, 10 September 1975, consideration was given to the results of a review, undertaken by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, of projects approved after 30 June 1973 and of those approved before that date on which work had not begun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Officers of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> contacted sponsors of all those projects and sought information as to whether work had started or not, and what financial commitments had been incurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At any election for half the Senate, for the whole of the House of Representatives or for the whole of both Houses I have no doubt what the public will think when they are faced with a choice as Treasurer between  Mr Hayden  and  Mr Lynch,  when they are faced with a choice as Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> between  Senator James  McClelland and the honourable member for Corangamite, and for Prime Minister between the present one and the aspirant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely honourable gentlemen opposite have seen <span class="highlight">immigration</span> forms from various countries around the world when they have travelled, as many of them have done and do extensively, where the first name is described as the given name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things are utterly inconsistent because under the present Government’s policy and as far as can be foreseen, unless there is a major change in Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, only about 2 million people will be added to the total population of Australia between now and the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition has some real reservations, and perhaps before replying to our remarks on this measure the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  will reflect that in 1973, when his colleague the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who is now the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  introduced amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it was the intention of the Government then so to amend the Act as to allow it to appoint an unlimited number of judges to the Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751028_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-33-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will have the opportunity now that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  has extended for a week the visa of  Mr Khemlani. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some time ago the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> mentioned that a projection of unemployment for the January period suggested that the maximum level would be about 400 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that it is fair enough to make the comment here that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751029_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee sees merit in a transfer of responsibility for an expanded special work projects scheme from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and has recommended accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transfer of the scheme to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will involve a necessary increase in staff in the Aboriginal employment sections of that Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751030_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The committee consists of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Special Minister of State, the Treasurer and myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee rightly recognises the work that was done by the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, in establishing the trade union training college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Mr Clyde  Cameron was the first Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that this country has had who was prepared to take the practical step of setting up the trade union training college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, took an important step when he set up the trade union training college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, quite a number of undertakings have participated in a voluntary reporting scheme for many years, and have forwarded annual returns to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for consolidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-40-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware that his Government’s spending cutbacks have resulted in the termination of the 12-month course for interpreters and translators at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-By way of preface to my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs I refer to his decision to allow Australian residents who leave Australia on foreign passports to re-enter Australia without re-entry permits after absences of up to 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: In respect of the amnesty for illegal immigrants presently in operation, how many illegal immigrants have come forward as a result of the amnesty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the House to look at what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, as he then was, now Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, said in an interview reported in the  Australian Financial Review  on 2 1 November 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know how many of these people live in our country, but let us accept the figure that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  gave in the House last week of 32 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gullible folk are persuaded to part with their savings under the mistaken belief that, no matter what the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials say, they will gain permanent residency when they get to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was attempting to extort money on the promise that his friend in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department could help the individual to stay in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He called on the new Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to clarify the election promise of amnesty for illegal immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consulted with officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the States and gave them explicit instructions that people applying for amnesty should be treated with the utmost consideration and humanity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Neos Kosmos  accepts the guarantee and asks all illegal immigrants to report to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> without delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously it would make a nonsense of any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After the honourable member put his case- I thought he did so quite properly, quite fairly and quite well- I was then pleased to hear the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  say that he welcomed the discussion because it was non-partisan and it was an endeavour to get to the root of the problem that besets these people in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have great pleasure in supporting the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  because I represent an electorate which contains some 6000 Greek people, 2000 people of Russian extraction, 1000 Italians and 2000 other people of non-British origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me say this to the people of Victoria: When you compare the results of the man who is now the Commissioner for race relations,  Mr Grassby-  a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- when 367 people stepped forward, with the results of the new Liberal Minister you will see that the new Minister has increased the previous number eleven-fold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Melbourne, who is the Opposition’s spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, suggests that the period should be one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Probably the most shameful episode of the period of conservative <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy occurred just before we assumed office in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are difficulties in Lebanon at the present time, as we know, but the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar’ recently issued special instructions for dealing with those difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the greatest difficulties is that our Government will not accept them on normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> terms because they fail to produce a number of documents considered necessary by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been reports that certain trade union organisations as well have said that people who come within the ambit of the amnesty should go to their trade union before they go to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assessment of eligibility under the subsidised health benefits plan and the issue of SHB entitlement certificates are carried out by the Department of Social Security, not the Department of Health, in respect of all these groups with the exception of migrants whose certificates are issued by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760225_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working mothers have managed to maintain momentum behind economic development in this country since the early 1960s when it was discovered that, with the fall-off in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the contraction in birth rates in earlier years, unless working mothers entered the workforce the economic momentum of this country would be set back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760226_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to appear to be a repetitive bore on this topic but now that we have had a change of government once again I want the new Ministry, including my friend and colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is at the table, to be very much aware not only of the aspiration but also of the urgent need of the people of Brisbane to have the airport relocated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those were the words of the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when he introduced a Bill which was aimed at pocketing for the use of the Commonwealth Government funds which rightly belonged to the Australian producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760303_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  said yesterday that both had diplomatic passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister said that the men were met at the airport by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials and issued with documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it was answered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  following a short conversation on the front bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> went on to say: ‘We asked them what they were doing here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On arrival the Primary Officer, Customs, consulted with the Senior <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Officer on duty who gave approval for temporary entry to Australia on the basis that the people concerned were diplomatic or official personnel being formally met by an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust, too, that the Government will consider at an early date the reintroduction of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program somewhat similar to that of a few years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been my belief that in the short term <span class="highlight">immigration</span> may interfere with employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the long term <span class="highlight">immigration</span> creates employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this end we must increase the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on a gradual basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should they have to bear the strain and the sorrow of having members of their closely knit families separated by thousands of miles due to inhumane and narrow <span class="highlight">immigration</span> guidelines for family re-unification? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome, therefore, that section of this Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also welcome those aspects of the Governor-General’s Speech relating to immigrants as being essential to any successful and humane <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and I also urge the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestions in the Henderson report directed at eradicating some of the deficiencies and prejudices which our social welfare system presently contains regarding migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760304_reps_30_hor98/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that had been started a few years earlier by the right honourable Arthur Calwell, a former most distinguished member of this Parliament, had not yet had an opportunity to flow through to strengthen the industrial base in many parts of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most plausible assumption set out in the Borrie Committee report is that the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake will be approximately 50 000 a year and that the replacement rate of natural population will be approximately one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at what is happening in relation to the population growth in Australia at the moment we find that the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake is significantly lower than the 50 000 postulated by Professor Borrie, and the net replacement rate is significantly lower than one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even with a 50 000 net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake and a replacement rate of one, the population of Australia by the year 2000 would be approximately 17.6 million, which is significantly less than the 20 million plus envisaged when the original growth centre concepts were being drawn up and plans were being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I want to analyse 2 aspects with which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  dealt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the previous Government we saw excesses of spending on a multitude of feasibility studies and surveys; we saw a lack of consultation with people who were to be directly affected by growth centre proposals; we saw enormous increases in commitments on land purchases, as was just mentioned by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister  for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who moved the motion mentioned that it arose out of the recommendation of the Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760317_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is the problem which I faced when I was the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One very senior member of the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> decided to give his own wife a NEAT training allowance, and other senior officers of my Department gave relatives and friends NEAT allowances under the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The home building area is a case in point and the Government is carefully monitoring the situation, as witnessed by the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill which was brought in a little while ago by my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760318_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speeches of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  have put forward positively the Government’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During his career here he was Minister for the Army, Minister for the Navy, Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Minister for Health and Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760323_reps_30_hor98/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs a question about the rejection of applications for citizenship on the basis of secret reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable gentleman said, Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of all political persuasions have adopted that practice in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday afternoon the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs suggested that I had stated, during my speech on the matter of public importance, that the Acting  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was not ‘quite up to his job’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, only represents the Minister in another place who is responsible for the former Department of Urban and Regional Development, a portfolio which once had some muscle in the Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs who is sitting at the table and who I presume is listening to this, and listening intensely, will be able to respond to these propositions when he replies at the end of this debate because housing is a very personal matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very pertinent remarks in the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  indicated that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact that is less than the amount provided last year, and in his second reading speech the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  justified that on the basis that the amount was set out in a Labor Budget anyhow and this Government did not feel like increasing it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in his second reading speech touched on the allocations for the first 6 months of 1976-77, but the situation will be quite critical in Queensland after 1 July because of the situation I have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that a number of different programs of migrant education have been developed by various bodies- by the Department of Education in the Commonwealth sphere, by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and by other various State bodies- which do need some coordination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have drawn this to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs because I think it is of concern to him in the ethnic affairs part of his portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The structure of that education centre is as follows- I gather that it is not just limited to Eastbridge and that there is a similar situation existing in other centres: Firstly, the Language Training Supervisor in charge of that centre is employed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most importantly, what action does the Minister or the Government now intend to take to have processed all <span class="highlight">immigration</span> applications from the war-torn country of Lebanon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I informed the House at that time that the Embassy had moved from its official quarters to a hotel in the middle of Beirut and that the persons dealing with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inquiries there were doing so at some considerable risk to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was there any lack of liaison between the Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in regard to notification of the closure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What discussions, if any, were held between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in regard to the closure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, there was no lack of liaison either between myself and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or between my department and his department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision was taken then and my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, was advised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To seek to allege that there are differences between me and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs would just not stand up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In directing my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs I preface it by complimenting him on the assistance I have had from him and his Department in processing applications for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia from Lebanese nationals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to Australia has also declined dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the first report of the National Population Inquiry- page 302- if fertility stabilises at around 1975-76 at net reproduction rate = 1 the population to be expected by the end of the year 2001 would be 15.9 million in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and 17.6 million if net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> averaged 50 000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is currently running at well below 50 000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in the context of the need for long range perspectives on population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that the Liberal-Country Party Government, on the strong recommendation of the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so far as Australia has had a population policy in the post-war period it has been in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rather than policies designed specifically to increase births to achieve desirable population policy goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who suggest that Australians should be encouraged to have more children as a substitute for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, external <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will continue to be the only major instrument available to government to influence the level and composition of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that the rate of population growth in most of our traditional source countries for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is decreasing and, if current trends continue, will do so to a much greater degree from early in the next century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What population goals should <span class="highlight">immigration</span> be directed towards in the medium and long term? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A precedent is the 2 per cent population growth rate policy following the Second World War and the introduction of annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreed policy was that Australia’s population should increase by an average of 2 per cent per annum, approximately 1 per cent resulting from natural increase and the balance from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One only has to consider that since 194S some 3.3 million migrants have come to Australia and that one person in five in this country is a migrant to appreciate the impact of post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost universally agreed that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been of enormous benefit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a larger and more diverse nation than the one which set out on the large-scale post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are groups who see our standard of living rising by upgrading the skills of our work force and developing our natural resources without the assistance of further <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or even population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the community sees some cause for concern in an ageing population, it may even be desirable to direct <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in such a way as deliberately to have a ‘younging’ effect on the populationfor example by lowering the general age eligibility limits or by giving preference to younger applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our example, and even massive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from them, will not have any significant effect on the scale of their problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For its part, the Government maintains its position as stated in its election policy statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is an essential instrument of Australia’s population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those population policies are directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a commitment to population growth, with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as the prime factor in that growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But- and I emphasise this- it is not a commitment to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> simply to add to our population without any assessment of the effects of doing so and what is needed to meet those effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that Australia’s population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> strategies must not be a numbers game but must have a sound basis which takes account of the medium and longer term implications of various growth options. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my capacity as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs with responsibility for matters of population policy, I now announce initiatives which will assist the development of future population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, I have reconstituted the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council which was originally established in February 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reconstituted Council will advise me on such matters as regular monitoring of, and research into, population change; major developments and research in Australia and overseas concerning population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>; the longer term implications of changing patterns of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes; ways in which future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes can be planned to complement other policies; and implications of population change for various aspects of resource allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the new Council indicate the importance which the Government attaches to population policies and show its determination to base <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and programs on a range of considerations, inclusing the population objectives to be developed with the assistance of the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall be asking APIC to proceed with preparation of a Green Paper on population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking account of the problems of comparing statistical series and the different time periods, it is apparent that the high levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Canada during the past 3 years have not had a significant effect on the level of unemployment On the other hand, Australia has sharply reduced <span class="highlight">immigration</span> during a period of rapidly increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canada has sought to achieve a consistent approach to population growth and to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of consistency in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs is a most important matter for us all to consider. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the great question of creating new job opportunities in the emerging post- industrial society, though there is evidence that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> itself helps to create jobs and to generate economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-29-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member omitted to say that the first statement which the Minister made in January was in fact the result of a review which was initiated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he was the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that partly explains why he was removed from his office as Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to another position in the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could mention the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the war service homes people and quite a few others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was Minister for Labour and later Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I publicly expressed great concern about the activities of some people, a very small number of unemployed, who were voluntarily unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been much better for the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, as it then was, to be the only department administering unemployment benefits, with its decisions being binding on people in receipt of unemployment benefits or seeking them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can certainly speak for myself and say that I would not have accepted them had I remained Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> instances occurred in Melbourne and in Sydney in which in isolated cases one person was drawing unemployment benefits in as many as 7 different names. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the present Government on having divided the administration within the Public Service of the former Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, ending an amalgamation instituted by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this particular instance there was a request by the honourable member for Shortland calling upon the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to table the document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put the question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: ‘Did you read from the document?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In past decades of high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and rapid industrial development, there was a general presumption that all foreign investment should be welcomed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The senior Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer remained in Beirut until the Embassy staff was withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Locally engaged staff, except for one or two people who endangered their own lives were unable to reach the hotel in which the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer was operating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was virtually impossible for those in the Lebanese community who may have sought to reach the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already given instructions that an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer of the former Beirut staff, who is now in Athens, should proceed immediately to Damascus to process those people who would be eligible to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as the situation in Beirut stabilises to the point where the Embassy staff can return and operations can begin again, a task force of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers will be sent into Beirut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Brogan, the Senior Migration Officer who was in charge of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Office in Beirut, is now in Athens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been directed to co-ordinate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> arrangements for those Lebanese who reach countries outside the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have details of a case that was submitted to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760401_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we learnt that lesson the hard way by the disastrous efforts of the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760406_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is all the difference in the world in giving a Minister a right to answer a particular matter, such as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who may speak on the matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which is raised in the debate, and in providing for a Minister a period of 10 minutes in which to put on a political tirade against the Opposition or against someone else which normally would have been part of the adjournment debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore welcome this ministerial statement by the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar),  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, on home savings grants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must comment, therefore, in this debate on the initiative which was undertaken by the FraserAnthony Government soon after December of last year to decrease interest rates by 1 per cent This decision, taken with the whole package announced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, gives positive proof that we are concerned about the housing needs of the Australian people and that we totally oppose the philosophy of the Labor administration which said that the Australian people would have to get used to the idea of living in smaller homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Last week the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  acting on behalf of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood)  announced the intention of the Government to amend the home savings grant scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and I are in close touch on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-At the outset I would like to say on behalf of Opposition members that we welcome the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on this very important matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that the ensuing debate at least will lead to consideration of vital questions of policy in the future and will lead, to some degree, to solutions to the problems which we will have to face in the short term and the long term in relation to population policy, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and community affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also says that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> also has declined dramatically in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we must ask is whether the fertility and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> slow-down is temporary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is <span class="highlight">immigration</span> more limited at the present time than it has been in the past? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we did accept the assumption of the Minister- I suggest at this point that the assumption is still very questionable indeed- that fertility rates are declining and will continue inevitably to decline and that the major way in which the Government can affect the composition of Australia’s population is through regulating the level and composition of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, a whole series of other factors needs to be taken into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the rationale that the Minister presents in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is one largely of turning the tap on when we need them and turning the tap off when the economic circumstances do not permit their ready integration into the workforce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since <span class="highlight">immigration</span> levels are determined largely by government decision, predictions must be based on political forethought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s capability of managing various levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in relation to overall population size to date has largely been determined by political economy factors, particularly the capacity of many industrialists to seek cheaper labour and bigger markets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, on page 9 of his statement stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, it may be true that there was a national consensus in 1945 upon <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for those purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, one of the major characteristics of Australia in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is its highly industrialised nature and the roles that immigrants are expected to play within the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When traditional British and Western European sources of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have declined Australia has had to recruit migrants from countries or areas within countries- for example, rural Greece and Yugoslavia- without the background, education and industrialisation necessary to produce well-trained manpower. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of this <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, sustained and continued by the Liberal and National Country Parties for something like 20 years, of the distribution of ethnic groups is very much now mirrored in terms of their distribution within occupations and the class nature of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the 1950s and the beginning of the wave of southern European immigrationfirst it was the Italians and then later the Greeks- migrants have disproportionately entered the unskilled and semi-skilled manufacturing and construction jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> labour has provided a significant and growing proportion of the workforce and almost all Australian industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would have been a decline in numbers working in manufacturing by some 20 per cent in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to a study undertaken in September 1 975 by what was then called the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> entitled ‘Migrants in the Work Force’, the major occupation group in which migrants are employed is the broad and statistically unsatisfactory group of ‘tradesman, production process workers, labourers, etc’ which together contain 45 per cent of migrant workers compared with 29 per cent of Australian born workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so far as community tensions are concerned, the Minister contends that it is universally agreed that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been of enormous benefit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the rationale for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his ministerial statement the Minister suggested that the Government should maintain its position as stated in a policy statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> being an instrument of Australia’s population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those national policies are directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a commitment to population growth with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a prime factor in that growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that need should be one of the most important factors when embarking upon any further <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to make some comments very shortly about the structure of the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council which has been restructured in the terms outlined by the Minister in his statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to have <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs we should have <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs that strive for respect, equity and fairness for the individual and that reflect as far as possible respect for and the diversity of values and life styles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me pay a little attention to the structure of the newly formed Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council, to which I have made reference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs suggests that it is to be bipartisan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the underlying themes, indeed the main underlying theme, in this statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760408_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has moved that the House take note of the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is not a member of the economic committee of Cabinet, has pleaded that money is involved and that therefore the Government, 6 months after it was installed in office, cannot make a commitment to growth centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had an important advocate for their cause right inside the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760505_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the question that ought to be answered by the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Ellicott)  or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before I outline the ways in which the cuts have had this effect, it is worth noting the views of the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs when the Racial Discrimination Act was debated on 8 April 1975 and he was speaking for the then Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760506_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the House that in the absence of  Senator the  Honourable Ivor Greenwood, Q.C., the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Honourable M. J. R. MacKellar, Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, will act for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have hoped that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, would have fought for more reasonable proposals, even though this matter is not directly under his administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in theory when a government wants to start a new program or wants to spend more money on defence, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or whatever it may be, it has to go out and defend that proposition before the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760518_reps_30_hor99/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently- in October 1975- the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> requested the  Chairman  of the Stevedoring Industry Council,  Mr R.  Northrop, Q.C., as he was then, to review the attitudes of groups having an interest in the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, Foreign Affairs staff overseas and in the States who spent more than SO per cent of their time working on aid functions, plus staff from the Departments of Education and Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who were similarly occupied, were progressively taken over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760519_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-24-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government acknowledges the favourable impact which <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has had on Australia’s economic and cultural development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistent with this view the Government has decided on a target of 70 000 persons for the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for 1976-77, compared with the estimated intake of 50 000 in 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760520_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I direct my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs also concerns Lebanese coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason that the statistics are not included is that the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in the Lebanon, in Beirut at that stage, were working under extreme difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760525_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Along with the miniBudget we have had mini policy statements from various Ministers including the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like the contribution by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch),  the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is another exercise in faulty logic and woolly thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs says that he will allow employers to recruit a limited number of unskilled workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is anything that can be guaranteed to bring out into the open this racism, it would be an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that increased the competition for already scarce jobs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Does he intend actively to recruit suitable persons to fill these gaps, or will the Government continue its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> administration simply by taking skilled workers if, and only if, these persons offer themselves? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is vital that we base our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy on the long term projections rather than the temporary day to day fluctuations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is happening under this Government is that while the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is increasing the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, so creating a greater need for these support services, the Treasurer is hell-bent on dismantling the same services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what sort of logic is it that increases the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake and at the same time reduces the quality and quantity of the services available once these people have arrived in our country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to make only one last point about the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and that is to draw attention to the impression that the new Minister has given that he is intent on returning to the traditional sources of migrants for this country, in other words the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760526_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That easy-visa-system was set aside by the previous but one Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- he was then the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameronand when we came to office we decided that the only way to overcome the situation of a large number of people residing illegally in Australia was to declare an amnesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just before I was sacked as Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I was working on a regulation that would allow substituted service for logs of claims so that unions could make claims that were more realistic, by servicing, say, the association of the employers concerned only and that copies of the log of claims could then be published in the Government  Gazette. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760527_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister, in association with child welfare authorities, is concerned to do whatever is possible within her powers to facilitate the adoption of the many children such as these and in fact already has signed some 90 orders which have the effect, by exempting the children from the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Guardianship of Children) Act, and hence the guardianship of the Minister, of permitting the due legal processes in the States or Territories to determine whether adoption applications may be approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has the responsibility for determining the eligibility of people for residence in Australia, including a child whose admission is sought by Australian residents for the purpose of adoption in Australia, or an immigrant child being adopted overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since 1952, by agreement with the State and Territory authorities, those powers and functions of guardianship of the Federal Minister for Social Security under the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Guardianship of Children) Act, have been delegated to the principal officers of the relevant State and Territory child welfare authorities excepting the power of delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760528_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee also recommended that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, as it then was, should take over the scheme, that an Aboriginal employment section should be established in that Department, that the Public Service Board, Government departments and instrumentalities should actively recruit Aboriginals for employment and training and create as necessary special training positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760603_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He will recall the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in another place making absurd forecasts of levels of unemployment which were not helpful or conducive to a dialogue at the time and which were seen subsequently on the record to be subject to utter and complete inaccuracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760819_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  sometimes waxes indignant about an illegal immigrant; but his words are always in terms of disobedience to the Act, without any regard to any mitigating circumstances that may be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware that many Lebanese refugees who have had their visas approved in Australia have been stranded for months in conditions of extreme economic and emotional hardship in cities all over the world and are unable to have their papers processed by our overseas officials? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has compounded the joke by asking the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to think up ways of spending the $50,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now either the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or the Minister for Social Security wants to get rid of a lynch-pin in the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to direct the attention of the House, as I have directed, by way of a letter, the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  to one of the problems for migrants in the Geelong area which has resulted from the amalgamation of the former Department of Labor and the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the separation of those departments since the change of Government last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the amalgamation of the departments following the 1974 election, officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> serviced the Geelong area on a regular basis- I think for 5 half days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that some 22 per cent of the population of the area is of migrant origin and a very heavy work load for the migrant communities has been undertaken by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the amalgamation of the 2 departments, the officer who had been carrying out the duties of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the area was absorbed into the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and, as part of that Department’s Commonwealth Employment Service in Geelong, still carried out the same duties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Department has become a separate entity the officer concerned has remained with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and on an agency basis has carried out those functions previously carried out for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in its single and combined functions with the Department of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the officers concerned find it unsatisfactory, and I believe that the reestablishment of an office or regular visits by an officer of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is highly desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760907_reps_30_hor100/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The survey of unemployed young people conducted in September last year by the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> revealed that these people were predominantly the less educationally qualified, the low-skilled and the inexperienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, not having a great deal of success, trying through the Central Office and, still not having any success, trying through the office of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to give a couple of examples of events which I think demonstrate either a lack of administrative ability in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or a lack of sympathy for and understanding of those people who have had to flee their own country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like this gentleman in Geelong, the brother in the Lebanon is also an Australian citizen and therefore there are no problems in respect of entry or <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but, unfortunately, he is crippled and unable to travel alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously she would prefer permanent residence for herself, as would her 2 brothers, both of whom would be resident in Australia, but she has been refused temporary or permanent residence by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on the ground that if she comes to Australia as a temporary resident she may seek to stay and that would constitute a future embarrassment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that in this instance the strict interpretation of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> guidelines should not necessarily be applied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is time that consistency was observed in this type of operation where the strictest interpretations of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> criteria are being applied to people who are in tragic circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At present more than 8000 Lebanese in Cyprus where Australia’s Lebanese <span class="highlight">immigration</span> operation has been concentrated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A senior officer of my Department with wide <span class="highlight">immigration</span> experience in Australia and overseas was sent to Nicosia last weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has extensive terms of reference to report on the most effective way in which the Lebanese <span class="highlight">immigration</span> operation can be organised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officers did stay there and did process applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760909_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Negotiations between the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs and Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> commence immediately on the transfer of responsibility for the Special Work Projects Scheme to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  replied to me the same evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned at the time that the Australian Government, and I in particular as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, would keep a close watch on the unfolding events in the Lebanon and would respond to them as they occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Government took a decision to maintain a watching brief over this Middle East situation, and when the quasi refugee buildup was such that something extra needed to be done the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, with the co-operation of the Syrian Government and also the Royal Netherlands Government, placed an officer in Damascus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that consideration the presence of Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials in Nicosia was strengthened, exactly in line with the actions of a number of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, my first responsibility is to the Australian population, the Australian society, the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the investigation of offences against laws administered by the Department and of organised circumvention of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and procedures; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the establishment and development of procedures for the prevention and detection of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> malpractice; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760914_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was clearly an unsatisfactory situation and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of the day, the Honourable B. M. Snedden, with the full approval of all State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, established in 1969 the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications under the chairmanship of  Dr David  Myers, Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It thus complements the work of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is well aware of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of situation was considered in May 1976 by a conference of Australian State and Territory social welfare administrators which recommended that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should be reviewed for children subject to foreign adoption orders to allow entry only of those who have been subject to orders likely to be recognised by an Australian Court; who have been subject to orders considered unlikely to be recognised in Australia but where the adopting parents have been approved as suitable to adopt by the adoption authorities in their State or Territory of normal residence; or who have had a child-parent relationship of long standing and where refusal of entry of the child would not promote his or her welfare and best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethic Affairs, my role is primarily to determine applications for entry to Australia of children for adoption on the basis of the principles and recommendations I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet in December 1 974 the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Cameron,  announced in a Press statement a program of relocation assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760915_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs a question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760916_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I direct a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and refer to the problem of illegal entry into Australia by persons who have not obtained proper entry visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will remember that earlier this year the steamer  Australis  was the vessel from which some 54 people decamped and sought to evade normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should make it clear that Indian nationals are not the only people involved in efforts to circumvent Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, arises from the continuing losses of life and property from earthquakes in the Friuli region of Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-28-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed that in this House the other day the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  referred to the difficulties of adoptions arranged overseas and the need to have those adoptions recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-38-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amount will be determined in consultation amongst the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, myself and the Treasurer, before going to Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the elected Cabinet agrees on those recommendations- it is that elected Ministry which must have the final say- those plans about growth rates must be converted into energy needs, manpower needs, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs and education needs in order to make decisions on what should be the key industries, decisions on the protection of full employment in this country and decisions in many other related areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760922_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> criteria were relaxed for Lebanese who had suffered hardship as a result of the conflict within the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The task force will remain in Cyprus for 3 months and the special <span class="highlight">immigration</span> operation in Nicosia will then be reviewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- Ordinarily the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would have been followed by a statement from my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  who is the spokesman for the Australian Labor <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Party on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there must be a very heavy load on the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister in processing the hundreds of applications that honourable members make on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I speak at this stage because I hope that before we come to the debate on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs the week after next it may be possible to clear up some matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already given instructions that an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer of the former Beirut staff, who is now in Athens, should proceed immediately to Damascus to process those people who would be eligible to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760923_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To process the application requires the establishment of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team, including medical personnel, to travel to the camps and to assess the people on the spot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not possible to deal with the nominations received from people in Australia as one would deal with a normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> sponsorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my intention to address my remarks to the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we have a program under which we intend to increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> this year to 70 000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the policy of the present Government yet it talks about increasing <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that during the 23 years from 1949 the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake continued at a rate around 2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average growth rate for those 23 years of Liberal-National Country Party Government was something like 1.1 per cent in natural population and 0.8 per cent in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that under the conservative forces of this country, between 1949 and 1972, 70 per cent of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> increase in the population of this country settled in the cities and urban communities of Sydney and Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That proposition is still put forward by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He not only supports a proposition for an increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program but also he supports a program of increased natural birth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By making a rational decision in relation to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program we would then be able to look at a population of something like 17.5 million by the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to this country should be allowed on the basis of family reunions and from such countries as Lebanon and Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset I refer to the statement on population policy made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in the House on 30 March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had hoped to speak in that debate in order to call for an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, but the debate was terminated rather abruptly and this was not possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Arthur  Calwell commenced the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme Australia’s population was approximately 7 million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> reached a peak in 1970 when 185 325 permanent residents came to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over half the increase of 6.2 million in Australia’s population since World War II has been due directly to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This view has again achieved some prominence in recent times, and I believe it represents a grave misunderstanding of the effects of a high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I cannot but question how the Minister can reconcile that view with the present restrictive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> guidelines and an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target for the forthcoming year of only 70 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Canadian experience has shown that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has had little or no effect on unemployment in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Canada during the past 3 years have not significantly affected the level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, migration to Australia has declined so drastically that the rate of increase in our population has come to a virtual standstill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister further pointed out that the rate of growth of our traditional source countries for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is decreasing, and that, if current trends continue, it will do so to a much greater degree from early in the next century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not a day passes without people coming to my office, wishing to sponsor close friends and relations for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must pay a tribute to the present Minister who, of all the Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> with whom I have dealt in the last 1 0 years, has given the most compassionate and sympathetic ear to family reunions and applications by people to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day may well come when the United Nations, dominated by Third World powers and the communist bloc, may endeavour to dictate to us what our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should Uke to address myself to some of the more basic questions on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in this country from a long-term point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to criticise some of the opponents of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are basically the same people who opposed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ever since it became fashionable to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that is ever since the time <span class="highlight">immigration</span> started. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same people, who are still opponents in most cases, now argue the opposite- namely that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will cause unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether this is still done by the present Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, but the old Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise with pleasure to speak to the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately it came to office it established a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect the Government’s record is first class and the record of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is excellent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not 2-faced about our policies, and I believe that the migrant community of Australia and all Australian citizens recognise the real concern that this Government and the Minister and my colleagues on this side of the Chamber have for the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In rising to speak to these estimates, I was concerned to deal firstly with the estimates for ethnic affairs provided for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would establish a Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and that the migrant integration services being performed in the Department of Social Security would be transferred to the new Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one area that comes within the responsibility of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Office has been shifted from the responsibility of the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  to the responsibility of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members have spoken about the effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on unemployment and about the priorities of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  made a particularly useful contribution to the whole question of the morality of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be very little doubt that the great majority of the members of ethnic communities are very much concerned about the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that this Government is now about to undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he is developing proposals for which he does have some direct ministerial responsibility, such as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> plans, he should have some care to take these factors into account. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking again at the Minister’s responsibilities directly for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, it would be mealy-mouthed to speak in a debate such as this without drawing attention to the very real concern felt about the performance of his Department in several significant areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that in times past no great demands were made on the abilities of the officers in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to respond quickly on difficult policy decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-At the outset, in supporting the appropriations for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I would like to compliment the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on administering a very difficult portfolio in a most - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  who has just resumed his seat said how important <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is to his electorate and to the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he does this because he has no concern, as is the case with the majority of Opposition members, for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and its impact on the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying before the honourable member for Chifley so rudely interrupted, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is to be complimented, as is his Department, for handling at a most difficult time some very difficult matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has conceded that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department have, to a large degree, given sympathetic consideration to the handling of applications from those Lebanese nationals desirous of coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, under the capable administration of the Minister, has sought to process as quickly as possible and in a most compassionate way, every application that has come forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under his Government’s Administration illegal residents in this country were too frightened to come forward and submit themselves to the examination of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs which would consider whether they would be fit and proper residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did split <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into its real area of concern- <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this debate on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I direct attention, as I did last <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reveals a failure by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to come clean with the many hundreds, indeed thousands, of Lebanese residents in Australia who are trying to assist their relatives overseas, most of whom have suffered enormous emotional and material hardship and loss. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement to the House on 1 April, following the closing of our Embassy in Beirut, the Minister pointed out that there were Australian missions in Athens, Nicosia, Tel Aviv, Ankara and Cairo and that special arrangements were being made to post an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer in Damascus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In support of his claim that Australia had done more than any other country to assist Lebanese wishing to migrate, the Minister cited, among other things, the presence in Damascus of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer he had referred to in his ministerial statement on 1 April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 2 1 May the Minister issued a statement announcing that Australian residents can now sponsor the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of their parents even if the parents are not dependent on them and are outside the acceptable occupational categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise to speak in support of the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs which this year provide for an expenditure of $32,975,000 compared with an actual expenditure of $27,130,458 in the last financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  announced that following consultation with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations a revised list of occupations for persons eligible for migrant entry into Australia had been approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I could be critical of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, it is in the area in which relatives want to migrate to this country from England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to see what can be done to speed up <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia in these cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs represent a very significant expenditure on a very large proportion of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise this matter because I want to refer to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  the reported remarks of  Mr Justice  Gibbs in the High Court to the effect that amnesty should have been granted to this gentleman, an Italian journalist whose deportation the Minister has ordered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the amalgamation of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> with the former Department of Labour the services of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer were regularly available in Geelong on, I think, five half-days a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a lot of work in the Geelong area for an officer of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and I hope the Minister will consider restoring that service to the migrant community of that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is another matter I ought to raise while we are dealing with the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> restrictions there are large numbers of migrants who have raised <span class="highlight">immigration</span> queries relating directly to members of their families who may or may not, in the final analysis, qualify for entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that an extension of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that any relaxation in our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should be along these lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within our community we are beginning to get more detailed consideration of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>- it has been exemplified by statements tonight- not just in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but in terms of the broader context of a population policy for Australia and that is what we are seeking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very pleased that a number of honourable members referred in this debate this evening to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> not just in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for itself but in terms of a broader policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a gross over-simplificatoin of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for this current financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore he can only be arguing with that section of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake which is related to occupationally selected migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the people who will be competing with Australians for jobs in terms of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake fall largely within the family reunion category and humanitarian category both those sectors of the intake which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said we must continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke in the longer term about an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe bis contribution was part of the series of contributions which related <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to population policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he and other honourable members will know we are seeking through the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council to have a green paper prepared and ready for public consumption early next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hopeful that honourable members and interested people within the public who have a commitment in this area and who have some strong feelings in relation to these matters will make their contributions to the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, successive governments in Australia in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy have set aside the policies pursued by other governments- that is the guest worker concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  in his contribution said that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was a misnomer because it did not have any ethnic affairs function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other comment I would make in relation to the speech made by the honourable member for Grayndler is in respect of his suggestion in a Press statement he put out earlier this year that there was something racist about the Government’s attitude towards <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to state publicly that I have nothing but praise for the commitment, hard work and dedication of all members of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs both in Australia and overseas for the way they are handling the very greatly increased work load. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, I am very pleased that at least some of the contributors to the debate in relation to the estimates for my Department took the opportunity to draw <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the wider context of population policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the very reason that I went to see the work of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the offices of the High Commission in Nicosia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761005_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs who is responsible for administering the Racial Discrimination Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I address a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that leads to that sort of situation is shocking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more disturbing than that is the comment that the fall in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has dried up the traditional source of labour for the farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the contractors said that stepping up the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the only way in which to provide enough workers for the market gardeners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975-76 $10m was spent on child migrant education under the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act 1971 in the six months period to 31 December 1975; from January 1976, however, the child migrant education program has been financed from general recurrent grants administered by the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council survey showed that 66 per cent of Greek migrants cited the English language as the biggest problem they faced; 55 per cent of Yugoslavs said that it was their biggest problem, whilst a recent survey of Italian migrants claimed that it worried them also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week I asked a question of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Government generally that they have proved to be extemely good migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the statement of 23 September 1976 concerning the Government’s review of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy relating to persons normally resident in Lebanon, all members of the family are now eligible for migrant entry subject to their completion of normal health and character requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761012_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-17-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 1 November, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the elected Government,  Senator James  McClelland, announced that government sponsored students from Vietnam and Cambodia were eligible for resident status whether or not they had completed their studies- a significant departure from previous practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it did not do the Leader of the Opposition any credit to use the descriptions that he did in regard to the policies pursued by this Government or to the way in which I, as the Minister, have administered the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761013_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Government closed our Embassy in Beirut on 28 March and on 1 April the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  issued a statement in which he made the point that Australian missions existed in Cairo, Athens, Nicosia, Ankara and Tel Aviv and that special arrangements were being made to post an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer in Damascus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can assure this House that beneath the comforting veneer of Press reports emanating from the Minister’s office is a reality of serious and continuing bungling on the part of the Fraser Government, particularly the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that stage the fighting was escalating in Lebanon and the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> staff in Beirut was reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member has mentioned already the temporary establishment of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office in Damascus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In late June advice was received from the Syrian authorities that it would not be possible to extend our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> activities in Syria beyond the end of June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clearly, the question of Australian diplomatic representation in Syria must be resolved on the basis of a wider range of issues rather than the need just to maintain a shortterm <span class="highlight">immigration</span> operation, and that an operation to process applications from people outside Syria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Lebanese diplomatic representatives in Australia and the Australian-Lebanese Association have been in close contact throughout the crisis in Lebanon and many measures have been taken to assist the plight of the Lebanese who have been unable to flee Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The criteria for entry into Australia has been extended on compassionate grounds and additional staff added to existing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices surrounding Lebanon and a special <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office has been established in Damascus with the sole purpose of assisting the Lebanese who have fled to Syria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department and its officers are working under most difficult and extreme conditions and are dealing with people who have been subjected to considerable shock and stress and there is no doubt that there are some cases of hardship that are still being encountered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Until the last 3 or 4 minutes of the speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  I thought that he was approaching this topic in the way it should have been approached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member’s main charge against the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is that the Minister could not foresee whether peace or truce would exist between the Christians on the one side and the Palestinians and the Syrians on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761014_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the House on 23 March the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the incorporation of ethnic radio into the Australian Broadcasting Commission, an organisation already reeling under the indiscriminate savagery of this mean-minded penny-pinching Treasurer, the individual who determines not only the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs but also the policy of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs maintained in this House on 16 September, that some 250 submissions from individuals and ethnic groups were received, but the Minister completely begged the question when he went on to state that these submissions with very few exceptions recommended that ethnic radio be funded by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is to the credit of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and he also advocated this alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on 16 September guaranteed that ethnic communities would be given access to the programming and direction the programs should take. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We decided- it was a joint discussion and a joint decision by my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  and I- that we believed it was in the best interests of Australians and of the ethnic communities generally if we set up a separate unit within the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761019_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware of the Press reports of 13 October on page 1 of  La Fiamma,  an Italian language newspaper, relating to the socalled  Handbook of Hate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761021_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was by far the smallest intake in the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761102_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  ignored the requirements of this legislation when he decided to proceed with an enlarged <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for this financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761109_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761110_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Report of the Committee of Economic Inquiry in 1965, the Vernon Report, pointed out that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was a more costly source of skill than training additional craftsmen in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Training points out that although <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been a valuable source of skilled labour in the past it is not clear that intakes have always been sufficiently closely related to labour market needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761111_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: Is it true that the extended criteria for entry into Australia by relatives of residents of this country will cease to apply at the end of 1976 and that any applications not completely processed at that date will be considered only on the basis of the previous restricted criteria? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That projection was based on a net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> gain of 50 000 people per annum and an assumed continuation of the presently low level of fertility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean)  might have imagined it was an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> debate for all the interest he was taking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The level of acting duty prevailing in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs results from the need to retain vacant positions in Canberra and State Branches into which officers returning from service overseas can be absorbed at their substantive classifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reducing establishments overseas and in Australia and the structural rearrangements which have taken place affecting <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> functions and staffing over recent years, have also been contributing factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has no mandate to so describe a person or a class of persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Did the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration recommend in general terms that where the principal interest for Australian representation in a foreign country was the responsibility of a department other than the Department of Foreign Affairs, such as trade or <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, that the Australian Ambassador or High Commissioner should be appointed from that department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761118_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-61-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would include officers not only from the Department of Foreign Affairs but also officials from the Department of Overseas Trade and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs among other Australian officials posted overseas for the purpose of pursuing the interests of Australia in those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, it agreed that the Departments of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security should draw up a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the Australian Greek Welfare Society setting out the basis of the provision of services by the Society for and on behalf of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle in relation to this and as such I have instructed the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council to include a chapter on refugees in its Green Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761202_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sub-Committee on the Middle East of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has now reported that its  Chairman,  the honourable member for Fremantle, wrote on 24 August to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to the effect that there are strong humanitarian reasons for the re-establishment of a reasonably sized <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team in Damascus and that he wrote on 1 October to the Foreign Minister concerning diplomatic representation in Damascus and aid to Lebanese refugees in Syria and Cyprus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask: What progress has been made in establishing an Australian embassy in Damascus in order to reinstate facilities for processing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> applications from persons fleeing from the Lebanon? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to the opening of the post in Damascus, which is the thrust of the question so far as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should a decision be taken to reopen that post, following the report that I receive from  Mr Starey,  the officer who was left in charge of Beirut, we will of course expedite the entry of Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> personnel, and the diplomatic officials would follow later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the control of ethnic radio has been the subject of an empire building feud between the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is widely known that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs met the  Chairman  of the ABC and other senior ABC executives in mid-October when the Minister’s gentle overtures were deftly and subtly rebuffed by  Sir Henry,  particularly on the matter of the appointment of a national ethnic broadcasting council to advise the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is probably not the appropriate authority as it is presently constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department is almost exclusively a Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and has little to do with ethnic affairs as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast with this 40- strong branch in the Department of Social Security, the ‘ethnic affairs’ unit of the so-called Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs consists of a letterhead and about three or four officers rushing around getting in each other’s way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this really a ploy to take migrant welfare out of that Department without the Minister’s knowledge, so that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, with its four or five relevant officers, can establish a monopoly over ethnic affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a course of action would serve further to confuse migrants and the Public Service as to just who is responsible for ethnic affairs in this countrySocial Security or <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar),  who represents the Minister for Social Security in this place, could enlighten us one of these days instead of leading migrants up the garden path and placing them in a situation where they have to rely on a letterhead and four or five officers to look after their needs in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr E. G. Whitlam Asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-86-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1 969 at most posts locally engaged staff were controlled by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and it was a relatively simply task to provide an up-to-date report on numbers employed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-86-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to receive monthly returns of staff employed at its posts, these reflect total numbers employed without any split-up into staff employed on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or other specific activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-86-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also quite clear that the labour force is not as docile as it was when this country was implementing massive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-13-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>51 <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers visited premises occupied by the Children of God on 29 November 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-23-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The visits were carried out as a routine <span class="highlight">immigration</span> activity by officers in the normal course of their duties and no separate costing is therefore available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-23-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>141 persons were spoken to, of whom approximately 70 were interviewed to a greater or lesser extent concerning their <span class="highlight">immigration</span> status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770215_reps_30_hor103_c1/#subdebate-23-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Dr Wilenski  ‘s appointment as permanent head of the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was attacked on the grounds that he is a member of the Labor Party and worked as my Principal Private Secretary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is a question that really should be directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770223_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have been asked to accept questions on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who I think is still ill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> powers enable the Minister to deal appropriately with any such cases which come to notice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here I draw attention to an answer I was given on 28 May last by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  giving the number of certificates of citizenship granted in excess of 100 in the various local government areas in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that proprietors of fish and chip shops, among others, are having great difficulty in obtaining unskilled workers and that these proprietors are being disadvantaged by the present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of excluding such likely workers coming from overseas on the grounds that such workers are still available in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think the question I answered, I answered on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, who was then ill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer it to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been through periods of rapid expansion in our industrial and manufacturing capacity, of rapid population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> growth, of stock market booms, of unprecedented minerals and resource discoveries and of significant recognition by the world community and, in particular, by many of our Asian neighbours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must require more capital intensive industries in the future, and the only prospect of changing the trend would appear to be the reintroduction of a much more positive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy combined with family development policies to encourage more, young people to have larger families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to suggest that if the Labor Party had remained in office for another 2 years and had had its full 3-year term of office from May 1974 to May 1977, the words of  Senator James  McClelland, when he was Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, would have been brought to absolute truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770309_reps_30_hor104/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hundreds of the hopeless can be seen milling around the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office where our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers do their best to cope with the mess that this Government has created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to refer to one thing that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  did last year which was not necessarily wrong in principle but which was disastrous in the effect that it has had in our handling of the Lebanese refugee situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of what the Minister did was a flood of Lebanese into Cyprus and other places which aggravated in particular the situation in Cyprus and made the task of overworked <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers even more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are now arrangements for people to go back to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office in Nicosia as late as 3 April this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is absolutely necessary that even now the Government reinforce the staff of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> post at Nicosia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was at Nicosia just a fortnight or so ago, literally hundreds of people were nulling around the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office, standing there like cattle, and being processed at a rate that was deplorable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government set up <span class="highlight">immigration</span> committees to deal with category A applicants alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These refugees should not be allowed to languish on Cyprus or anywhere else because Australia is too niggardly to send more <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers or more medical officers to Nicosia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  the spokesman for the Opposition on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs, has once again brought the plight of Lebanese people to the attention of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep in mind that any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, and particularly any program in relation to refugee or quasi-refugee resettlement, must take into account the full global situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not making any complaints about the efforts that have been made by officers in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs whether here or overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give credit, as the honourable member for Melbourne did, to the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs both locally and overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is to be congratulated for the very close attention he has given to this matter in the past year or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look at the letter tabled in this House today by the honourable member for Melbourne who is the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It left us with no <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy properly referrable to refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah-Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs)- The honourable member for Lang  (Mr Stewart)  raised the case of the sister of a group of people who was alleged to have been told that she would not be allowed to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in an expression worthy of his Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  ‘the full global situation’ of persons of quasi refugee status- that is about as dehumanising a phrase as I can think of- talked about the selectivity of the Australian Labor Party when it was in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has had any dealings with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and with the distressing situation of relatives in Australia knows that people who go to Cyprus stay there and month after month are told to report back again and again to the High Commissioner there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter which the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  tabled points up one of the demands of the Lebanese community in Melbourne, that there ought to be additional interpreter staff within the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs available to assist sponsors in this country who are concerned about their relatives in the Lebanon or who have escaped from the Lebanon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Canberra and its regional offices, at least to my knowledge in Sydney, has been much less than adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that my relatively less well-off constituents have no difficulty in telephoning Nicosia daily to hear reports of their relatives’ applications but the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Australia is forever losing files and unable to be brought up to date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speech of the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  was what I would describe, again in colloquial terms, as a lead balloon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I suggest that by innuendo he accepts that the Government and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  have done a very fine job indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer was located in Damascus in April and action was taken to strengthen <span class="highlight">immigration</span> representation in Cyprus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May 1976-1 am going through the historyspecial staffing arrangements were made at Australian posts in Athens, Nicosia, Cairo and Ankara and an Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer was attached to the staff of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Damascus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In June, the Government decided that a more rapid service could be given to Lebanese applicants by transferring the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer in Damascus to the Australian High Commission in Nicosia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In September 1976 the Minister announced that a senior officer would be sent to Nicosia to report on the most effective way in which Lebanese <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia could be organised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and his Department might have a further look at this matter and that the former  President  of Lebanon be allowed to visit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  may assist us in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ridiculous, almost to the point of suicidal folly, for us to be thinking in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs when we are literally paying abortionists to slaughter potential population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770310_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has drawn attention to the fact that his colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  will be making a statement on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia clearly enunciated its goal to achieve through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> an annual population growth of 1 per cent to supplement natural increase which was also expected to be about 1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established the goal, it set out to achieve it through a vigorously promoted, but selective, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not to say that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs during the past 3 decades have not been accompanied by problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is an increase in the birth rate, we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and, in the absence of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> gain, Australia will experience zero population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the experience of several developed nations suggests that Australia could even be facing further falls in its birth rate and a future loss of population in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over recent years, we have also seen a rapid rundown in the rate of population growth through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents a growth rate for the financial year of less than 0.15 per cent through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> options open to Australia, we must bear in mind that Australians themselves are a mobile people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to avoid regular losses of such needed skills, it is imperative that Australia should maintain some level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which is selective in regard to occupational skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This component of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program would also appear indispensable unless its underlying humanitarian objectives are to be jettisoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This element also, I believe, should be a necessary part of any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and I hope to announce soon the policy guidelines within which Australia’s future responses to such situations will be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Green Paper indicates, issues underlying <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cover a diverse range of topics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of an annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, the Green Paper suggests that feasible limits might be net gain in the range of zero to 100 000 persons per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>High tribute is due to the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council which has prepared this Green Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to pay particular tribute to the part played by the late J. F. Rich who died 2 days after the Green Paper was adopted by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now 30 years since the great post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was begun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was introduced by a consensus of people of vision, people confident about the future of Australia, a growing Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have noticed an increasing public debate in relation to the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members know, last week I tabled in this House a Green Paper on Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see, from page 16 of the Green Paper on Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and population tabled last Thursday, that the annual increase in the labour force for 1976 was somewhere between 100 000 and 115 000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now 7 years since the McMahon Government commissioned the National Population Inquiry and a little over 12 months since the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  announced that the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council would prepare a Green Paper to stimulate public debate about Australia’s population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indicative of this policy, the Government’s inefficient and  ad  /deprocedures in determining <span class="highlight">immigration</span> quotas are a perfect example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies are vital issues of concern to every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is appropriate that in this period of record unemployment and deepening economic recession we reassess our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and the options for the growth and development of Australia’s population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament and the public might have expected the Minister’s statement to reflect the importance and magnitude of the issues involved, an analysis of Australia’s past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, some assessment of the recommendations of the National Population Inquiry, a guide to the major issues identified by the Green Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recurrent theme in the statement is the relationship between economic growth and the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister attempts to imply that Australia’s future prosperity depends on high levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> comparable with those of the post-war period being maintained for the next 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, and our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies substantially assisted and promoted this development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, shortages of labour would have resulted from this reduced recruitment to the work force and would have restrained Australia’s economic growth in the post-war period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee of Economic Inquiry chaired by  Dr J.  Vernon reported in 1965 that one of the major costs of Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy was the diversion of capital from investment to improved industrial productivity, to the provision of roads, houses, schools and other services for our increased population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vernon report also noted that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> tended to raise the level of imports in the medium term without appreciably raising exports and leads to overcrowding and environmental deterioration of the cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading “The Effect of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on Populations’ the Green Paper stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as in Australia, the Canadians have realised that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> exercises a pervasive influence on the whole of the political and cultural evolution of the national life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equated with a previous Australian slogan of ‘Populate or Perish’ are a whole series of earlier arguments in favour of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which are familiar to Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canadian Green Paper is scathing in referring to the view that the competitiveness of Canadian industry would benefit from a larger domestic market, a major factor in post war <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and one on which much of the 1966 immigraton policies were based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bureau predicts that even without <span class="highlight">immigration</span> the age group IS to 19, from which most of the new entrants to the work force are drawn, will exceed the level of present years peaking in 1978 and again in 1988. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact there is every reason to believe that an increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program would aggravate Australia’s unemployment problem in the short term, particularly amongst the young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Vernon inquiry noted that if a shortage of labour leads to an increase in the total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program this would be a more costly source of skill than to train the additional labour in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For too long Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, particularly the recruitment of skilled labour, has been a substitute for technical education programs designed to train and utilise Australian labour more effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His statement quite deliberately attempted to create the impression that Australia faces negative population growth in the short term and a decline in total population in the absence of a substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is an increase in the birth rate, we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and, in the absence of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> gain, Australia will experience zero population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Past high levels of fertility and the input into the population of many thousands of young adults through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have produced an age structure with high proportions in the young child-bearing ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having been denied these justifications for a high rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the Minister returned to the empty continent syndrome and implied that we must utilise our superabundant natural resources or have them taken from us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Australia adopts a high intake <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in the future it will stand alone amongst the industrialised nations with which we usually compare ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A series of Canadian Green Papers also questioned the value and impact of significant levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New Zealand inquiry went on to count the cost of increased population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and their impact on the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and the nation must carefully consider this overwhelming body of overseas evidence that suggests that Australia should carefully re-assess its past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs before extending them to our pop11lation policy for the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again wish to commend the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council for its work in preparing this Green Paper, but I also intend to offer what I hope will be viewed as constructive criticism of the structure and functioning of the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our population policies will determine the nature of Australian society in the year 2000 just as our past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs have changed Australia over the last 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before any informed decision can be made about Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies the Government and the Parliament must be supplied with accurate population statistics and with adequate and up-to-date information about our present demographic patterns and the distribution of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is absolutely essential and a vital prerequisite before an objective, intelligent approach can be made to population policy in general and particularly <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances this population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> statement is a very important one, but it is also a little distorted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be understood that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is part of a population policy; <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not the totality of a population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet as I look through this Green Paper I see that 1 per cent of it is devoted to a consideration of population policy and 99 per cent is devoted to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect I believe in the words and in the philosophy, which were enunciated so well after World War II, that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a very valuable addition to the Australian population; it ought not to be a substitute for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We acknowledge immediately that they might do these things purely for economic reasons, but the simple facts are that in at least four of the countries of eastern Europe which were beset with very great population problems and to which <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not allowed their birth rates have increased substantially over the last 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that I am saying is that I hope the Government as part of its consideration of a population <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy does not put those considerations and countries aside altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> part of the program, the trotting out of the old argument that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> itself causes inflation or causes a decrease in capital stock, that kind of argument was taken care of, defeated and put aside at the Premiers’ Conferences in the early 1950s- in 1953, 1954 and 1955. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also clear from the document that the committee looks at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> not as a short term measure but as one which continues for decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I finish where I began and I say that in consideration of a population policy I hope the Government remembers- and I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would have it on his mind as always- that population consists of 2 ingredients: The excessive number of births over deaths and the net settler arrival figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed surprise that a Green Paper entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population’ should spend so much time dealing with the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the Australian context, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> remains the major instrument by which government can directly and significantly influence population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, makes one wonder about their validity in considering them  vis a vis  <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s post Second World War <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy under Caldwell was based partly on humanitarian grounds and partly on the growth of Australian population that was needed at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was very little in the way of social planning programs to accompany that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of some of those measures which must be considered in looking at an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and a population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sorry; I am now informed that he is the private assistant to the Victorian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The speech of the honourable member for Scullin, however, was in sharp contradistinction to the speech made by the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the Green Paper on Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the shadow Minister will well remember the work which was done by the Labor Party on the migration system in Australiathe work of rapidly cutting back the number of migrants, the work of dispersing the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and tying up some of its loose ends in a  pot-pourri  known as the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper refers to the nexus between the rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the rate of capital investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the Green Paper and summing up what people in my electorate think about <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, I would say the total net effect of this vacuum, which has been largely created in the Australian Labor Party term of office, is absolutely detrimental to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper, on summing up, in my view basically supports <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a tool of population increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It says that we will have an increase in demand for services with an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that was self-evident but there are many people, such as the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who seem to thinkthis is one thing I vaguely got out of his speechthat an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will necessarily add to the rate of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think that it is self-evident that an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will add to the demand for services and then ultimately of course to the supply of services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It talks about the possibility in future programs of the deployment of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for the purposes of decentralisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that the issues of capital investment were mentionedwhether in fact an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will cause a fall off in capital investment available for production as against that which will be required for the provision of social services such as schools and hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It also notes that there should be no bar to continued <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from nonEnglish speaking countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another thing I heard the Opposition spokesman say was that perhaps we do not have the resources to sustain a tremendous increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are traditional arguments against a substantial increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programthe traditional argument of an increase in the unemployment level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is talking about carrying out a very detailed study through the Commonwealth Employment Service of the unemployment situation among the migrant population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must give the late Arthur Calwell credit for his foresight after the war in getting this country going by means of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has added a great deal to this country and will continue to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that because of the popular Press it may be politically unpalatable to talk about an increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will stand out on any limb and say that the long term results will bear out any sort of confidence that the Minister might have in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program adding to this country once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program will help us to take advantage of that unlimited future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that one of the most important decisions of the leaders of this country was to have a great and substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>II was based on humanitarian grounds and the needs of the country and that later <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under Liberal governments became factory fodder programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment there is an extremely constrictive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which was initiated under a Labor government and which has been carried on, I think in almost equal effect, by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is most likely that the cost of importing tradesmen, especially with the uncertainties of recognition which exist- I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would understand that as well as I do- would be greater than the cost of training the tradesmen within our own instrumentalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is to step up the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in order to bring about a net gain of say 30 000 or 70 000 persons a year, it has to be prepared to do something that governments have not done in the past, that is, to provide the wherewithall in order to finance an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program at the increased rate which it determines the program should reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not heard anyone suggest that we are going to increase the size of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for any reason other than a selfish reason, that the program would benefit us- not them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>State Departments of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> go through some form of mystical process of screening migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After they have been screened and the sponsors in Australia feel that they have arrived at a situation where approval will be granted, they begin the process through which other migrants go in the normal sense by being rescreened by the Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We talk about the success of the early <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are an important source of migrants to Australia and have provided a substantial proportion of the postwar <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is fanto say that the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was the start of migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making- I think it should be made quite strongly- is that we should not be starting an increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program merely because this would be seen to be some way of stimulating our economy or stimulating growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be starting an increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, if that is our desire, purely for selfish reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing which was a feature of earlier <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs was that we welcomed the males and left the females where they were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if the consequence of an increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> flow is that more people are settled on the fringes of the 2 major capital cities of Australia the program, while it might be temporarily satisfactory as a stimulant, will be regressive in its total concept because of the consequences on those capital cities which are already in a situation of turmoil because of their population and lack of social fabric. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Green Paper entitled  <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that when there has been adequate public debate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  might ensure that there is another debate in this place on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been prepared by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council whose membership is far ranging. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, because of the present difficult economic and employment situation in Australia, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs have been decreased significantly to a point where the 52 748 migrants arriving in 1975-76 represented the lowest intake since 1947 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is a country whose population is based on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that in looking at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population policies one must involve oneself in an examination of the unemployment question in Australia todaywhether the unemployment is long-term or whether it is short-term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also makes the point in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in Britain and refers to an anti-<span class="highlight">immigration</span> backlash in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But looking at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies in the future one would have to be very careful about how such policies were handled in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has brought to Australia a number of things that we would not otherwise have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  shakes his head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was making the point to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that the question of skilled labour needs far greater research in Australia than has already been undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it seemed that the Green Paper was taken up with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and perhaps submerged the total question of population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the figure given in the Green Paper relating to the fertility rate is correct and there is no gain at all in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> we will have a very low population by the year 2000 compared with what we may have anticipated 10 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of any stepping up of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program on the basis of family reunions this will necessarily mean that because most migrant families live in Melbourne or Sydney there will be an increase in the population in those 2 cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It must have come as a great surprise to this House to learn that this Green Paper was the first that had been presented to the House in its history on the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, I think, noticeable that of all things <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been the most bipartisan matter before this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sure, the great <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program of the recent decade was carried out under the aegis of a <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  very rightly pointed out that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was only one of the ways in which the population was increased and the optimum reached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be changed by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has tailed off and it is no longer significantly contributing to the increase in our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is, of course, a matter of individual people besides being a matter of total population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is reason why Australia should grow and there is reason, therefore, to have an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of a quite different order of magnitude from that which we have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 per cent natural growth and 0.8 per cent <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me examine the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population which is before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and to the House that if a comparison were made between that report and the reports and the studies that have been made in Canada, United States, the United Kingdom and other parts of the world it would be found to be in fact an extremely poor report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Borrie yardstick we can expect a population of approximately 16 million people by the end of the century if we rely only on natural growth and exclude <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crucial question for policy making is whether we accept that target figure and adjust our policies to it or whether we accept 16 million people as a base which can be increased quite substantially by a deliberate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of allowing in up to 20 million or even more new migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heavy <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs impose immediate burdens on resource allocation and can cause gross distortions in our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That 1.1 per cent would include both natural growth and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The natural growth would need to be supplemented by a modest <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know also that there has been strong population growth in Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, in South Australia, even without a major <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program these trends will continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could be no more fundamental matter for debate at this point of time than the question of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in bringing the Green Paper before this Parliament pointed to the fact that this was the first green paper dealing with Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population ever to be tabled in this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity of congratulating the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on the initiative and drive that he has shown, aided and supported by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council, in preparing this Green Paper and bringing it before this Parliament and the people of Australia for discussion and debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said before and I shall say again, that this Government is fortunate to have a Minister of the calibre of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who has ventured to express some views on Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies may I be heard to say on this occasion that this Minister is one who does give one a hearing and is responsive and sympathetic to the submissions one puts before him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is incredible when one considers that with a population of 13.9 million in one of the richest countries in the world, that this is the very first time that there has been a Green Paper on this matter placed before this Parliament for the Parliament as a whole to debate, giving it an opportunity to consider Australia’s future population growth and in particular <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister said when he introduced the Green Paper into the Parliament, the previous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which has operated in this country for nearly 30 years was responsible for bringing to Australia over 3.3 million new settlers who, together with their children born in Australia subsequent to their arrival, have been responsible for about half of Australia’s postwar growth from 7.4 million to 13.9 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to take note of some of the comments which have emanated from the other side of the House we would have no <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some who are frankly so petrified at the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, thinking in some way it is an electoral issue which could put them out of Parliament, that they are not prepared to face up to the realities and the challenge that is before Australia at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Minister and the members of APIC for coming out and telling the Australian people quite bluntly that we can expect a considerable increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australiamuch larger than many other people would have believed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable speakers who have preceded me have pointed to the fact that increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> leading to increased population will lead to increased demand and increased productivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Far from endangering the jobs of Australians I believe it will make available to Australians more jobs than they would have if there were in fact a negative <span class="highlight">immigration</span> growth in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unless there is an increase in the birth rate we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and in the absence of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> gain Australia will experience zero population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the experience of several developed nations suggests that Australia could even be facing further falls in its birth rate and a future loss of population in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the Minister I draw to the attention of the House that unless we have a proper <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy not only will we have reached the situation of zero population growth but we will find that this country in the 1980s- that is barely 3 to 4 years off- will have a very severe manpower shortage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I just say in passing that I welcome the indication that we might now be talking in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in net terms rather than raw figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that the Minister makes, the point that the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council makes- and on APIC were the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,  Mr Hawke,  and the Secretary of the ACTU,  Mr Souter-  is that if we do not get these people into Australia we will not be going anywhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The establishment of a small, permanent team of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in Bangkok is one proposal I put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight we are talking on the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a very serious matter to contemplate because we can now be laying a basis for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that can last Australia for the next 30 years or so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party is proud of the fact that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was one of its creations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that on this occasion, as has been the case on many other occasions, a tribute can be paid to the architect of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program- the late Arthur Calwell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard this acknowledged even by Government supporters and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is indicating that mention was made of this tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After Labor initiated this program- and a former colleague of mine, the previous member for Parkes,  Mr Leslie  Haylen went round the world in a difficult situation gathering up the ships to bring these people to Australia- we found that a unity ticket evolved on the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intake from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has slowed down as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was proper that the intake from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should slow down in that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years we had a <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target of one per cent of the population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 our net loss in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was 8000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told in the Green Paper from the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council that in 10 years we lost 330 000 people who took up residence overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent that there is a very real relationship between the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> figure and the state of buoyancy of the Australian economy, the availability of jobs, the availability of houses and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to look at the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake and to see from where our migrants came. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, in cooperation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  should be giving much deeper thought to the need to lift from 14 per cent the intake of Asian migrants and should have regard to the need to bring people from Oceania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would take the lower of those 2 figures if I were having a stab at the kind of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake that we should have at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the net effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would be beneficial to Australia in that it would have the capacity to increase consumer demand in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me mention that the population trend in Australia is very serious in that we have had a decline from the stand point of both natural and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has the effect of offsetting this declining fertility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think sufficient figures are available already to indicate that if Australia is to sustain its population and if it is to provide the population expansion which is necessary from many points of view, including the point of view of defence and point of view of getting effective utilisation of our generously endowed resources, it ought to be at this stage laying the basis for an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which will contribute to the well being of this nation, to the growth of our economy and to the prosperity of the Australian Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-26-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Briefly I want to raise a matter which concerns the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  and to some extent the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been seeking to lay the basis, through consideration of a Green Paper, for an on-going <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am further informed that late last year, following the High Court decision, the Attorney-General approved the drafting of regulations under section 1 1 1 subject to consultations with my Department and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The consultations with my Department have concluded, and those with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will, I understand, be completed very shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770322_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-31-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When these were being ironed out by the then Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Honourable Clyde Cameron, he was, as the House will recall, unceremoniously removed by his Leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This of course was understandable as the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population was due to be tabled and debated in this House, as it was yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had intended to participate in that debate as I am particularly concerned about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, but this was not possible as the debate in this House was curtailed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population will stimulate throughout the community dialogue and debate regarding the quantity and quality of Australia’s migrant intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an excellent paper and no doubt the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  will be submitting to Cabinet in the not too distant future a report based on its findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that if <span class="highlight">immigration</span> were stopped completely the country would be unable to replace the skills of the 30 000 to 40 000 Australians who leave the country each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This figure dwindled to only 50 000 in 1975 under the Labor Government’s restrictive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> guide lines- the lowest figure since post-war migration commenced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In actual fact there was a net loss in 1975 of more than 6000, perhaps almost 8000, in the number of people entering and leaving the country- the first net loss since our present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program commenced in 1946. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Former Liberal and Country Party governments had set a goal of at least a 2 per cent annual population growth rate- 1 per cent through natural birth and 1 per cent through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it would in Australia’s best interests if the Government were immediately to increase the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target from 70 000 to 100 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we are being horribly short sighted- not only the Labor Government before us but even the present Government, even though it has expanded migration- in restricting our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to such an extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, following the publishing of the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population, the Government will review our whole migration program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with a number of remarks he had to say regarding <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My electorate has a large migrant population and problems are often placed before me which are forwarded on to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770323_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to a few matters that really go to the point of the failure of the Government to keep its promises, firstly, in the area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs which is the area of my responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in stating a policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population, is laying the groundwork for bringing more migrants into this country, the Government cannot take adequate care of the people in the country at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though times have changed drastically, with hundreds of thousands of people out of work, there has been no change of which I am aware in the Government’s commitment to large scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever may be its strange attitudes to future <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, or even to the future of Australia, the Government is demonstrably at fault in its attitudes to existing communities of people born overseas and the children of parents born overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and of the Government to ensure that proper and adequate facilities are provided for the purpose of protecting those people who are brought out here in the first instance as factory fodder and then forced into a situation where they are at the mercy of the scavengers in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a far more difficult <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problem than normal migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770324_reps_30_hor104/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>Once the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has this matter well in hand we will be able to get down to obtaining a literal interpretation of what is an evacuee and what is a refugee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In referring to this passage, I am not necessarily putting the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the same category as that well known character, Shylock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s Green Paper and the Borrie report tend to suggest that the major input in the future will be from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased that we should continue our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program provided it brings in people who are compatible with the work force, who can work, who can contribute to our society or people who ought to be admitted on humanitarian grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must stimulate proper <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, namely, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that is compatible with our economic requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the short time remaining I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who has produced a totally new approach to the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Debates on questions of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> always worry me because for many years we of course accepted the proposition that we had to populate or perish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I wonder on what grounds the assumption is made that the standard of living of the community has been raised specifically by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when one comes to weigh up the advantages to Australia one should not be too glib about assuming that all the advances, or an enormous proportion of the advances in our standard of well-being, have been due to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  during his remarks on 30 March last year and again recently made some other observations on which I would like to comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the arguments put forward in this whole <span class="highlight">immigration</span> argument is that we need the migrants because that is the only way to get young people to help to support the old people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a lot of people, and yet the Government is still talking about <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has not the Soviet Union honoured the Helsinki Pact with reference to freedom of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In Australia <span class="highlight">immigration</span> must surely form a very important part of any Government’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake over the past few years has diminished considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt whatever that when this situation is arrested the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is doing an excellent job, and the Government will ensure that increased migration takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this discussion much has been said about the Green Paper entitled  <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population  which was tabled in the House recently by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the estimated net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rate in the current financial year is little more than 30 000 people, compared with only 21 000 people in 1975-76. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It all adds up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with little or no natural increase in population and only a very small net gain from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in previous statements in this House has made it clear that there is a numerical decline in what has historically been the mainstay of the labour force, the male worker; and the risk that we shall become increasingly inward looking and a stagnant society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s real population building took place in the post-war period when we embarked on a major <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a move to increase the number of  refugees entering Australia and details of this are due to be announced shortly in Canberra by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I deal very quickly with some of the pretentious nonsense often regurgitated by all sides in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reference to factory fodder is used by anti-<span class="highlight">immigration</span> people and is supposed to end all discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Broken Hill Company, General MotorsHolden’s, the Ford Motor Company and others supported <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the basis of obtaining unskilled labour as well as consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to criticise more specifically some of the opponents of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are basically the same people who opposed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ever since it became fashionable to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that ever since large scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span> started its opponents have argued that in periods of full employment the cost of basic services required for migrants- the so-called build-up of a social infrastructure- was so great as to use up our very limited resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such people in most cases are still opponents of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and now argue the opposite, namely, that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will cause unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before discussing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, I would first like to address myself to the findings of the first report of the National Population Inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Population Inquiry highlights some quite startling facts which I believe must provide the basis for future government planning, not only in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but in almost all areas of government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the case, one should think very carefully before accepting the necessity for high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, this has strong implications for future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result and in the absence of any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program a continued decline in fertility rates in my opinion will lead us not only to zero population growth but even further to negative rates of population growth in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, Australia’s governments in future will have to look increasingly to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs to maintain reasonable rates of population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree wholeheartedly with the comment by the honourable member for Lilley that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be seen as a very valuable addition to the Australian population but not as a substitute for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that any initiatives to redress that imbalance would take a long while to implement, quite clearly there will be a case for a much higher <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake in the years to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in view of the predicted decline in the rate of natural growth to Australia’s population, on balance I support the view that higher <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates are required for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, we need to consider such an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in terms of Australia’s economic structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake is undertaken together with some restructuring of domestic industries in order to allow the laws of comparative advantage to take effect, such a program is well justified and is in the best interests of both Australia and our trading partners in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second qualification I have relates to the rate of increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> levels should be sufficiently flexible to take account of Australia’s short term domestic economic problems, our manpower needs and our changing capacity to absorb immigrants after giving full examination to the social consequences of large, constant intakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But having made those qualifications, on balance and for the reasons I have already stated, I would support the need for a substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for Australia for the foreseeable future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main functions of Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in the past has been to increase the labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, coupled with declining fertility rates, Australia will become an ageing nation and it is suggested that within, say, one generation the total proportion of the population dependent on those of working age will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the need for Australia to increase its rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> over the longer term primarily because we had a humanitarian obligation to the poorer nations to develop our richly endowed country for their benefit and also for our longer term benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the arguments I have advanced for increasing our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program over the longer term, I submit that this Government and all future Australian Governments have an obligation to ensure that we amend the present social and economic structure of Australia so that those women who wish to raise a family are no longer penalised or discriminated against as compared with the typical 2-income families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In concluding my remarks I congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for the way in which he has handled his portfolio in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population should remind us all that we should be taking more notice of population trends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preface of this Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population indicates that the size, composition and distribution of our population will have a major influence on the nature of our future society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we close our minds and eyes to the problems of the pressing necessity of a large part of the undeveloped world- much of it a starving world- we will no doubt shelve our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problem with probably the excuse that because we have a high percentage of unemployed we cannot allow more migrants to enter the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is at the present rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that that is the only consideration that should be taken into account when we are looking at altering our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that speakers from both sides of the House do not appear to be advocating an all-out <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should make it known that we reject the proposition that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can be used to solve economic difficulties or that it should provide an underpinning of unskilled labour to be hired or fired at the whim of an industry, whether in a time of full employment or in a time of high unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with these principles, a moderate level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be proposed with special consideration given to parents and dependants of former settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should always be balanced with these considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is the second major component of population growth and it is here that the rate of growth should be regulated to allow the maximum welfare of the present community and those who make their homes here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other speakers have claimed that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cannot be turned on and off but it seems to me that the facts of life would indicate that we cannot leave the gates wide open irrespective of how much we would like to admit people from the developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should support an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy administered with - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to take part in this debate on the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate and much of the discussion is looking ahead not to next year, not even to the next decade, but to the next century because the policies that we implement with regard to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and, putting it in a wider context, with regard to Australia’s population, will determine the manner of the future development of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At.the outset, I want to stress that I think Australia needs increasingly to see its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy as a part of its population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result, the major influence on Australia’s population will be our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when we read in the Green Paper that a series of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> options have been put forward, I think that we should rephrase the term ‘<span class="highlight">immigration</span> options’ and refer to ‘population options ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point I want to make at this stage is that over the past few years we have looked at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs upon the basis of the number of new settler arrivals and we have said that there will be 100 000 new settlers coming to Australia in a particular year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the settler arrival figures give a totally false impression of our current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Net migration, rather than gross settler arrivals, is used in measuring population growth due to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, as it takes account of departures from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was stopped, population growth in Australia would be determined by natural increase (i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  when he looks at this question to recognise that family reunion is based upon humanitarian grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet there is a certain illogical position for those vehement critics of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> who see the stimulatory effects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> during inflation but fail to admit the potential for recovery from recession in the same source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times it was changed from <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that consideration should be given to changing the title to Minister for Population, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to draw attention to the significance of migration in terms of Australia’s total population program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think we can show that an increasing area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will create more unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the moment I am not inclined to come down on the side of those people who say that we ought to reduce <span class="highlight">immigration</span> simply on the grounds that it increases competition for jobs, though probably not on very good logical grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome this debate tonight in the hope that people will continue to look at the subject of migration in its constructive aspects and learn from the last 30 years the lessons we should apply to a continuing flow of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a way <span class="highlight">immigration</span> produces a different kind of Australia for us all to live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In entering a debate on Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and population it strikes me as rather odd that the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  who preceded me in this debate, spent all his time talking about Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I do think that the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  during his time both as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the first Whitlam Government and now as Commissioner for Community Relations, has devoted a good deal of time and attention to a lot of the problems which are canvassed in this Green Paper that we are discussing tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to talk about the human face of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst people have commented from time to time on the way in which certain programs have administered by the Government and on certain directions that the Government is now seeking to take, basically we have been talking in largely theoretical terms about directions of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not like to see a word like ‘etcetera’ in reports like this; it is fairly sloppy-  is so poor that consideration should seriously be given to stopping or at least reducing non-English-speaking <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in commending the Council for its production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fairly significant that this is the first Green Paper on Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and population ever presented in the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to think about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in relation to employment or unemployment, population, demographic distribution and a whole host of other things, but this is the first time it has brought these aspects together in a single document where the language is, I believe, easily understood and where the length of the document is not so great as to deter people from reading it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a significant feature of earlier times that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of previous governments were conducted largely in a bipartisan fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, in my view, that situation changed in recent years but hopefully the debate today has restored some of the objectivity and some of the bipartisan nature of previous approaches towards <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a common feature has been the understanding, realisation and expression of support for the marked changes which have occurred in Australia particularly as a result of the consistent large scale post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The change consists of a pronounced slowing of natural increase and low net and gross <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under present circumstances, taking into account the fertility patterns which are emerging in Australia, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is likely to be the only controllable variable in the population growth rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the evidence that is before us at the moment the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> variable is the only controllable variable that is available to governments in terms of population policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to this an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> variable is significant in terms of placement of people as well as numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The labour force growth rate most likely will decline even with a medium <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By a medium <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, I am talking about a net gain of SO 000 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would obviously be too long a task to go through the contributions of each  speaker  but I note in passing that the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  who is the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, attacked the proposition that Australia should look to higher population rates and attacked the proposition that we should be looking at net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates of approximately 50 000 per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, very few honourable members who took part in this debate suggested that we should not continue with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program or that we should not look to a greater population in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will be even more successful if it brings about in the community at large a better understanding of the background to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy development and as a result of the increased knowledge of that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy development, a series of submissions to the Government which will reflect community views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that reflection of community views, the Government will be placed in a much better position to development <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies which will be acceptable to the nation as a whole and which will bring about the development of Australia, not just in the short term but, most importantly, in the medium and long term, of a size and of a nature which we would all support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first report from the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council produced evidence which requires a total reappraisal of the plans for the future development of our major cities, of growth centres and of population distribution and redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will recall that in 1970 the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Phillip  Lynch, made an announcement regarding a number of steps that were to be taken by the then Government, amongst which was the commissioning of Professor J. R. Wilson of the University of Sydney to undertake - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was commissioned to undertake a costbenefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report has been sought by successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member asks his own colleagues who held the position of Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> he will find that they sought to have the report finalised and brought forward for consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On attaining the office of Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs I too sought the finalisation of the report, and I am pleased to say that I have been partially successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and Australia’s population tabled by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 17 March stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A total of $169,200 has been allocated for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> information activities in the United Kingdom in 1 976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770420_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-28-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> inform the House why the unemployment figures compiled by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> from its Commonwealth Employment Service records are substantially in excess of those produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics through its quarterly labour force survey? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware that a large number of migrants to Australia of recent years have brothers, sisters and children over 18 years of age who wish to migrate to Australia, who would have guaranteed jobs in Australia, who are industrious and energetic but who are precluded from entry because of our present extremely tight migration quota? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake, as I have said before in this House, I am not at liberty at this stage to say what the Government’s deliberations will be, but I shall keep the honourable member’s comments in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, people who urgently need to be naturalised can expect to have their applications processed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs within a reasonable period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770426_reps_30_hor105/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1974 a joint inquiry into schools of high migrant density was undertaken by a working party from the Federal departments of Education and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the New South Wales and Victorian departments of Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has a legal- in fact, a constitutional- responsibility for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the welfare of migrants and their families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Constitutionfrom the outset- the Federal Government has been able to make laws on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and also to make laws for the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a conference of Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Melbourne on 22 October last the present Federal Minister described the Federal Government’s responsibilities towards migrants in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it we do have the responsibility in terms of entry into Australia, in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>  programs,  deportations and the like, temporary entries and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Federal Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs- a Liberal Minister- was saying in that quotation at that conference with his State peers was that once a migrant arrives in Australia he ceases to be a migrant and the Federal Government can wash its hands of any responsibility for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrants should take note that the Federal Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has gone on record with the view that ethnic affairs are not the concern of the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable gentleman attempted to challenge the acceptance by the Government and the  present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  of the Commonwealth’s responsibilities with regard to migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel sure that the honourable gentleman has read the Government’s published <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the fact that the honourable gentleman so deliberately sought to challenge the policies and views of the present Government, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  the published policy of the Liberal and National Country Parties on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs dated August 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is an essential instrument of Australia’s population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those population policies are directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties are therefore committed to the active encouragement of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at a level and of a pattern which best suits Australia’s national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To fully overcome these needs and at the same time offer the maximum opportunity for ethnic groups to continue to contribute to Australian society in general, the Liberal and National Country Parties will establish a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will also ensure the coordination of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy with other major national objectives and provide a single focal point through which matters of interest to migrants can be given prompt and effective attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To ensure that immigrant movements are geared towards overall demographic and population considerations, a Liberal/National Country Party government will establish demographic studies administered by the Depart.ment of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to provide continuous information on long term population trends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise this evening in the adjournment debate to draw the attention of the House to some of the inadequacies of the way in which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is handling the important issue of the debate on population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister made a speech- he did not advise me that he was going to deliver his speech, so I suppose it is par for the course- and he talked about the decline in the growth rate of the labour force without <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The visit is also partly to start preliminary local preparations for a visit to East Timor by a team of Australian officials from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That visit was announced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on 30 March, and it has been approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another area which will be pruned is the Australian Trade Union Training Authority which was set up by the Labor Government under Minister Clyde Cameron when Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In March 1975 when my colleague the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, presented the Trade Union Training Authority Bill he emphasised in his second reading speech the importance of trade union training remaining the sole responsibility of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is at the table I refer to a couple of extraordinary additional estimates which are found in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will remember that when the coalition parties went to the people in December 1975 one of their great promises to the migrant communities in this country was that they would re-establish a Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as a focus for their concerns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is at the table to make a full inquiry into this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770428_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To this end: It has ratified the Convention on the Status of Refugees; it is a member of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and contributes to the resettlement funds of the UNHCR; it recognises the need through its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy to fulfil the legal obligations required by the Convention and to develop special humanitarian programs for the resettlement of the displaced and/or the persecuted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A standing inter-departmental committee on refugees comprising a senior officer of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as chairman, and senior officers of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Employment and Industrial Relations, Social Security, Finance, Health and Education with other departments and the Public Service Board to be co-opted as necessary, will be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Committee will advise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on the capacity for accepting refugees; consult annually, and otherwise as necessary, with voluntary agencies regarding the numbers they would accept for resettlement; recommend co-ordination for arrival and immediate resettlement; and regularly review the intake of refugees against the capacity of resources in this country to ensure successful resettlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  fails to implement the most significant of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is worth repeating a statement made in relation to Chileans by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on 18 November in response to a question which I placed on the Notice Paper some months before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to people who will be resettled in Australia, we will go through a process of advising the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on the capacity for accepting refugees and will regularly review the intake of refugees against the capacity of resources in this country to ensure successful resettlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of Social Security became responsible for post-arrival services for migrants following the abolition of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in 1974 after work on the booklet had begun, and has therefore become nominally responsible for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-43-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I would have thought that after being the shadow spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs for 17 months the honourable member would have understood that this matter comes within the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770525_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 62 of the Migration Act, which comes within the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, requires that a parent should not remove a child from Australia where there is an order of an Australian court entitling the other parent to access to or custody of that child; in other words, irresepctive of the fact that the passport may not be an Australian passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, the strength of the Aboriginal employment section of the then Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was increased from 65 positions in December 1973 to 122 positions in September 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My grievance concerns the Government’s failure to implement its promises with regard to migrant education and the admission by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  at question time yesterday that he had no interest or involvement in assisting migrants to gain a proficiency in the English language. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before the last election the coalition parties released an election manifesto entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs Policy’ which stated that an understanding of the language, presumably English, was the most serious prob.em  to face many migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What did we get from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770526_reps_30_hor105/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I was Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Inspectorate was taking proceedings against employers at a rate of knots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, I think it is wrong that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> does not have more of the old Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> than it now has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770527_reps_30_hor105/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government spokesmen, particularly the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs Minister,  Mr MacKellar,  take every opportunity to point out alleged dire consequences if we do not boost <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes to unrealisticafly high levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I point out that I have never outlined a figure which the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> level should reach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s argument is based on questionable assertions made in the recent ‘green paper’ on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population, which was prepared by the Minister’s own department on his instruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out to the House that the Green Paper was prepared by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council of which the  President  of the honourable member’s own party, the Australian Labor Party, is a member and he was in agreement with that Green Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee also recommends detailed examinations to determine, firstly, whether Australiabased staff at 8 <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> posts should be withdrawn and the posts covered by a system of regional representation and, secondly, whether 25 positions at Trade Commissioner posts are justified by the essential workload at the posts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr McKellar)  in regard to this case and I am raising the matter so that I can place on public record the extent to which people who are in the unfortunate situation of being in Australia and classified as prohibited immigrants are being exploited by people who should know better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know who advised this person from Fiji to go to this solicitor, but apparently within the Fijian and Tongan community here in Australia, this solicitor, whose name I will reveal in a few moments, has a name for being able to do something with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the solicitor was to do was to get an application form from my constituent to forward to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs for the purpose of trying to get him permanent residency in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If people have complaints about solicitors or organisations which they believe are charging unfairly for services which, I reiterate, are available free of charge to people who come to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, then in the case of solicitors they should make the facts available to the Law Society in the State of residence and in the case of any organisation they should make the facts known to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware that upwards of 15 000, perhaps even 20 000, applications for citizenship are in hand and are being processed very slowly in Melbourne, holding up the right to citizenship, and therefore the right of the people involved to get on the electoral roll? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who will follow me in the debate must dissociate himself from the remarks of the Minister for Primary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, I nope that the deportation sections of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act are not implemented in accordance with the wishes of the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister will not exercise his discretion in the way he did when dealing with the representations of an Italian worker,  Mr Salemi  who is still under threat of deportation, notwithstanding that three High Court judges indicated that there had been a denial of natural justice and that the other three High Court judges were of the opinion that  Mr Salemi  had been treated unfairly and that the concept of natural justice did not apply in the administration of the Minister’s decision under the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it has not been proclaimed because Ministers like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs want to write into the legislation sections which would not preclude the operation of section 14, of the migration section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a simple matter of fact that people from the United Kingdom and Eire have formed the backbone of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first actions I took as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was to go to the United Kingdom in May last year, which was the first visit by a Minister of the Fraser Government to the United Kingdom, to reassure them that Australia did not- I emphasise these words- have an antipathy towards the British migrants but that in fact we welcomed them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the Labor Government which disbanded the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and incorporated it in die Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party Government which set up the new Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have had special Indo-Chinese refugees projects, special arrangements for the migration of Lebanese, amnesty for illegal migrants, the abolition of re-entry visas, the establishment of an ethnic affairs branch, the establishment of the national accreditation authority for interpreters and translators, migrant resource centres, the establishment of the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council, the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council and the establishment of a permanent broadcasting authority which provides a special broadcasting service to cater for the rights of ethnic radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>am asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 30 March 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-87-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1019)  Mr Morris  asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1  June 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770816_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-87-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time there was perpetual discussion about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and whether the level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> placed too many demands upon our capacity to provide goods and services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the one variable we have, that of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has in fact been discounted by the previous administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has slowed to the point where we have no growth in the labour force and we now have built into it certain immobility and certain structural difficulties associated with relocating people and retraining people at the same time in order to fill some of our requirements in a rational way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population is worthy of considerable nonparty political discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the future, with less scope for transfers from rural areas and, possibly, less <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, there could well be problems of that nature in seeking to ensure a balanced supply of the different labour skills required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With its lack of cultivatable land and its limited resources the West Bank has been an area of emigration rather than <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770817_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did it bring in a Bill that is wide enough to give me, as Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the right to sack Brian Tregillis, the Deputy Head of the Department which, of course, I could do under this BDI? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will remember that at the first question time of this Parliament he encouraged all illegal immigrants who were covered by his amnesty offer to come forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is also addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and refers to a statement in the Budget Speech last week which said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has decided not to set a specific <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for 1977-78 but to determine in-take on the basis of numbers of eligible applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a change in the attitude of the Government in relation to an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770824_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fairness, I must say that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  stands firmly behind principle- any principle which will serve him for the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alleged activities of the organisation FORCE referred to in the newspaper article are the concern of the Attorney-General, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Administrative Services in relation to aspects other than passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-55-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One needs only to look at the list of skills provided for prospective migrants by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to know that a training scheme should be related to those shortages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that, although we found ways of improving the RED scheme- which was introduced by the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)after  the scheme had been operating for over 1 8 months, this is no criticism of the initial concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, with this Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  were not having any of that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of these people approached me when the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  was Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and asked me to see what I could do about getting  Mr Salemi  out of the country because he was a communist, not because of the work he was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 January 1976, flushed with success at being admitted to the Ministry- perhaps he will be the next to go- the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs announced an amnesty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall add to that by pointing out the quite unsatisfactory legislative framework within which  Mr Salemi  has had to work and also detail the actions of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the omissions and lack of action by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  consequent upon the report of the Ombudsman in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, he drew attention to the report of the Bland Committee on Administrative Discretions about the attitude of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to the rights of migrants in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General, as he then was, pointed out that when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was absent from Australia he acted as <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is on the record in the Ombudsman’s report that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has changed its position on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter relates to problems of interpreting the law concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and, even worse, to the misinterpretation of what might be deemed to be Press releases of a Minister announced as being government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say at the outset that during the last election the Government announced its policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> with the famous line: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would say that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKeller)  should certainly act in accordance with the Ombudsman’s impartial investigation of the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is it that the Government is just wiping its hands of the situation and allowing the confrontation to be between only the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and  Mr Salemi? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was responsible in the first instance for taking up with the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic affairs the question of  Mr Salemi’s  readmission to Australia after he had been out here at the special invitation of the Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and Their Families, known as FILEF, had gone back home and then had come back again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall take up a few points that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would have fought tooth and nail within the Ministry to ensure that benefits were raised to a livable level, knowing that the proportion of unemployed coming directly or indirectly under his Department’s care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also represented Australia overseas as a member of the Australian delegation to the 27th session of the International Labour Organisation in Paris in 1946, as  Chairman  of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Committee which toured Europe in 1945 and as leader of the parliamentary delegation to Japan in 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was chairman of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not generally known that he went overseas virtually to hand pick the ships which were to bring the first migrants to Australia under the great plan of Arthur Calwell when he initiated the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-From time to time the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has indicated that the migration program is administered to ensure that migrants do not add to the number of people unemployed or take jobs from qualified Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With reference to the administrative procedures purporting to prevent such a situation, can the Minister indicate how the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs ensures that a migrant recruited to help to fill a vacancy in, say, Perth will go to Perth rather than to Sydney or elsewhere; how the Department ensures that no Australian worker is available to fill the vacancy in question; and in what circumstances the Department would recommend retraining an unemployed Austraiian rather than go to the expensive and time consuming effort of recruiting a migrant overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government release the list of jobs classified as in short supply, which is supposed to guide the recruitment procedures of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the other matters raised by the honourable member, I have never said, and this Government has never said, that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be seen as a substitute for training or retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770913_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I see it, there are two important issues: Firstly, how our population is running by world standards and, secondly, what effect <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has on our work force or, better still, our unemployment situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under previous LiberalCountry Party governments the broad policy was to increase our population by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by an average of 1 per cent of the population each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, because of economic pressures, our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has dropped off dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the opportunity in this debate to make some reference to the reply of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to a question about the entry into Australia of Domenico Barbaro. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Newspaper headlines this week and an answer given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> this morning provide even more grounds for concern about  Mr Grassby  ‘s suitability to hold down even a clerk’s job in the Public Service, let alone the position of a $44,000 a year commissioner who is supposed to mediate in cases in which it is alleged that racial overtones might exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This morning the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in effect informed the House that his Department has strenuously advised  Mr Grassby  that deported Domenico Barbaro, who is currently serving 14 to 18 years in prison in Italy, should not be allowed to re-enter Australia because of his criminal background. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 6 September 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770915_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-40-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the question of resettlement, my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is not proposing at this stage to alter any migrant entry policy in respect of its application to Rhodesians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had been, an unfortunate person named  Mr Salemi  would have been able to appeal against the decision of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other aspects concern the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Administrative Services and the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now concentrating on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and consular work relating to Lebanese who have applied to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the easing of civil unrest in Lebanon, normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures have now replaced the special concessional arrangements under which some 10,700 Lebanese came to Australia in 1976-77. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures have now replaced those special concessional arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave- A study of the economic costs and benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was one of three projects commissioned by the Commonwealth Government in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of these, the National Population Inquiry, headed by Professor W. D. Borne, O.B.E., and the 1973 <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Survey were completed in good time and produced valuable results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report of the 1973 <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Survey, entitled ‘A Decade of Migrant Settlement’, was tabled in Parliament in September 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These two reports provide a valuable data base for the formulation of Australia’s future population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now refer to the report on the third project, the cost benefit study of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Associate Professor J. R. Wilson, of the University of Sydney, in 1970 undertook to carry out a cost/ benefit study of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His appointment was recommended by the then <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council and the project was subsequently placed under its general supervision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> pressed to have the study completed as did I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that I will, in expressing some regret about the apparent quality of the report, speak not only for myself and the Government but also for previous Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who, like me, had hoped for a greater contribution to an understanding of the economic impact of the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program than this report offers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that it is inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Salemi case the Ombudsman went to great lengths to go behind a supposed ministerial discretion to pursue the administrative decisions which had been made and the advice which had been proffered to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who live in the new Mallee electorate will not have easy access to departmental offices, such as those concerned with health, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, housing and repatriation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These include civil aviation, cultural affairs, refugee problems, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, health, drug problems, travellers in distress, disaster relief, information services and numerous other responsibilities of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771006_reps_30_hor106/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 14 September 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771011_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-35-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKeller)  was also in the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771012_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that I countered by reporting to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  under whose control the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  comes, the way that a Queensland lady felt following the claim of the Commissioner that in Japan the Japanese are taught that all Australians are racist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has written to me, informing me- his letter is dated 22 September- that under the Racial Discrimination Act such inquiries are to be made only by the Commissioner himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> boom was begun under a Labor government but unfortunately for the thousands and thousands of migrants, services fell very quickly under a government that did nothing for them for 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 we transferred the section from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  carries far more weight in her party than does the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  whose performance is causing some concern even in his own ranks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic affairs are challenged they quote figures for the whole branch rather than for the migrant welfare section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Encel was to carry out a similar inquiry early in 1976 at a very low cost to the community, but the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs sacked him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He admitted that it was his own Government in 1974, when it split up the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and moved settlement services across to the Department of Social Security, that caused the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been checking to find out about these migrant welfare courses and I find that the reference is probably to a course of training for bilingual welfare officers who were to be recruited to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The telephone interpreter service for which the Leader of the Opposition claimed credit, in fact was authorised in July 1972 by the then Commonwealth Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Dr Forbes,  who was a Liberal member of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the time left to me I want to briefly list some of the main achievements of the Government in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs since December 1975 because it is important that the record be set straight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First and foremost, I repeat that a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was established immediately we took office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This set aside the disastrous decision of the Labor Government which split up the previous Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has reconstituted the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council- - APIC - on 31 March 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We published Australia’s first Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time in our history since Federation the Australian people have been given the opportunity to make their views known on matters relating to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population policies <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We broadened the family reunion categories for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and allowed for the entry of entrepreneurs and proprietors of small personal businesses in addition to national need categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  began by telling us how he was delighted to see migrants become wanted and valued members of the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs were concerned about these matters he would be concerned about migrants- particularly women migrants- who go to hospitals, who speak no English and who find no translators to translate their requirements to the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on the magnificent job he has done since assuming office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He and the Government have done four main things: Firstly, they have restored the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which was cut off at the roots by the Australian Labor Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had many cases in which people have come to me in circumstances where approval was given a few years ago and then it was arbitrarily cut out overnight because the former Government got into economic trouble and decided that the way to overcome that trouble was to cut out the previous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second thing the Minister did was to institute a thorough and sensible population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Federal Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  provided additional teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to the fact that time is limited, I should like to refer to three particular areas which come within the responsibility of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to illustrate the intolerable neglect, once again, of this Government which is endeavouring to dupe migrant communities in this country into believing that the Government is acting m their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is exaggerated by the Government’s dated policy of considering <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in a compartmentalised capsule divorced from all those policy areas affecting it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking in the debate on a matter of public importance I did not elect that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs should answer the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a tug-of-war with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs the Department of Social Security won out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pleasure in this debate to be able to offer some informed views on the performance of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in relation to his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Labor was in office it linked up <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and all the matters related to our ethnic people with matters concerning labour- we had a Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did not have a ministerial hand who was able to devote himself fully to attending to the needs of the migrant community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately upon our coming to office a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the first acts of the Minister- for this he deserves congratulation- was to reconstitute the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite know, as I do, that that Council has been asked to consider the implications of population change, developments in research in Australia and overseas in the areas of population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the probable long term effects of changing patterns of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes and, additionally, the way in which <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes can be planned to complement other national policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that, Australia’s first Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australian population was produced and published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this debate on these important funds which are being allocated to bring immigrants to Australia, I ask the honourable member whether he is prepared to state clearly in what areas he would run down our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After reading through the speech he made in this House on 22 March 1977, I should like to know whether perhaps he wants to tail down the family reunion aspects of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or is he perhaps saying that if we tail down our active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, which is evidenced in the document we are debating, it is the refugees whom he does not want? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the gentleman who wants to tail down our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy because he happens to believe m minimum population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the spokesman on these matters for  Her  Majesty’s Opposition he might be prepared at some point of time to clarify which area of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program he wants to see tailed down, because these estimates allocate the funds necessary to maintain an active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During his term of office the Minister has expanded the family reunion categories for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and allowed people who are bringing business skills, money and so on to Australia that will enable them to commence businesses in Australia, to be eligible under the criteria for entry to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  conceded in that debate, very few of those services indeed are the responsibility of his Department, I propose to confine my remarks to a couple of matters that are within the province of his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the couple of minutes remaining to me I want to talk about one other item in the appropriation for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ministers responsible for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> within the States are well aware of this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Minister for Education has had clear assurances from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and also from the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  that there will be a commitment to maintain levels at least sufficient for last year and to enable the courses to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I commend the Government on its allocations for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-There are a couple of issues to which I should Uke to refer in the few minutes we are given to debate the appropriations for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)-  I am sure he agrees with me that such a disincentive should not exist for former citizens of Germany to become Australian citizens- to initiate discussions again with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They make particular reference to the Mafia and therefore it is relevant to this discussion on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member should not be debating organised crime; he should be debating the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this final point on the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>: I am not one of those who believe <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ought to be cut out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one who believes that an excellent argument can be made, for economic and other reasons, in favour of continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on a significant scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot remember who signed the particular articles; indeed I am not sure that they were signed at all, but they contain ridiculous propositions with which, deplorably, the Australian Conservation Foundation associates itself, to the effect that before the Government increases <span class="highlight">immigration</span> it must consider the subject in the light of the Federal Environment Protection Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely, if that is so, the same sort of thing should be done before it decreases <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank my colleagues for their support of the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have an emphathy with the honourable members for St George and Grayndler, feeling deeply as they do about the personal problems they face among the large ethnic groups within their electorates, but I hope we will soon see the whole subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> lifted to its former position of warranting bipartisanship on the part of all members of this House, rather than slanging matches across the Chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no easy subject to discuss and I believe it a great shame that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> debate has become so very political in the last two or three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I should like to pay a tribute to the professionalism that exists in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a source of personal pleasure when this Government decided to make the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department a separate department again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who has sat through the whole of this debate, for his personal concern and involvement in the problems of migrants in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute in this debate to people in the Sydney office of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department, people such as George Austin, Brian O’Neill, Bruce Donald and John Vanderness, among others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we have within the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department some very dedicated professional people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my own experience I believe that is a good relationship between the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the discussion earlier today of a matter of public importance, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  gave some figures in respect of the various facets of services relating to and for migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I argue the case, or appear to be knocking <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, let me assert the areas in which I am in favour of accepting migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I rise to support the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and to congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on the job he has done since taking over this portfolio since December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> must surely be one of the important facets of government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These trends add up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with little or no natural increase in population and only a very small net gain from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has in statements to this House made it clear that there is a numerical decline in what has historically been the mainstay of the labour force- the male worker- and the risk that we shall become increasingly inward looking and a stagnant society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appropriations for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs provide for a situation in which the intake of migrants will be rather static. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can see from the Budget Speech that the Government has decided not to set a specific <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for 1977-78 but to determine intake on the basis of numbers eligible through overseas selection processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is made for assisted passages for 16,000 people, which is approximately the same number as that provided for under the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is similar to the number which arrived in Australia under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expenditure on the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will rise by $2.2m this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note the employment figures in the various <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices that Australia has established throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia must keep up an active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy immediately the economic <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In debating the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs I want to raise one or two specific matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications were made to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs for a grant-in-aid but these were rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some 12 months to two years ago a decision was made to relocate offices of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to the Geelong area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Geelong an officer is working in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> area with the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were provided up until the time <span class="highlight">immigration</span> became part of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Employment Service is not able to carry the additional work load of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to him that these services were provided in the past and I think the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has a responsibility to provide those services in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not realise that partly because of the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and partly because of the downturn in the birth rate, Australia was growing at a rate of about 114 per cent compared with the 9 per cent at which the Labor Party wanted the Australian Capital Territory to grow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there was not going to be <span class="highlight">immigration</span>; the Labor Party demonstrated that it was not in favour of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This rapid growth cannot be sustained in a country which has cut down on its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake because of Labor’s policies, and in a country which has a rapidly decreasing birthrate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771013_reps_30_hor107/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs been drawn to a report that a number of Iraqi representatives are about to visit Australia for a breakfast? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has one library, located at the Barton Offices, Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly, the publications in the Department’s library cover the subjects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, emigration, the education, health and welfare of migrants, automatic data processing and demography. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771019_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular the Commissioner mentioned the agencies of bankruptcy, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and foreign exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late in 1975 the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  McClelland, requested  Mr R.  M. Northrop, Q.C.-as he then was- to report on the views of the parties to the industry as to what they saw as the problems associated with the existing arrangements and the action they considered appropriate for the Government to take as to future arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771020_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware that the New South Wales State Government is experiencing great difficulty in maintaining adult migrant education services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a Federal responsibility, is it not also a Federal responsibility to provide adequate finance so that migrants may be encouraged to learn English quickly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason is as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  says. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771025_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these work categories, a minimum of 3 years’ practical experience together with appropriate academic qualifications is required for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771026_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-32-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 2 June 1977 I raised in this Parliament an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> fee racket which was being practiced by a Sydney solicitor, a  Mr D.  P. Khoury who practices under the name of Benjamin and Khoury at 184 Victoria Street, Potts Point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made all these documents available to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who has agreed to their being incorporated in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed by reliable sources in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that this solicitor has extracted similar amounts of money from more than 600 unfortunate people who are seeking to become residents of Australia and has done absolutely nothing for any of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this matter is in the mind of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  but unfortunately it appears that even he can do very little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Al  Grassby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, another investigation was ordered by the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  McClelland, in October 1975, and was conducted by  Mr Northrop,  as he then was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech, late in 1975 the then Minister or Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  McClelland, requested  Mr R.  M. Northrop, Q.C. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771101_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and community relations, the honourable member for Melbourne, committed Labor to a dramatic increase in education spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter suggests that the ethnic element must be a permanent feature of this land and this pre-supposes that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will be a continuing thing at the levels we have seen previously and that we will have a continuing quantum of new Australians within our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recommended that further consideration be given to the introduction of a national identity card system which could also have advantages in other areas such as health and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771104_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware of complaints regarding unfair treatment concerning taxation refunds to overseas born people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, whom I note is wearing a white buttonhole today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  will note my remarks and when he replies to the debate on this clause will give a clear statement of the reason for this differential between non-State and State schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771107_reps_30_hor107/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, I am pleased that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKelllar)  in his second reading speech did stress that if we are going to control our environment the only way we can control it is by a spirit of co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) As at 30 June 1977, 144 Australia based staff as well as 419 locally engaged staff were employed at offices of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to indicate that this concern is expressed on both sides of the House, I will quote from the House of Representatives  Hansard  of 1 1 September 1975 when the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  asked a question of the then Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> inform the House why the unemployment figures compiled by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> from its Commonwealth Employment Service records are substantially in excess of those produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics through its quarterly labour force survey? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are one of the few countries that could consider the option of vastly expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that the net benefits of such <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would outweigh the difficulties in employing migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was disappointed that there was no reference in the Governor-General’s Speech to an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Government cut <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to 30,000 people per year when it became apparent that unemployment in Australia was approaching 5 per cent of the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When departures from Australia were taken into account, this reduced <span class="highlight">immigration</span> figure resulted in a net loss to Australia of between 5,000 and 8,000 people per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report read: ‘Unemployment could be cut by stepping up <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rather than cutting it back’,  Mr Ian  Spicer said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Canberra yesterday, the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Minister,  Mr MacKellar,  said that any cuts in migrant intake would retard economic recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it came into office in 1975 the Government increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from the 30,000 of the Whitlam Government to 70,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> must be stepped up in the not too distant future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before doing so, I clarify a misunderstanding that has arisen following comments made by me in the last few days concerning my attitude to migrants and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, why has the Government changed the whole administrative arrangements for migrants by once again concentrating all power in all areas of migrant welfare in the most centralised department of all, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should people be forced to seek help from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With this new efficient rearrangementwe were told that one of the main justifications for electing a Liberal Government was that it knows how to run things better and how to be far more efficient than the Labor Government was- will we see a duplication of staff in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to perform all these sundry services that were being provided very adequately and when not provided adequately were being expanded rapidly in all these other departments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let me turn to some of the doubts about our assumptions on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that have got me into hot water in recent days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me commence by turning to the Press statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and the article he wrote in the  Age  in response to an article by  Dr Birrell  entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Unemployment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was one of a series of articles which make up a book entitled  The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Issue in Australia,  which has just been released. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister and I were both asked for our comments on one particular chapter which dealt with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr Cass has called for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to be cut to the bone as happened under the Whitlam Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If migration does do the thing it is claimed to do- be an economic stimulus and create jobs- the Government should rapidly and immediately increase the migration rate now and not wait until economic circumstances improve, for that implies that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inhibits or depresses economic recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the cautionin other words, the fact that the Government does not rapidly and immediately increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates- reflects the true effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and the stated policy, or what the Government goes on about publicly, about increasing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is simply humbug, an ideological hangup, a nefarious plot to weaken the trade union movement by increasing the pool of unemployment or, worst of all, a simplistic acceptance of up to now generaly held myths whose consequences have never been assessed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just what are the effects of high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should stop talking in this humbug fashion about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> helping to stimulate all these things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780222_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the presence of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony),  the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair), Senator Withers,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock), Mr Speaker,  and even the Premier of Western Australia and a number of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Carlton)  yesterday in his maiden speech, which we all thought was excellent, did venture his point of view that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> may well be rapidly expanded in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was borne out by the fact that it so dramatically cut <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The problems associated with illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and so on are also involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been a Federal matter since Federation, especially since the great post war government sponsored <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is and will continue to be one of non-discrimination in the sense that eligibility criteria are applied in the same way to all people applying to migrate to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Women should stay at home and have children instead of going out to work, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Michael  MacKellar, said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply conclude by commenting on some points made the other night by the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and migrant education in Wollongong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not opened by the previous Government, and I can assure the honourable member for Cunningham that the volume of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the last two years has not been so dramatic that the situation has changed monumentally in Wollongong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the current horrific rates of unemployment for all Australians, particularly migrants, the Government goes on blindly insisting that the rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be substantially increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major rationale is that Australia’s work force lacks skilled personnel in particular areas and that these bottlenecks prevent employment of more skilled workers, but the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  produces no facts to prove his case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> does nothing to change the current situation and may indeed exacerbate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Government insists on a large scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to meet the needs of industry, it does little to alleviate the continuing problems of migrants after their arrival in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it is at such a crucial time that the Government decides to transfer migrant services to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, despite the increasing clamour from various migrant welfare organisations for more funds, for reasons best known to itself the Government has inhibited the Department of Social Security- now it is the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs- from distributing the funds theoretically available for grantsinaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has shown little concern for the high rate of return home to their countries of origin among migrants, particularly the professional and skilled- those groups which supposedly justify further increases in the rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not time we stopped using people as factory fodder, as tools of economic management, and developed a policy for migrants, not just an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Maribymong has over recent times changed the approach of the Opposition in relation to its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggests that we should- I think I am using his words- cut <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to the bone but in doing so we should continue the family reunion and refugee categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about a suggestion that the Government is in favour of a highly increased rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will know that under the Labor Party Government, in 1975-76, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> declined to an all time low of 52,000 people- the lowest since 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It demonstrated this at the earliest opportunity by the re-establishment of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government reintroduced the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and expanded it to include ethnic affairs,, and subsequently has added other services to that Department- settlement services, telephone interpreter services, adult education services, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through the ethnic affairs branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, which as I have already mentioned this Government set up, we have brought together departments concerned with services to migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since I became Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs I have had regular consultations with the appropriate State Ministers not only in respect of intakes but also in terms of services provided to migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I am on that point, I point out to the honourable member for Maribymong, the spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs for the Opposition, that in all instances all State Premierswhether they be on my side of politics or on the honourable member’s side- have supported a continued active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by stating one fact which should never be forgotten: Under the Labor Administration we saw a halving of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rate and a doubling of the migrant unemployment rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>High <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was particularly destructive of social well-being in times of high unemployment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is a tragedy that there has to be a newspaper headline in many instances before we can get a common-sense approach to a policy matter in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a word of sense in what was attributed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  recently, when he was reported to have said that more women should stay in the homes and produce children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the committee’s report has not been presented to the Government, why has the Government gone ahead with major restructuring of migrant services, including the transfer of the telephone interpreter service, the Outreach program and migrant services sections from the Department of Social Security to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, before receiving a report which presumably would be advising the Government on these very matters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Mr Speaker, I wish to add one or two points to what has been said by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780307_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The post-war era was a long period of dynamism fuelled by the baby boom of the 1940s and the 1950s and a wave of high level <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I apologise for not informing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Goff  signed the necessary papers for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, pointing out that he would provide her with shelter and any means of sustenance should it be required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have learnt since this case came to my notice that people from Canada who want to migrate here in similar circumstances, who have no independent means and are not wealthy, have obtained money temporarily from a sponsor- a relative or someone else- and then have been able to show the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that they have independent means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I had discussions with Thai officials- the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and others- in regard to refugees generally, which is a matter for my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to discuss when I report to him on those discussions, I also raised with the Vietnamese Vice-Foreign Minister the question of 400 applicants who had been approved for entry to Australia by my colleague but regarding whom there has been little progress achieved by our representations to the Vietnamese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join in opposing the views put by members of the Opposition regarding our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot accept the view that, because we have high unemployment in Australia, we should curtail our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that what we want in Australia is a medium <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, a policy which will allow the re-uniting of families with a greater spread than is applicable at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that, in the ensuing three years, our Government will have a good, hard look at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the basis of a wider family re-union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no comment other than to say this: An analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> statistics shows that there is presently an increasing number of non-white people coming to Australia as compared with the situation 10 or 12 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely white Rhodesians who have exactly the same type of living oppressions in their homeland as other refugees do, are entitled to be considered for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that point because at present there is very great concern amongst the Australian people about our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this: Turn on the taps of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at a moderate rate so that we can have family re-union and so that we can have skilled workers and some unskilled workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Wilson report on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been under way for almost eight years, yet no Government has seen fit seriously to consider that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a curious ambiguity there is in our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy when we can allow people in- admittedly they are refugees- without great attention to the procedures they have undergone to get here, yet we refuse to allow into our country a blind girl from England. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall leave the matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at that point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780314_reps_31_hor108/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take the appropriate steps that would enable him and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to be aware of the potential need for a refugee policy and ask them to meet delegations of members of the relevant associations in Australia and delegations of members of the relevant Lebanese Press and assure them of the Australian Government’s policy so that it may be disseminated to residents in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member will be aware that on the day following his asking the question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, responsibility for the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Guardianship of Children) Act was transferred to me under the Administrative Arrangements Order published in the Commonwealth Government Gazette of the 23rd February 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be noted that in 1974-75 and 1975-76 my Department incorporated functions of the present Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> figures have been excluded in the comparative table to facilitate a comparison of expenditures by my Department as it presently exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-79">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am one of the people who hope that our population projections which have been reduced in the past few years for two reasons- lower fertility rates and much lower <span class="highlight">immigration</span>- will move ahead somewhat more quickly than at present projected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The progress could be made by an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates to try to counteract the very rapid decrease that honourable members opposite caused when they somehow ceased to believe in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recognise that there are many people in this country who come from other lands, but surely the spirit of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is that if a person adopts Australia as his homeland it is his bounden duty to act in the best interests of Australia and Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780406_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many thousands, indeed millions, from other countries have found homes here, have contributed greatly to the economic strength of Australia, added to our cultural heritage and made this a much better nation as a result of their <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of their grandfathers, relatives or forebears to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian people and that an ageing population growing at zero growth is not in the best interests of this country’s contribution to the prosperity of its own people and the South East Asian region and that, therefore, policies be adopted concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the Australian family, which remedy the present trend of events having regard to the development, employment and social justice obligations of Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are concerned now with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> because we are concerned with the economic defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So, for a whole host of social and hard economic reasons, I ask the Government to be bold in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and to be bold with a sense of justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should not be thought that those people making unauthorised arrivals in Australia, largely arriving at Darwin, have not been subject to Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws; they have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am a member of the Government parties’ <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs committee and I know that we have a serious problem with our population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to raise the issue of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rumoured that there is currently before Cabinet a submission which would effectively raise the level of net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from the current levels of 50,000 a year to 70,000 a year for each year until 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also to be hoped that the Government will make no decision before the promised White Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is published and ample time is allowed for public discussion and debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view there is no clear basis on which to announce major changes in Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, there are a number of concerns which should be taken seriously and resolved before a large-scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is resumed, on the lines of programs adopted in the 1950s and 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This problem would be compounded still further if increased rates of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hard to believe that there are not enough workers in Australia to fill these jobs or to be retrained to work on this development and that we have to emphasise the need to expand the nation’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One does not have to be critical of the concept of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to be most concerned about current developments in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780510_reps_31_hor109/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer I received reflected an appreciation by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that there is a problem and that procedures were changing to cope with that problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Once a foot is placed on Australian soil it is difficult to have it removed even when there are others who seek to enter this country through the authorised door of normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedure and should have a higher priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>In all areas of defence, security, health, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, foreign affairs and drug trafficking we should be alert to the dangers and change accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is being exacerbated by the deflationary economic policies of this Government and its failure to implement adequate retraining, manpower and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the source of information and expressions of view included in the publication  For the Ethnic Media  issued by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was thought some dme ago that there may be some cases relating to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> decisions which could be the subject of a judicial review, and the Government was sensitive about that and did not want to have a situation in which anybody could review a decision of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 22 May 1977 the Government decided to establish an advisory body to advise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on refugee policy and operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This body is the standing interdepartmental committee on refugees, comprising senior officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs (which chairs the committee), Prime Minister and Cabinet, Employment and Industrial Relations, Social Security, Finance, Health and Education, with other departments and the Public Service Board being co-opted as necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As employment in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is determined by the capacity of officers to meet the normal requirements for employment in the Commonwealth Public Service, a requirement that a person should or should not be a first generation migrant or should or should not be from a particular ethnic background would appear to be in conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-6">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the specific statistical bases for the Government’s planned <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in the light of (a) the inadequacy of current Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force surveys in terms of identifying (i) the extent of unemployment at State levels by age, (ii) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, and (iii) the incidence of unemployment among specific ethnic groups and (b) the inadequacy of current Commonwealth Employment Service registration figures in terms of identifying (i) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, (ii) the nonregistration of married women with working husbands, and (iii) the arbitrary accreditation in Australia of qualifications gained overseas by job applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (b) The ‘planned’ component of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake is restricted to those migrants who possess professional, technical or trade skills recognised in Australia and for whom it is considered there is a strong and continuing demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-49-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I address my question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leaveOnly a handful of issues has, in the last few months, attracted more persistent speculation than the prospect of a revised <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is rarely argued in detached terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue of Indo-Chinese refugees has brought all Australians face to face with the reality that no longer are we insulated and isolated from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> questions of immense significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> ought to be above partisan political polemics, and largely it has been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue between us has never been the fact of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but the quantum and nature of intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1974 <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies have been very tightly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While there has been a shortage of hard data on which to reach firm conclusions regarding the economic effects of population growth and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, many have seen a link between post-war economic development and large-scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was against this background that, in 1976, the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council prepared a Green Paper on ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issues were discussed at conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs over the past year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a remarkable degree of unanimity among the States on the importance of a continued positive approach to population building through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and on related policy measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has never been, in Australia, so comprehensive a review of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Though the Government must give priority to resolving the prevailing economic difficulties facing Australia, it believes that population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies lay the foundations for tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In defence of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  I agree that he has conformed with the convention in the sense that when a statement is to be made it is provided a couple of hours beforehand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Opposition commends the Government on finally producing an agreed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy; that is, I take it, agreed amongst themselves, because even in the last couple of weeks there has been some discord between various Ministers over this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For what purports to be a major statement on the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies it says remarkably little and virtually none of it is new. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Government is proposing a substantial increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake to 90,000 people a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs practising a policy of increasing the numbers by stealth? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Minister ‘this program underlines the Government’s faith in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as an element in economic growth’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a far cry from his previous statements arguing that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> provides an economic stimulus and increased employment opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To increase our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake when Australia faces a high and, in seasonally adjusted terms, rising rate of unemployment and a growing indigenous work force is totally irresponsible, in our view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government claims that there is a shortage of skilled workers which can be met only by increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More significantly, selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has tended to have a negative effect on our training programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the Government’s rhetoric to the contraryand I am not blaming the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs for this because it is not his responsibility- <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has acted as an alternative to training or retraining our own work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exploration of long-term solutions to unemployment has been put off partly because the Government and the employers can avoid the difficult decisions by claiming to overcome shortterm skill shortages through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today’s unemployment problem is not merely a reflection of the low level of economic activity but, even if it were, an increase in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake would not have any significant effect on the level of economic activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is claimed that by enlarging the domestic market <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will increase the efficiency of industry through economies of scale.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is also supposed to increase business confidence and hence investment by providing a guarantee of continuous growth in the domestic market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Economic recovery by new investment stimulus is more likely to result from recovery in demand for our exports rather than from the dubious stimulus to domestic investment attributable to marginal increases in the size of the market from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the proposed level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would represent a growth rate in the market of less than half of one per cent over the present rate of increase; hardly of much relevance to manufacturers unable to sell their goods today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other programs such as the initial settlement program, cost estimates by the Galbally committee were based on the current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes, and even then it would take three years to cover the estimated bare minimum of those needing such a service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government now undertake to increase funds for those programs in line with its increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as proposed by the Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can an increased selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program be justified to those people who have already migrated to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780607_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has made that clear, at least over the next triennium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The supply of doctors is currently running in excess of the Committee’s projections because of three main factors: population has grown at a slower rate than expected; the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of doctors is much greater than expected; and medical schools are producing more graduates than expected as a result of lower student wastage rates and adjustments to courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780608_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-59-68">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are arrows pointing to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)-  these men- these politicians- afraid of offending the United Nations are now breaking faith with those who died and suffered to keep Asian invaders out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the fact that I think the leaflet exaggerates the problems in Great Britain, I point out that Australia in the formulation of its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies has always tried to learn from the experiences of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the aims of our pattern of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is to try to ensure that we do not have developing in particular areas under-privileged enclaves of people who form a problem in an area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But to try to base an attitude towards <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the sort of puerile propaganda contained in this type of leaflet does not do any good for the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the latest population projectionsallowing for an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target of 70,000 persons annually and assuming that we return to the participation rates of February 1 978 which were much lower than those for 1977 or 1976- the work force can be expected to rise from 6,384,200 in 1978 to 7,000,000 in 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780912_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us assume a continuation of current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies resulting in a net contribution to the labour force of approximately 20,000 a year; a return to the pre- 1974 trend in female participation rates by about 1981, remembering that our female participation rates are still significantly below those in a number of industrialised countries; and that young people participate in education and the labour force at present rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780914_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand from the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that this Bill is expected to provide some $10m in income for the rest of this financial year and some $13m for a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it would not be terribly difficult for the airlines to provide the Taxation Office or the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs with the number of outgoing travellers who qualify to pay the departure tax and to make that payment to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has to set up a special office to collect the departure tax quite a considerable amount of the tax collected would be eaten up in overheads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I hope that the Minister can advise us of the details of whether these stamps will be available at the various <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices, in the capital cities, in the regional areas all over Australia and the Department of Foreign Affairs offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These tax and exemption stamps will be obtainable from regional offices of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, from Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs booths at airports and major sea ports, from Customs offices at ports where the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs does not have offices and of course at Department of Foreign Affairs passport offices throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an important point: If a carrier or an agent should wish to arrange the affixing of a tax stamp to a client’s ticket in order to facilitate passenger travel arrangements, stamps will be available for bulk sale from offices of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet we have the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs taking charge of this legislation as though he does not realise and the Government does not concede that it is not an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matter but an imposition on the workers of this country who are going away for an occasional holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780920_reps_31_hor110/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I request the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, who is sitting at the table, to ask the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  to have a look at this matter with an open mind to ascertain whether we might be better off by removing the sales tax on these items so as to improve the profits of the retail trade and retain or bring back employment opportunities in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs because, in my view, the activities and initiatives of the Government in this area represent one of the major success stories of this Government over the past  2Vi  years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I thank the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  who is the Opposition spokesman in this area for the way in which he has really given strong basic support to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the present Government which saw the need to establish a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> with which migrants would establish contact initially and which would continue to provide a special contact point for migrants during their subsequent settlement in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it was the Labor Party which did away with a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand this Government reintroduced the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and expanded it to include ethnic affairs, a recognition of the fact that the Government does not see migrants as being just workers but rather as people with a unique and cultural heritage which we should encourage them to foster as they become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Goverment and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, who is at the table, on this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to say a few words about the Government’s recently announced intention to increase Australia ‘s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I state that under the Labor Government in 1975-76 Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> reached the lowest level since 1947 when there was an intake of 52,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government, on the other hand, has decided to increase the net annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake to 70,000 for the first year of the triennial rolling program which commenced in the year 1 978-79. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On balance, in my opinion, this expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program should be welcomed by all Australians; but it must be done sensibly, with caution and with a certain degree of flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult in times of high unemployment to gain widespread acceptance of the need for an expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span> poliCy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can provide a labour force mobility which might not otherwise exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can meet occupational shortages and help to overcome lags in domestic retraining schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can help to provide a balance to the work force component of the population which would grow only at diminishing rates with the present and projected combination of a declining natural population growth rate and an aging of that population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> also can improve expectations of the business community regarding future markets, thereby influencing its output and investment decisions, and it can, of course, create economies of scale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also make the point that those who state that higher <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates, coupled with capital intensification, will lead automatically to higher unemployment should realise that historically Australia has been able to maintain near full employment at times of high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and increasing capital to labour ratios. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are also a number of unknowns which could influence the nature of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On balance, I support an expanded <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program on both economic and non-economic grounds; but it must be implemented with caution, flexibility and good sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also mention that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has to be framed within a long term perspective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decisions taken now, and within the next few years, about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters will have a permanent, long term effect on the size and composition of the Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, who is at the table. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the best Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that we have seen for several decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some months ago the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  wrote to us and gave us guidelines as to what we were to say at those ceremonies, gently rapped our knuckles and said that we should not be political. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In closing, I would hope that at some stage, instead of leaving it to the Galbally Committee, advisory councils and so on, we can have what the British Parliament has, namely, a parliamentary committee that looks at these questions of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and ethnic affairs have to be a very big policy area in a country such as ours where something like one-quarter of its population was born overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is an emotional problem to many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a theory that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> adds to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to know that in the past year or so, for a change, the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> question has been removed somewhat from the emotional area and the debate has become much more informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a publication which was recommended to members by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A particular paper presented by Ainsley Jolley was headed The Macro Economics of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is one of the signposts of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> debate and that people are beginning to realise just where and when in the trade cycle <span class="highlight">immigration</span> causes stresses or benefits on employment and other matters such as the balance of payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too often in this place debates on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> become emotional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes people get up and say: ‘If we have an increased level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> we are bound to have to that same extent an increase in the level of unemployment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <span class="highlight">immigration</span> were to be used as a means of economic stabilisation there would be a need to cut <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at the peak of the trade cycle and increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at the beginning of economic recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that is spoken about in this paper is the fact that at the bottom of the trade cycle when there is an excess capacity <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the first instance tends to use up only that excess capacity, so the increased demand from the new immigrants will not add so much to employment levels and, therefore, may add to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though I admit that perhaps at the bottom of the trade cycle <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will add less to demand than it would at the peak, there is a case to be made, perhaps more strongly than even Ainsley Jolley has put it, that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at all stages of the trade cycle will add to demand especially of course at the top of the trade cycle, and that is a time when <span class="highlight">immigration</span> perhaps needs to be cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we are feeling the first very fragile commencement of a very solid movement forward in the Australian economy, now- right now- is, in my view, the time to increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> heavily in the way that it is apparently being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often there is a feeling in the Australian community- certainly this applies in my electorate too- that a low level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a means of cutting back on unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many people forget, however, that a low level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is in many ways a contributor to our present condition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does need to be said that it was the previous Labor Government that apparently did not believe in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Government that cut back the levels of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which made it so difficult for qualified brothers and sisters of migrants already in Australia to enter this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Government that created a situation in which in one year the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia was only about 20,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a steady increase in the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see good and steady increases in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this country as one of the prime methods of getting this country back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very confident that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs sees it that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite wrong for the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Sainsbury)  to suggest that there was anything about the Labor Party when it was in office or in Opposition which could possibly suggest that the Labor Party was against <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or that it was against migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to honourable members that whilst the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations may have faced the facts about unemployment, we see reflected in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs an inability on the part of that Department to face that kind of reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is evidence that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is suggesting that in those circumstances, where we now have 6.2 per cent of the work force unemployed- by the new year, the percentage will be considerably higher- we ought to increase the rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which, I believe, will therefore increase the rate of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The direct effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for two decades (that is, excluding the inflows from Australian born children of migrants) was to contribute at least 40 per cent of the annual increase in the Australian labour force: Indeed in the 1950s the contribution would have been in excess of 50 per cent per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is within that context that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in April of this year, was arguing for increasing the levels of migration from their current net levels of around 50,000 odd to 1 10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes that figure of 27,000 contained in the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in June of this year, well after the parameters of the Budget had been set, and compares it with what the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations said in his statement of Thursday of last week, one finds a great difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs who, in April was advocating 1 10,000 immigrants a year and whose Department has an interest in the highest possible figures, is clearly in conflict with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations who has an interest in the lowest possible figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to a paper recently released by  Dr Birrell  of Monash University, who has drawn attention to the way in which the Minister and his Department have manipulated figures to their own advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Chairman,  I have shown this table to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and I now seek leave to have it incorporated in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The estimates set out in terms of costs Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for the year 1978-79 and the extent of its assistance to ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since World War II our population has accelerated and has become more of a European blend because of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy directed towards getting our skilled workers from that general geographic area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their financial cost to the nation for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was absolutely nothing, but their financial and cultural contribution to Australia today cannot be calculated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been a constructive approach to the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other honourable members have stressed the importance of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a contributor to the economic well-being of the Australian nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member made the statement in fairly direct terms that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> equates with unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He advanced the simplistic argument that if <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is increased, inevitably it will increase unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I can take as a guide the number of representations the honourable member makes to me in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, I am sure that he was not arguing that we should be stopping family reunion migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780921_reps_31_hor110/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, to make sure that before another Bill of this nature is produced for Parliament to scrutinise copies of the legislation, or at least information on its general thrust, will be available to the industry more readily than as happened with this piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter I wish to bring to the attention of the House is the appalling method used by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or its officers at Melbourne Airport to clear passengers who are arriving in Australia or returning to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had been through health clearances in Sydney and I had to go through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and customs clearances in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I bother to raise this matter is that, having had the benefit of visiting a number of countries during my journey to Europe, I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that the worst port in the world for people to get through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> clearances must be Melbourne Airport at Tullamarine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that a lot of unnecessary clerical work was being done on behalf of passengers by the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Only four or five <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers were working at their posts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will probably overshadow what occurred one or two years ago and would cause quite a strain to those persons and would cause great strains on our infrastructure here including our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and our schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Council will possess the necessary powers for local government activities in the village area, and will advise the Government on a broad range of matters affecting the community for example education, health and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I announced recently, in a joint statement with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, Australian citizenship will shortly be available to persons who were ordinarily resident on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands immediately before the transfer of those Islands to Australia on 23 November 1955, who are now ordinarily resident in Australia or an external Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not one of those who believes that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the cause of unemployment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It deals with the question of inequalities, particularly as they relate to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is to speak about inequalities in the Australian society, the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is one area where one should look to find that we are not as egalitarian as we would like to think we are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the fourth category of the new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy announced on May 7 by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, citizens of New Zealand, and Commonwealth and Irish citizens resident in New Zealand, are generally exempt from the requirement to seek prior authority to enter Australia while citizens from other countries have to go through lengthy procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780928_reps_31_hor111/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have seen reports in today’s newspapers which carry a statement from the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs alleging that Australia is laundering the entry of Rhodesians via South Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition spokesman seems to be at a loss to understand the fact that those people coming from the camps in Malaysia and Thailand are put through the process by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers and are given resident status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs does provide language courses for the refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Education are now working closely together and we must hope that they will find solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By the year 2000 we may even have only 17 million or 18 million people, depending on where and when our falling birth rate stabilises and on the net gain from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the coming two decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This makes a mockery of the repeated claims by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that his Government has provided strong and continuing support for child migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am interested to note that the Government is in the process of co-ordinating the results of various programs that have been conducted by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, as well as by departments such as the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Postal and Telecommunications Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that if we were to try to achieve the pre- 1 974 situation in the labour market, we would be looking towards an increasing labour force as a result of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of some 20,000 people a year, a return to the pre- 1974 trend in female participation rates, which is considerably below what it is now, no change in the participation of young people and education in the work force, respectively, and no normal additional participation following an increase in the demand for labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781019_reps_31_hor111/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am grateful to the honourable member for referring to my initiative before the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees but, of course, there have been other proposals, and I refer to both the interest of the Opposition and particularly the endeavours made by my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in association on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at the other basic omission from the statement- the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely we would hope that this Minister would have the capacity to produce something a little stronger than the cold and pious answer the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  gave me last Wednesday when he said that he would ‘react positively and humanely to situations which may occur’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not the case that the Australian High Commissioner there is not able to process <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cases without bringing staff” from Athens? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has misled the Australian public and his own Cabinet colleagues over the Government’s declared policy of a net target of 70,000 settlers this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 7 June the Minister stated that for 1977-78 ‘a gross intake of around 77,000 is expected to yield a net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of about 70,000’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has manipulated the figures for the last year to create the illusion that net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was 70,000 persons when in fact it fell well below this level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing this the Minister has been able to manipulate the figures to create the illusion that he was not increasing the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Government has increased its net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target by over 25 per cent at a time of still increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By including in the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> figures people already in Australia who were granted a change of status, the Minister seems to be saying that last year some 10,000 to 15,000 visitors were permitted to become permanent residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such action would make a mockery of the Government’s selected <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 7 June the Minister condemned the use of visitor entry to circumvent the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and claimed to be tightening up on such activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this new policy is as successful as the one that the Government followed last year we can expect our net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake to be around 85,000 persons, which is a significant increase on the stated target of 70,000 new settlers as permanent Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781024_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average time per passenger for completion of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Quarantine and some Customs formalities was 1.3 minutes but with such a peak of arrivals delay for some was inevitable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781025_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-32-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the tabling of the report of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs last week, honourable members will be aware that in Australia at the present time there is a considerable number of people who fall into the category of prohibited or illegal migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were informed of serious delays caused by the need to refer minor matters to numerous coordinating bodies in Canberra, including the Public Service Board, the Department of Finance, the Department of Administrative Services and on occasions various interdepartmental committees, as well as major parent departments such as Foreign Affairs, Trade and Resources and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following publicity given last year to claims that large numbers of Papua-New Guineans were entering and residing illegally in the Torres Strait area and northern Queensland an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> task force visited the area on a number of occasions and found the claims to be greatly exaggerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781121_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was the Labor Government which effectively dismantled the old National Labour Advisory Council because the then Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> believed that he knew more about industrial relations than anybody else and it was not necessary to have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-On 7 June 1978 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  made a statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which held out considerable promise in the field of family reunion for the ethnic communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790307_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the long term, the consequences of the loss of this human potential and potential consumer demand will be reflected in fewer employment opportunities in this country unless we are prepared to engage in a massive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to try to fill this great land of ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not enough for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and his counterpart in New Zealand to set up departmental inquiries and then make the assessment that because approximately 400,000 people travel between the two countries we should ignore the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I see things with the considerable wordly experience which I have, the legislation is intended to tighten our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws relating to passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar):  If he is concerned about human rights and civil liberties- I confess that it is an area that has never bothered me- how many people have really suffered? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-by leave-The role of the professionally qualified migrants who have come to this country is both acknowledged and appreciated; but, as the Committee itself on Overseas Professional Qualifications in its 10th report tabled today by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  points out, many matters have changed rather radically since the Committee was established in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790403_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In many respects it is probably more heart-rending than the decisions that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has to make about families who have settled here, have had children born here, and then, having exceeded their right of residency, are deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 2 1 years since the Migration Act was passed the character of the Australian community has markedly changed, with radical amendment to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and in the volume and nature of movements into and out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately, there are some who enter or remain illegally in Australia, regarding breaches of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws and policies as offences of small significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clearly, people who try to evade <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls should gain no advantage over those many others who, being also ineligible to migrate to Australia, are prepared to abide by the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for settlement is relatively low, with an emphasis on encouraging only those skills in short supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, I draw the attention of honourable members to the Minister’s statement, ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population’, of 7 June 1978 which emphasised the Government’s recognition of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a necessary element in economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are pursuing a longterm approach to population building in which <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the only directable factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Australian community is now barely reproducing itself must recommend an effective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and program to all persons who genuinely have the future welfare of this nation in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relatively low volume of admission for settlement in more recent years inevitably prompts attempts to circumvent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and procedures either by malpractice or by entering for allegedly temporary purposes but then staying on without authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A visa is a document or notation specifically in the form of a stamped impression in a passport which informs the carrier company and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer at the port of arrival in Australia that the holder, prima facie, may enter Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The search for persons who breach the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> law is an expensive and an unwanted burden on the Australian taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that on 10 August 1978 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs announced that from that date prohibited immigrants who had been deported from Australia for any reason would be barred from re-entering Australia for a period of five years, except in the most compelling circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of these provisions arose out of the recommendations of a management review which reported on its investigation of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and procedures in July of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government believes that the Bill will provide for a considerable increase in control capacity while new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation is being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indonesia’s continuing help in forestalling unheralded arrivals of refugees is very much appreciated, for it is much easier for Australia to take in a significant number of refugees, I believe, when this is done in an orderly way and under proper <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures and not arriving unheralded on our coastline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs  (Mr Adermann)  who is listening to this debate would say that there is, in fact, very little difference in what the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been saying about the way the Australian Government ought to respond to refugees and what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  himself has been saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790524_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs whether the Government will take early action to follow up the breakthrough achieved last week by  Mr Hawke  in his discussions with Soviet authorities on Soviet dissidents and Jewish emigration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have been in constant discussion with the Australian- Jewish welfare societies and the Federal Catholic <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790528_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is presently contributing some 20 per cent of tradesmen entering the Australian workforce and given the known willingness and suitability of thousands of young Australians to undertake trade training, one would imagine that any rational and sane government would be committing itself to a major reorganisation of trade training and financial support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790530_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of this inquiry, the SubCommittee heard evidence from a number of departments, in particular, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, Primary Industry and Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are exotic animal and plant diseases and illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from Papua New Guinea to the Torres Strait Islands and eventually to mainland Australia is a well-known practice, and one which poses a major risk of disease entering Australia through animals brought into Australian territory by Papua New Guineans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Committee heard evidence from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on this question last August, the Department has taken measures to identify Papua New Guineans living illegally in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Committee was pleased to hear recently that the Department is now confident that the situation is under control, it believes that this control must be continued and strengthened through expanding the number of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers permanently stationed in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will be aware of inquiries from individuals and the community anxious to assist in the support, housing, settlement and adoption of refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790604_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few weeks ago the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  and I criticised the long delay in concluding lower air fares arrangements to Greece and Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This 80 per cent will not include usage in collecting refugees, as announced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  this week; nor will it include usage for overseas personalities such as British royalty, heads of state from friendly countries and other official guests who come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790605_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I should like to elaborate on three matters mentioned in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  concerning matters within the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my statement of 7 June 1978 to the House on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, I indicated that while other temporary residents would no longer be eligible for permanent resident status while in Australia, private overseas students would continue to be eligible for permanent residence pending the review of the private overseas student policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- In general, I do not think that we have very much to criticise in a large part of the substance of the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As announced by the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  on 21 August in the Budget Speech, the Government has decided to introduce charges to recover certain administrative costs currently incurred by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Europe and North America it is usual to charge for a wide array of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and consular services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the Minister is empowered to appoint only officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, Customs officers and members of the Commonwealth, State and Territory Police Forces as authorised officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These appointments will be made only in those situations where Australia is not represented in the particular overseas country or where officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs are not employed at overseas posts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790822_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of the day, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  is quoted as saying that anyone refusing a reasonable offer of a job would be disqualified from receiving the unemployment benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this investigation is what the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  had in mind earlier today when he made the curious claim that  Mr Urbanchich  should be regarded as innocent until proved guilty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the bland indifference of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs today represent the attitude of this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are entitled to know how he came to escape the screening of Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter was raised at Question Time this morning when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  said that  Mr Urbanchich  was now an Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>9 on national income and expenditure, the wages share of gross domestic product at factor cost is 60.4 per cent after adjustment for changes in work force composition as outlined by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in its publication entitled: Share of the National Product’ which was published in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before discussing in detail those aspects of the Budget which relate to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I wish to refer to the Galbally report for the purpose of reminding honourable members of some of the points in it relating to the expenditure in which the Government is indulging in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time under the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, there is a reduction of $600,000 for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In sum total then, the outlays for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs amounted to $65m last year and $73.4m this year- an increase of $8.4m, which is not much above the inflation rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason the Leader of the Opposition has seen fit to embark upon ethnic Press conferences, presumably because he has taken note of the comments of some members of the ethnic media who have described his shadow minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a likeable but incompetent shadow minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also failed to differentiate between the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and the refugee program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must remember that the Labor Party is the party which slashed and for all practical purposes cut out <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in 1 973 or 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also abolished the separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and created the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last 200 years, except for brief periods of war and economic recession, Australia has been a country of large-scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has succeeded in maintaining social harmony and national cohesion throughout this period of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that I tabled in the House on 7 June 1979 a paper entitled Multiculturalism and its Implications for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will consist of a  chairman,  the director of the Institute, the Secretary to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and not fewer than three, or more than six, other members appointed by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Future policies will need to account for this development unless the birth rate increases- I suppose that is unlikely- or we adopt a deliberate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy aimed at bringing young people into the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even such an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy would have difficulty in effecting a ‘younging’ of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To some extent at least that would counteract any attempt to introduce younger people into the community through a deliberate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also provides thoughtful, informed and some very trenchant views on the policy options available to Australia on crucial matters: How we should adjust to the rapid economic growth now taking place to our north; how we should conduct our relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations; how far our interests coincide with general Western interests in relation to the Third World; what our posture should be in the United Nations and other international forums; what principles should inform our policies on such matters as aid, human rights, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to believe that significant modification to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy could occur only some time in 1966? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time Australia indicated that it was ready to deal with the non-aligned and with Asia and Africa on their own terms, without racial discrimination in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and without overriding military preoccupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I arranged with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to see Vietnamese refugees who had recently arrived in camp in Hong Kong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From these figures tables are produced which project the labour force under various assumptions, including constant participation rates as of August 1978 and projected participation rates from long term trends and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> assumptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a surprisingly large ambit of authority under the Broadcasting and Television Act going well beyond that directly related to ethnic radio and television and, most surprisingly of all, is administered not by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications but rather by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Act the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs controls the Special Broadcasting Service in a way which is in flagrant conflict with any notion of independence for that Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have this Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  exercising such authority is as reassuring as having Bluebeard for a babysitter or holding a promissory note from Alfred Zion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the very thing about which ethnic people complain and which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  denies- the two SEBAC and NEBAC are regarded as being virtually and completely out of touch with ethnic communities; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the Australian Broadcasting Commission it is directly under the control and has to respond to the behest and to deflect to the whims of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, it is not a very reassuring accommodation to be in the hands of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Special Broadcasting Service has been taken away from him, much to his resentment, and it is in the hands of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is not gracing the table today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the views of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that we would have preferred to hear on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>defending an apparent challenge for control of ethnic broadcasting by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, Michael MacKellar, whose hard-line tactics haven’t endeared him to immigrant communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The SBS is prone to the continued whim not so much of the Minister who ought to be responsible but of the Prime Minister and his Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Telephone calls from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs have disrupted meetings which the Executive Director of the SBS has held with his officers over the nature of the ethnic television service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is striking that many of the people associated with ethnic broadcasting and many of those appointed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to the advisory bodies, the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council and the State Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council, are very prominent members of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, he gave the wrong figures for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, he confused the figures for net and gross <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr HAYDEN (Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)- In relation to the matter which the honourable member for St George raised and to which I responded, may we take it as a sort of ditto’ comment in my explanation of a Press statement released by the Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 1 1 September, taking the very same line that the honourable member for St George took. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, in the administration of the numerical multifactor assessment system of determining eligibility for permanent entry into Australia, takes fully into account the occupational needs of industry in Australia as one of the basic factors of the NUMAS scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At no time in Australia’s history has there been such a wide range of achievements in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs as there has since the beginning of 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following an extensive review of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies in the context of Australia’s population, new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and population objectives were announced on 7 June last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy with denned objectives over rolling three-year periods; we have relaxed family reunion entry categories in a responsible way; we have introduced new opportunities for independent applicants to be considered for migration under a systematic selection system known as NUMAS, which is based on the collective experience of settlement in this country over many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in the Government believe that a continuing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is a crucial element in policies and programs for the advancement of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe also that we must link the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake with effective post-arrival settlement programs so that the process of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is one that is satisfying and productive to migrants themselves and to the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is essential expenditure to ensure that adequate information is available to decision-makers in the Australian community for resource allocation, for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> planning and for use by those who have to plan and carry through services to the community as a whole and to elements within the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More than 20 years ago when Australia was going through a difficult period of unemployment and economic problems, there was a clamour from some people that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be cut or that it should stop completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately, good sense prevailed and a majority of Australians, not only supporters of the Government of the day but also leaders of the trade union movement, recognised the importance of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia’s development and economic well-being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Planned <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, based on the need to maintain a balanced program, both ethnically and industrially, continued to lead us into the prosperous 1960s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attitudes, especially of some sections within the Opposition in more recent times, are reminiscent of those calls for reduced <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in 1956 and 1957. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs policies have been stated in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ALP’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is a very imprecise one but it does say that family reunion must have a high priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a statement on a new approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and community relations, the Opposition spokesman said that family reunion is a concept that includes: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no clarification in recent Press releases from the Opposition spokesman on <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a pity that in a debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> the Opposition should have descended to the sort of level where the Opposition hovers around waiting for innocuous pieces of paper, in some instances early Departmental drafts, to become available as the basis for unintelligible Press releases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a feeling of pride in referring to the achievements in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs portfolio since the beginning of 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year’s Budget gives additional funds and resources to enable a continuation of a positive approach to <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs policies and programs are based on Australia’s interests, compassion for our fellow men and women and playing a responsible role in the international arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Officers of theDepartment of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and Business and Consumer Affairs stepping up at departure points identification checks of children who are accompanied by only one parent; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-31-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the recommendations- it is interesting because the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, is responsible for this particular area- that was not accepted by the Government was the ultimate purpose for which the departure tax should be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently I now have no gripe with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs regarding that particular aspect of the Committee ‘s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who has been to Europe, will agree that what is shown on that map is a Third World country, namely Malta, is in fact Sicily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also refer to a document dealing with news reports of relevance to migrants which was produced by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yesterday, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  stated that most people did not appreciate how population growth has slowed down in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Lalor named the coordinator of the Turkish program, a  Mr Arthur  Inchehara, claimed that he had been an unsuccessful preselection candidate for the New South Wales Liberal Party Senate ticket, and also claimed that he had been appointed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  because he was politically safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790926_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- The statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  was a long and beautifully worded statement which I am sure sounded marvellous to those listening to the broadcast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the policy of this Government has been to centralise all these things back into the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, which is quite contrary to the spirit of the Galbally proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He points out that different languages seem to raise enormous problems in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not comment in detail at this stage because there is legislation before the House, other than to say that because of the way in which it is drafted, with all due respect to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, it is tokenism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790927_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Holding)  will oppose that provision, but I am sure that his colleague, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the former Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is so assiduously preparing something here, because of his experience at an earlier time must, without doubt, recognise that there is a very great need for action to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These standards are developed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs after consultation with the Department of Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791009_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 September 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I refer the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to an explanation he gave on 30 August this year in which he said that migrants coming to Australia fell into four categories- family reunion, refugees, those entering by virtue of the Tasman agreement and persons who were selected because of their occupational skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I affirm the statement that I made to my Federal Member of Parliament and which he repeated in Parliament; namely: I have never had an official letter or communication from the Department of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> concerning my husband’s deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Towards the end of1977, I was contacted by a  Mr Belford  of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Melbourne, with a view to determining whether or not I would be prepared to have my husband return to myself and our family upon his release. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was also told that there was a letter from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department saying that a deportation order was pending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I affirm the statement that I made to my Federal Member of Parliament and which he repeated in Parliament, namely: I have never had an official letter or communication from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> concerning my husband’s deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It merely declares the position of the woman and her relationship with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not universally accepted practice that the departments of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of various countries charge clients- or applicants for visas to visit those countries- for the processing of the various forms and applications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insofar as there is now a significant component in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> welfare program which is really directed at and for refugees, one could claim that immigrants generally will be paying for their own postarrival welfare and for that of refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has pointed out that the charges will apply, for the most part, to persons who are Australian residents but not Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience has shown doubtful qualifications of many selection officers in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> posted overseas in terms of their limited education and their limited crosscultural experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, one is tempted to ask whether this is an echo- and if so, one hopes it is a very faint echo- of the restricted <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act by which tests in any language were used to exclude applicants for visas to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the United Kingdom and the United States of America have adopted the practice of trying to recoup costs that it is possible to identify as being directly associated with a request from a person using the services of their <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791011_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs attempt to make dual nationals aware of the problems they might encounter on return to their country of birth or ethnic origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report of the Joint Committee was referred to an interdepartmental committee drawn from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand that the interdepartmental committee consisted of officers from the Department of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Department of the AttorneyGeneral, and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among other things, in the file  Senator Murphy  discovered that there had been a secret meeting among officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General’s Department, his own Department and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet at which these officers had decided that they would inform  Senator Murphy  that his answer to a question relating to Croatian terrorism should be in the form of a lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 24 September 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4472  (Hansard,  25 September 1979, page 1530) concerning the necessity for the use of the English language in incoming passenger cards and outgoing passenger cards, is it a fact that the words ‘The card must be completed in the English language’ appear on the back of each card and that the instructions are printed in the English language alone which might give rise to an inference that no other language will be understood by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While English is the official language in Australia and presumably is the official language in Great Britain, is he able to say whether the British <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities do not regard it as necessary to say that it is compulsory for British <span class="highlight">immigration</span> forms to be filled in in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4472, have <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials ever complained that passengers have in practice made their tasks difficult by the use of native scripts; if so, what were the native scripts in question and in what way would the answers to questions 1 to 9 and 1 1 and 12 on the exit form and questions 1 to 9 and 1 1 and 13 on the entry form differ if they were written in a language other than English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-It is scandalous that the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs now plays a secondary role to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the make-up of Australia’s labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We already have substantially high unemployment in this country and many of those people who are coming to Australia today under the present system of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will also be unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A charge of misleading the Parliament and the Australian electorate is not one taken lightly by the Opposition, but departmental documents prove conclusively that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  have deliberately attempted to mislead the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the introduction of NUMAS the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs have consistently claimed that this situation has not altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the Parliament on 11 October stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I met with my equivalent in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that NUMAS was adopted to boost the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which had been cut back severely by an absolute lack of job vacancies in Australia for the Australian born and the overseas born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of the approved list of occupations published by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and based on the predictions of ‘Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation ‘ shows that while there are some localised shortages of labour in some States, there are very few shortages of labour Australiawide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an official from the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs has said, a lack of work opportunities in Australia prompted the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to introduce NUMAS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> wants a larger migrant intake and it will go to any lengths to achieve it, no matter what the employment consequences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence in our possession shows that NUMAS is biased in favour of rich, white English-speaking middle class immigrants from Rhodesia and the USA, while at the same time significantly weakening the family reunion aspect of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had discussions with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and senior officers of my Department have also had discussions to keep the operation of NUMAS under close review in this field of supplying the labour market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is no longer a program where, except for the refugee and family reunion categories, labour market considerations are the prime considerations in determining entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, while that is not the situation, representations you receive alleging conflicts between the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and Australia’s labour market situation are best answered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have in any case tended more and more to seek to transfer those kinds of representations (previously answered by this Department) to <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as NUMAS has developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A further report, commenting on the Government’s proposed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake of 210,000 in the triennium 1978-81, says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ‘rather perplexed’ at the formula- ‘growing unemployment, therefore increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It asks: ‘What is the point of increasing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> when in Australia and throughout the world recession is on the increase? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This phasing out of skilled <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, 8,000 to 10,000 a year, and the projected increase in the demand for skilled labour, 10,000 a year, would require an increase of 20,000 a year on current apprenticeship intakes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a scandalous situation we have reached in Australia and it is about time that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment were either merged or the Ministers were forced by the Executive to meet regularly to see what the demands of the labour market are in Australia and to see that people are not just brought here to boost the ranks of the unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, what we have just heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  is one of the most damaging indictments of Australian Labor Party policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that I have ever heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that if we were going to talk about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> it would have been the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who would have raised the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps he is going to take over the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at this total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake because it bears close scrutiny if we are to analyse just exactly what goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the immediate effects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> might be to raise the unemployment numbers in particular categories of labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general evidence from Australia ‘s own history as well as the post-war histories of European countries which absorbed vast numbers of guest workers and immigrants, is that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> does not - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice, high <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been associated with booming economies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be argued that the economic booms cause the <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, not vice versa, But, it is clear that the migrant flows did not destroy the booms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own view is that increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at this time would probably act as a valuable stimulus to the economy, yielding widespread benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies are unclear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly obvious from listening to the lame speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that he has at least found his own level of incompetence in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that there has been a huge cover-up in this Parliament involving the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to obscure differences of opinion between the departments and their Ministers as to the effects of independent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that until 1 January <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy covered these categories: Family reunion, special family reunion, refugees, persons freely granted residence because of the Tasman agreement, and the general eligibility provision wherein independent new migrants were selected mainly by relating their skills to the Australian 1 mainly abour market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that there has been a significant change, it is proper to ask what the attitude of the other department involved was, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, and whether the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs worked in unity to implement this new program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were far from satisfied with the final decisions and the former Secretary wrote to the Secretary of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in August 1978 setting out our objections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I with my equivalent in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department following the Cabinet Decision to clarify the procedure for operation of NUMAS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, this is what the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs thinks about the activities of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You would need to ask the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that this question has been raised today because it gives me the opportunity to explain away some of the misconceptions which presently exist regarding the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy- misconceptions which seem to be shared by honourable members opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to start by saying that last week when the Estimates Committee was looking into the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs it was made clear that it is too early to make the kind of judgment on the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System which the honourable members opposite are presently trying to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage we do not have any clear indication from the settler arrival statistics of what the precise impact of the various categories of the new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think honourable members opposite would do well to examine the NUMAS points system in detail, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has outlined it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  should also examine the principles of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which are followed by this Government and which were presented to the House by the Minister last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clearly is the basis of NUMAS and the basis for the administration of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members opposite are concerned about relationships between <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and unemployment, they should have a close look at their own party’s policy in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the bulk of the Opposition’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake would not be related to labour market considerations at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strange that the Opposition, when in office, brought <span class="highlight">immigration</span> levels to the lowest point on record and did away with a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, incorporating that Department with the Department of Labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it would promise an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake comprised mainly of those people who would be competing for jobs at the most competitive end of the labour market, that is the unskilled area, or the area where there is no specific occupational demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party never seems to accept that there are positive employment aspects to a sensibly controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> provides us with a labour force mobility which would not otherwise exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> also overcomes leads and lags in our domestic retraining schemes, which we do not underestimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has already pointed out, for skilled workers entering employment, additional jobs are created for semi-skilled and unskilled workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> means a greater demand for housing, consumer durables and other goods and services produced in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rightly points out that it is illogical to concentrate attention on the effects of migration on the supply of labour, especially during recession, without admitting the demand-creating features of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general evidence from Australia’s own history as well as the post-war histories of European countries which absorbed vast numbers of guest workers and immigrants, is that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> does not increase unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My own view is that increased <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at this time would probably act as a valuable stimulus to the economy, yielding widespread benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The explanation for this Bill is not contained in the second reading speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  but rather in the ministerial statement made by him on 22 August 1979- or should I say that in that statement we find the excuse for this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the real justification for this Bill is to raise money to offset increased expenditure on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791018_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In response to the statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 22 August I made the following comment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the students claim that they are advised by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to apply for permanent residence visas when they seek to stay here in order to gain work experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  announced the new criteria for admission, which requires a high academic ability on behalf of the student and the future utility of the intended qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee received a disappointing three page submission from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of that, Ministers, such as my friend, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who always pays a great deal of attention to us, at the beginning of the next budgetary year should bring their estimates before the Estimates committees and say: ‘This is what we propose to do.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a general observation, let me say that I believe that, our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is administered very fairly by a Minister who looks at cases impartially and tries to do the best he can for all the people who seek to bring in friends and relatives from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last Thursday, I asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  what progress had been made in bringing those 600 people to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A spokesman for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr MacKellar,  said there had been ‘some delays in arranging the mechanics’ of the visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, a visit of an Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team to Indonesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia was reported in an Indonesian newsletter late last year as saying that his Government did not object to anyone leaving Timor who wanted to, providing he went through the normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were not met, apparently, because of difficulties of the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team getting into East Timor to carry out interviews, to do the normal processing which is required of anyone who wants to come to Australia, and because various difficulties were put in the way of people wishing to come out of East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Correspondence that I received subsequently from the then Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, expressed expectations that the program of reuniting families would take place expeditiously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in a letter dated 3 April 1 979 wrote: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was drawn to my attention when I recently saw a handout from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in which articles from the ethnic press are summarised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791024_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-33-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All authorities were established by statute as independent advisory bodies to Government and, except for the Canada Employment and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Commission, all functioned independently of Government Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some authorities, in addition to their advisory role, had the responsibility to undertake executive action in the administration of programs- Canada Employment and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Commission, the Federal Employment Institute (the Federal Republic of Germany) and Manpower Services Commission (the United Kingdom). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other areas we have been able to prove- I ask honourable members opposite to look at the  Hansard  for Estimates Committee B- the enormous conflict between the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs about the criteria being used for allowing migrants to come into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of the introduction of passport controls or similar controls between Australia and New Zealand has been under scrutiny for a long time, as the honourable member would know from when he was Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was raised again at the most recent meeting of Australian Ministers concerned with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, which was also attended by the New Zealand Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government was not a party to any sponsorship of candidates and the involvement of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was related only to the grant of visas for persons associated with the staging of the event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791106_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mrs Chan advised that she applied to the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities in Sydney for a further six months extension visa on 25 July 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has informed me that she sent her Hong Kong identity card to the Sydney <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Office on 3 August 1978, addressed to a Miss Sacharczuk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I honestly believe that they have the sympathy of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is carefully considering their case at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have implicit faith and I believe every other member of the Opposition has implicit faith in the integrity and honesty of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not have the same faith in the staff of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The threat is more acute in those cases where there has been large-scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of ethnic Russians, such as in Latvia, whose people and language have already been overwhelmed in the main cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we saw it, the Institute would document the phenomenon of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to our country, trace and comment on the growth of ethnic communities, sponsor crosscultural awareness, help preserve the heritage of our ethno-cultural society, promote mutual tolerance and esteem between all groups and investigate cross-cultural experiences, lifestyles and needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Vernon Committee, way back in the past, had views about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but felt contrained to support the policy of the then Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not allowed to make comments on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in relation to economic affairs, although I understand that in the substance of its report it stated that it was not able to conclude that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in fact gave rise to the economic benefits that were so loudly touted at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Secretary to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for the Opposition, the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass),  made a number of criticisms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I generally take the view that he does try to conduct debates on the matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs in a relatively bipartisan manner, I felt that some of his criticisms were nit picking- if I can describe them as suchand really did not get to the substance of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment put forward by the Opposition then states that the Bill ought to be redrafted in order to elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The whole issue of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is one which has some accord politically and, indeed, throughout Australia at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very much in character with the founder of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy,, the late Arthur Calwell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all parliamentarians with any knowledge and experience about these things will concede that he was very forward looking when, as Labor Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, he initiated this program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unity ticket now, having had that creative work done way back in the early post-war years, is to give effect to the spirit of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and to make the passage and pathway for our migrant people more easy or reasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an enormous phenomenon of our time that three and a half million people from 100 countries have come to our country, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to the clarion call he issued yesterday, calling on Australian women to procreate or perish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the Leader of the Opposition’s rather snide introduction to the question, let me say that yesterday I was talking about the future population of Australia, the effect of the fertility trends which are now present in the population, the likely fertility trends in the future, the contribution that people born in Australia can make to population growth and also the contribution that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can make to population growth in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is why I have asked the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council to have a look at matters of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The sad thing about it is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  when Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, implied that really most of the losses had occurred during the civil war between the Fretilin and the Democratic Union of Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Child and Adult Migrant Education Programs- From 1970-71 until 1973-74 both the Child and Adult Migrant Education Programs were administered by the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> with the Department of Education (Education and Science until the end of 1972) providing consultative advisory and servicing functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-11">[More…]</a></p>
