  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> refers to a report in today’s Canberra Times’ which says that Lady Crawford, the wife of a former Governor of Uganda, was refused permission to stay in Britain when she flew in for medical treatment last night because her husband,  Sir Frederick  Crawford, had his British passport confiscated in 1967 by the British Government on the ground that he supported the Smith regime in Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is right and proper that he should do so, but I think it is also right thatI should take that case to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister still accepts the concept of a bi-partisan approach by the major Australian political parties to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, why were Opposition parliamentarians excluded from functions convened by the Minister and other ministerial colleagues to honour the visiting Yugoslav Minister for Labor,  Mr Anton  Polajnar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This consideration will involve other Ministers such as the Foreign Minister and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply refer to the acceptable occupations list which I am sure  Senator Mulvihill  is aware does exist in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the facts that  Senator Mulvihill  has given, his applicant does fit within the occupational test and I can say only that I will refer the specific application to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and endeavour to have some assistance given to the applicant in the manner that the honourable senator has outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister can elucidate upon this point for me: During the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee E last year, the then Secretary of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr McKenzie,  indicated that the then Government was creating an authority of nine persons more or less to ensure and protect the professional recognition of translators and interpreters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those courses were funded initially by the then Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the understanding that the funding would be picked up in the education triennium and funded forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That officer had to read the Minister’s statement on the matter and to consult with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs before he knew the cut-off point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I will content myself with moving that motion because I find myself in a position similar to that of  Senator Grimes,  in that we are on the verge of considering the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I simply ask that there be conveyed to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  a request for a stay of proceedings on a deportation order against a Bolivian citizen, Roger Guttierrez, until the union and I can prepare a case to submit to the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Government give consideration to the suggestion of the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Whitlam Government, the Honourable Clyde Cameron, M.P., supported by his New Zealand ministerial counterpart, that a cheap identity card, as distinct from a passport, be introduced, which would prevent entry of undesirable persons on both sides of the Tasman Sea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not wish in any way to confine the adjournment debate to one  speaker,  but I want to respond to  Senator Mulvihill  and to assure him that I will bring these two cases to the notice of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 30 August 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 12 of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Education Act 1971, I present a report entitled ‘Child Migrant Education 1978-79’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to speak about clause 6 because it touches on the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 17 August 1977,  Senator Guilfoyle  explained to the Senate which alleged injustices under the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act could go before the Ombudsman and which ones could go before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My prime purpose for raising this matter is to say that although these amendments are innocuous they may not be so innocuous when taken in conjunction with recent amendments to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect, will the people with resident status or Australian citizens who are alleging that there have been <span class="highlight">immigration</span> injustices have access to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, whereas the illegal migrant or the person who has overstayed will have to go to the Ombudsman? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  implemented deportation orders against five people and that in one case the Administrative Appeals Tribunal disallowed the recommendation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that, notwithstanding the enlargement of the holding processes, there is nothing in this Bill that will stop the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs going to a higher body- in effect, the Federal Court of Australia- so that even if a person feels that he has vindicated himself under the legislation before us there is nothing to stop the Minister from having another bite of the cherry and going to the Federal Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that sections 12, 13, and 14 of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act provide for this but to me, as a layman, it seemed to be part of a jigsaw puzzle in that when one gets to the last piece and tries to force it in one finds that the whole lot comes asunder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving aside some of the more involved issues which I probably cannot comprehend, I have raised this matter to be sure that the position in relation to the eligibility of people in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> field- that is, the division between clients of the Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal- has not been changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These refer, in the main, to procedures laid down by the Convention for dealing with offenders, and cover such matters as the detention of offenders, ihe conducting of enquiries, reporting to governments concerned, and the application, for purposes of deportation, of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws to offenders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The agreement was signed in Canberra on the 12th February by  Mr Anton  Polajnar  President  of the Federal Council of Labour of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia, on behalf of the Yugoslav Government and by my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  on behalf of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been assured by the Yugoslav delegation that these formalities will be put in hand immediately and that migration under the agreement should commence shortly thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preliminary discussions leading up to the agreement were held in Canberra and Belgrade between representatives of the two governments, including a thorough discussion on main principles by my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden),  when as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, he visited Belgrade in December 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian delegation comprised representatives of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Department of External Affairs, Attorney-General’s Department, Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Social Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the usual practice on agreements affecting <span class="highlight">immigration</span> the text of the Agreement was referred to all six State governments and each signified that it had no objection to the signature of the agreement as proposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been basic to Australia’s post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that the right to determine who may be admitted to Australia for permanent settlement rests with Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with all countries from which migrants are taken, Yugoslavia has a legitimate and reasonable interest in the number and occupational categories of those moving to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking in my capacity of  Chairman  of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, I would like to say - 1 am sure that the Leader of the Opposition knows this - that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has set up a committee of considerable ability to go into the whole matter of the recognition of professional qualifications and trade abilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking recently at the Australian Citizenship Convention, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  pointed out that the committee set up by the Government has already made considerable progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope to discuss this situation with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  and I hope to be reassured by him that the fears which these people have expressed to me may not be justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Government upon this <span class="highlight">immigration</span> agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the agreement imposes a responsibility upon us as  Senator Dame  Annabelle Rankin, who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  in this chamber, well realises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we are dealing in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters with people, and the sooner we can re-unite families the better it will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rather feel that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and other people should show a greater sophistication towards this problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also I have received from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  information on the numbers of Maltese citizens who have entered Australia as settlers during the years 1965 to 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addressing a question yesterday to the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch),  I pointed out that this matter was raised as long ago as January 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are continuing and perhaps improving on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy started by a Labor government under the guidance of the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  in 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that, in mentioning this case, I am fortified by two communications from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  that are germane to this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a communication to me dated 24th February 1970, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> states that the Minister may grant or refuse an application for naturalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one of the letters to me, the Minister quotes the first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - an illustrious Minister - the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second communication from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, dated 2nd March 1970, which was in reply to a series of questions whichI asked him about Spanish migrants and the protection of their rights, he pointed out: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the point that I pose to the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)  who represents here the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But a number of groups have protested on various domestic matters which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> says, in the second document that I have incorporated in Hansard, are not matters for the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fairness to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I should say that, when interviewed on that programme, he answered: I have only been Minister for a little while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My point about this case is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> states in his letter: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I looked at a general screed on the functions of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I found that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was responsible for alien registration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not criticising the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reading the notice paper I am intrigued to see that two questions do not appear on it - one that I asked the Minister for Housing as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> three or four days ago, and another one that I asked the Leader of the Government on Thursday last, I think it was, in regard to the cost of liquefied petroleum gas in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the light of the decision of his colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to transport the bulk of future European migrants to Australia by air, I ask: Will Qantas Airways Ltd share the increased charter flights with various European airlines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700408_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the problems is that jumbo jets carry a tremendous complement of passengers, and facilities for clearing passengers through customs, health and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> areas naturally are not as advanced in some airports as they are in the major centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, like the passport and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities of other countries, is continuously studying means of preventing malpractice in the issue of passport and Other matters, lt is necessary however to avoid subjecting the great majority of innocent travellers to unreasonable precautions and inconvenience for the sake of increasing marginally the chances of detecting the malpractice of a few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely, from what she has already said the action of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is largely influenced by considerations as to what has happened between the husband and the wife and the position of the children, and not merely by the misrepresentation and entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In these days of great movement of people and the tremendous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that has taken place persons who may be in the Third and Fourth Divisions and transfer from the lower to the higher grade may come to the Commonwealth Public Service endowed with a multiplicity of qualifications from an enormous number of institutes of learning in all parts of the world - perhaps different language institutes from one country or another - and it is a question whether the qualifications of the technical institute of education in X city and Y country are comparable with those of a similar level of education in Australia and whether they could properly be accepted in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of skilled workers, and with new developments to increase the work force by the greater use of married women, the Government is doing its best to cope with a work force situation which is, in the words of the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  during the course of his Budget Speech becoming ‘very tight’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The letters could refer to an urgent social services case, an urgent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> case, any other domestic matter or perhaps a matter of national importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I enter into this debate mainly to discuss the reasons which were given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  for his refusal to allow  Mr Gregory  to enter this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The article quotes the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as having said that people were not prevented from entering Australia just because their political views differed from those of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has refused to allow a man to come here to talk to Australians because he would disturb the morale of the Australian troops in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that we would all support an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which provides that people with criminal records should not be admitted as immigrants to our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  has clearly indicated the basis upon which the Government has refused admission to  Mr Gregory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian position is, and has been for many years, that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has a right to say who may enter Australia and who may not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The power which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> possesses is a power which is exercised - and I suspect it is exercised far more frequently - in the United Stales of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In effect, it has not recognised the existence of families; rather it has tended to place importance on large scale and expensive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes and deprive Australia of the best source of population - that is the children born in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Lim,  as is mentioned in that particular communication - there are other communications in this file which I will make available to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> if it is anxious to look at it again - spent a number of years in this country, has reached a standard of education well in excess of matriculation standard, holds down a responsible job, has a brother in this country married to an Australian girl, has a home to which he can come, has a job to which he can come, and yet he is refused entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But because he is of Chinese descent, the white Australia policy and all the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> bars that one could think of are applied to him.I respectfully request that each of these three cases be reviewed and justice granted to each of the three persons concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> seen a report that a British advertising agency is being employed on an account of $856,000 a year from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and that its 2 executives are regarded as the hidden persuaders behind Australia’s campaign for more British migrants? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> make surveys of such restaurant requirements and balance them against applications lodged in Hong Kong for replacements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to an answerI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I point out that over the weekend a Press report spoke of a considerable fall-off of 15 per cent in the number of British migrants - described as the cornerstone of the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy - coming to Australia in the last 10 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the substantial influence that the British migrant has had on the balance of Australia’s overall <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy will the Minister advise the Senate at the earliest possible opportunity what measures are being taken to ascertain why there is such a large fall-off in the balance of immigrants and at the same time inquire into the cause of the large figure of 27,000 people who emigrated from this country in one year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Has the Australian Government given any consideration to changing Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and laws as a result of pressure by Japanese companies with financial interests in Australia to allow Japanese immigrants into this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will recall that last week I directed a question to her about the decision of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to appoint a British advertising agency, on an account of some $830,000, to sell Australia to prospective British migrants, and that I asked why an Australian advertising agency was not given the opportunity to undertake this work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Geelong is a city that in proportion to its population, attracts an extremely high percentage of migrants; I think that at one stage of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme Geelong was attracting the highest proportion of migrants in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that I should mention first that the section of the Department of Housing concerned with this matter is associated closely with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Labour and National Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is quite likely that representations were made to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will recall that I asked the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  the following question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> today provided the following answer: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has claimed frequently that  its  <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is not based on racial grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think very properly, pointed out that this is the very basis on which our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)  will recall that I raised 3 different points on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in one evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  has replied to only one of them, and I will quote his reply at the end of the comments I propose to make first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will back up my submission that the Australian policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is still a White Australia policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to get the record straight - and I think this ought to go into Hansard so that a lot of people can see the disgraceful way in which this Government runs its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy - I shall quote from the letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is provision in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for ihe admission of persons not of European descent, who as well as having the capacity to integrate into the Australian community, have qualifications which are in demand and of positive value to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the main, I believe that is the attitude of officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am happy with it but 1 should like to know whether the Department draws a distinction between people who come back to Australia like this and who are debited against the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and those who return and are debited to the Department of External Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not give the name of the man involved because the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is handling the case in another State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was intended to differentiate between returning Australians for whom provision was made under item 08 of subdivision 4 of Division 330 and distressed Australians who are not assisted by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I think it is sufficiently important on these estimates to say something about it, because the question that was answered by the Minister tonight makes quite apparent the reason why we are now becoming once again very misunderstood in other parts of the world with our controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would like to assure the Minister that he need have no worry about support for a common sense policy of controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from either the politicians or the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the purpose of a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well understand the fear of the English Government today about persisting with an assisted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in a community which itself has been permeated by a large number of people who, culturally and economically, are not capable and were not capable of being smoothly inducted into the British community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A most expert examination has to be made on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> before public servants, who have only the general rules to guide them, can advise that such a person should be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is a nation of 12 million people afraid of in regard to cases such as these which confront us in a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 want to emphasise to the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that this is not the policy of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is not to convey this impression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is the cornerstone of the future of this nation, if it is to have a future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must have a positive and everbroadening approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we must never allow our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy to go to the extent that the answer conveyed to us tonight indicates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these people are fairminded enough to accept our policy of controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but not if we allow these individual cases to give a distorted picture which will predominate in the publicity that is given overseas to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I object to the expression which  Senator Poyser  used: ‘I am filled with disgust at our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy as was referred to by  Senator Little. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy it means that you limit the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of people into this country,I do not know of any country which does not have a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of some description. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have before me the official platform of the ALP and I think it is wise thatI should read this becauseI do not think there is any significant difference between the official policy  of  the ALP and the official policy of the Government with regard to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This policy states that the Labor Party believes in an expanding <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which says that no person, whatever his colour or race, or whatever be his creed, is to be denied entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vet because we have a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy there must be some people who would wish to enter but will not be able to enter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that the difficulties he feels are the difficulties which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  has to recognise and to determine in the decisions that he makes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I suggest that the Minister might send the answer that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  supplied this morning to question number 794 asked by  Senator Poyser  back to the Department because it is obviously inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about the Government’s policy and the policy of the Australian Labor Party on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> being the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us clean the position up by the Minister for Housing making sure that the answers given in the debate on this matter are reviewed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 refer to the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and its application to . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Australian Labor Party believes in a controlled <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no condemnation of the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy; my concern is with the administration of the policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy but its application, and I think it is to be deplored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator’s interpretation of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of this country coincides exactly with that already enunciated by the Nazi Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister also failed to reply to my query about Papuans who do not come under any sort of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate on last year’s Estimates I raised with the then Minister the matter of the recruitment of staff for our embassy at Belgrade in Yugoslavia and the planned expansion - although some of it is in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> category - of our activities in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Item 13 - Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - calls for an explanation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If other Ministers are not ready to comment on the Department of Customs and Excise, the Department of the Interior and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, then we can come back to that later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Turning to the question of job opportunities, we have heard the story of the troubles we are experiencing with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By way of preface to my question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I refer to a case last year involving a part Aboriginal boy named McKenzie who disappeared into East Germany and was then returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise tonight to direct some remarks to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  who is represented in this chamber by the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>M.P., Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I state that without endeavouring to be dogmatic or to question the role of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department,  1  do have ample material to raise with your colleague, the Minister for Shipping, certain aspects of foreign ships engaged in the lucrative oil tanker traffic creating situations which encourage desertion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Director of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a copy of this communication so that he will be aware of the current situ  hi  ion as regards the seamen concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I immediately phoned, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and said that I had these 2 boys with me and that the members of the Lebanese community did not want to be breaking the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that these are facts that our Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should have realised, instead of treating this as just a simple desertion case and nothing else.. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make  a  point about the rather rigid attitude of our Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They gave me chapter and verse of cases in which the Home Secretary, who has functions equivalent to our Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, exercises clemency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt  Mr Lynch  has not bothered to look closely at the situation, if he -has not time to look at these matters in- person, he should create an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> appeals tribunal such as I suggest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like it to be conveyed to  Mr Lynch,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, that in my view sitting in Canberra and looking at this thing at long range is not good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend to him the conduct of a former Canadian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Dame  Annabelle Rankin who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> can give me chapter and verse covering seamen and others who have been given sanctuary in Australia,  I  will say that the Minister is adopting a balanced attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gave me a similar answer in a previous case in which he probably was right, but this case is different, ff he would only emulate the practice of the British Minister and set up an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> appeal tribunal there would not be the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  very correctly said in his written reply to  Senator Mulvihill:  - The essential feature in these cases is that illegal entry by deserting seamen is very frequent and must therefore bc discouraged in every way possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mulvihill,  in bringing this matter before the Senate, expressed his concern for people who -desert for a. variety of reasons, and he asked that the Minister consider the establishment of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> appeals tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>expressed his concern for people in special circumstances, before the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710217_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> a question with regard to yesterday’s announcement by the Minister that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake, will be reduced by 10.000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill provides legislative basis for the comprehensive programme of migrant education which was announced in the House of Representatives on 23rd April 1970 by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The short title - <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act 1970  -  indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> provision in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee will include representatives from State Education Departments as well as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Education and Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 8 provides authority for the conduct of such research, which will be undertaken by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Education and Science in conjunction with the research units of the State Education Departments and of appropriate tertiary institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be provided under the annual appropriations for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter which I wish to mention briefly is the pressures placed on the economy by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>( am delighted that the Government is to have a review of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been brought about to a great extent by our very successful <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, in saying this I am not being critical of our past <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What 1 am saying is that I support the idea of a review of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy because 1 believe that the time has come for us to decide whether it is in the interests of the economic welfare of Australia to continue the rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at the same high level as it has been in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minis  ter for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment and Welfare, on behalf of the Maltese Government and by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  on behalf of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister of Labour, Employment and Welfare, on behalf of the Maltese Government and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on behalf of the Australian Government initialled agreed draft texts of the proposed new Migration and Settlement Agreement and related Arrangement dealing with assisted passage provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In formulating these texts, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had the advice of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Treasury, Labour and National Service, Social Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Services and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have already had initial discussions on social services reciprocity with  Dr Tabone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In returning to the attack tonight I again direct my remarks to the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin),  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the last occasion 1 raised the matter the Minister for Housing read a reply from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in which he more or less sheltered behind the policy of adopting a rigid attitude to what he called a high degree of ship desertions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In her reply on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> she said it was correct that as a general rule seamen who deserted overseas ships were deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently this was the basis of the rejection by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of the request by these 2 Lebanese seamen for political asylum in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not criticise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for the decision he has made in these cases, but I think that it is interesting to refer to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have been unable to ascertain from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> any case in which seamen such as the Lebanese seamen have been, as it were, taken into the bosom of this country and given sanctuary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was happy to have them back but it seems to me that we have a rather peculiar attitude if our own Treasury has to pay the fares and then we bring the people back through the other door to meet an outmoded concept of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is unable to give any information about conditions for crew members on Greek ships but I think  Senator Cotton,  who represents the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Nixon)  will have some information for the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> believes that this kind of malpractice clearly has to be discouraged or it will become more prevalent in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as  Senator Mulvihill  has said and as I have said on previous occasions, that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> exercises discretion to allow deserters to remain on humanitarian grounds, but obviously if shipboard conditions are bad the remedy lies elsewhere, not in condoning the practice of desertion by seamen from their ships in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be improper for me, without consulting the Minister to give an answer concerning 2 people because I do not know enough about the case, but the overall picture is that deserting seamen deported from Australia are not prevented from migrating to Australia subsequently if they can meet normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not know whether they could meet normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requirements or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some notes were passed to me late this evening because it was felt that they might aid  Senator Mulvihill  and  Senator Dame  Annabelle Rankin who in this chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it consider launching an immediate inquiry into the huge savings to be made by drastically curtailing the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme which was recently estimated to be costing us about S 1,400m a year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> elaborate on the question I asked some days ago in relation to ethnic percentages? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know full well that overall there, generally has been a bipartisan attitude to the fundamentals of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, but we feel that in this very vital matter of the attainment of a reasonable form of communication between all Australians and a better appreciation of the English language by certain sectors of the migrant community, something further should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I go along I hope to indicate to the Senate that when this legislation was before the other place the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  left a number of things in the air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In winding up the debate in the other place the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, when referring to remarks about encouraging the participation of employers in allowing employees time to attend classes, made one admission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of anything specific when the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin),  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, is replying to the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I am on this subject I wish to pay tribute to the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Sydney and their counterparts in the other States for the manner in which they handle the crash programme of higher grade English classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  know that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is under scrutiny at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this will answer some of the unfounded criticism which has been made of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> where there have been some other problems these committees have been created to advise the Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this Council has its place in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> firmament but I believe that in the main it is preferable to have people under 45 who have made good in open competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Bill which is before the Senate today is a comprehensive one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)  who in this chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  said during the second reading speech that the Bill related to the total area of migrant education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the measure comes from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and was introduced by the Minister in the Senate representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, it is also affiliated with the Department of Education and Science. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council is one of the institutions associated with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whose special task and assignment is the integration of new settlers into the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For these and many other reasons it has been the policy of the Government, ever since the beginning of our large scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, to provide in varying and expanding degrees English language instruction to nonEnglishspeaking migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968, on the initiative of the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Snedden,  arrangements were made with the New South Wales Government for a division of research and planning within the New South Wales Department of Education, lt was arranged that the division should work in cooperation with the Commonwealth Department of Education and Science and with the Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously it was only a pilot survey, but it was complemented by other surveys undertaken by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> into the whole matter of language problems at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking briefly at the adult education field, and referring again to the surveys and to the Government’s programme, the provision of an education service to enable adult migrants to learn the English language goes back as far as the beginning of the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme in 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These were reflected in the speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  in another place on 23rd April 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Turkey, Greece, Italy, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Yugoslavia and elsewhere a variety of classes and courses dealing with the English language are conducted, some by ICEM, some by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and others in association with various agencies and instrumentalities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is an area of national activity which is undergoing a series of changes and studies at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cost benefit analysis could enable the Government to structure an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme in accordance with population considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The many efforts made over the years in our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme are reflected in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we should say that the Bill is concerned not only with either education or <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies as such but also with fundamental social rights These rights have been set out in the United Nations Universal Declarations oi Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reference to the amendment moved by the Opposition, I refer honourable senators to the speech of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when concluding the debate in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred &gt;o the fact that expenditure on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> education has been mounting progressively through the years, and with it the services provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is obvious to mc that Parkinson’s law is being allowed to operate in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could cut by half the staff employed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in London as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another little clause in the Bill provides that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> may arrange for the conduct of research projects designed to improve the content of courses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I have the feeling that there will be a tremendous increase in the sub-section of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> involved wilh education of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing how the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> works, gaining approval to be a migrant to Australia is not a rapid process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we are about to build up another subdepartment, in which case there must certainly be a First Assistant Director-General (Art of Living), Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Athens the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had a very good system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was there I visited the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is such a thing as Australian cooking, it is taught to intending immigrants at the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> centre in Athens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been a dreadful thing for our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme if we had rejected many of the fine families which have come here and which are now successfully integrated because perhaps the mother - in most cases it would be the mother - did not have a knowledge of the English language when she came here and did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the difficulties brought about by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill accepts what should be a Commonwealth responsibility, lt is the Commonwealth that has implemented the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and is responsible for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a representative of the State of Victoria, I suggest that too much of the responsibility for the subsidiary problems that emanate from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been placed upon the States as an added burden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to persist with our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme - there are those of us who feel that Australia has no future without an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme - and if we are spreading our net much wider now, problems will certainly arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points raised by  Senator Little  are of great importance and I will ensure that they are brought to the notice of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has had useful discussions with representatives of employer federations and the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the sitting was suspended I was replying to questions raised earlier by honourable senators relating to the Bill now before the Senate, and I had promised to refer to .the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> those questions which I felt I was not able to answer or which it was not proper for me to answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been stated already in this House and by the Minister in another place, in February 1960 a special committee of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council submitted a report on the progress and assimilation of migrant children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I remind the honourable senator, which took the initiative again in 1962 in conducting a survey of abandonment from migrant education classes in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong to say that nothing has been done because there has been continuing work, a continuing review and continued appreciation of what is required in our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First let me say that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is not totally a Commonwealth responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the States have had the responsibility for bearing the costs of the social infra-structure resulting from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, they have not called for any halt in the programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government spending provide further support for the view that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> funds should not be used to finance capital works in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work that is being done by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, by the people who are teaching migrant children and by the people who are assisting adult migrants in the great difficulties which confront them in a new land is of tremendous importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister also inquire whether it is true that the same journalist’s position had been in jeopardy because of revelations he made in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which had greatly embarassed the Government and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the recent statistics produced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the number of Asians with professional qualifications granted permanent domicile in Australia, how does he account for the rejection of 2 applications mentioned by the Sydney ‘Sun’ and 2GB columnist Anne Deveson concerning, firstly, a Chinese girl born in Malaysia who has qualified as an accountant and, secondly, a Chinese microbiologist who finds that there are no outlets for his professional talents in Hong Kong? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Occasionally inquiries made by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have shown that there has been no demand in Malaysia for particular qualifications which have been obtained by students in Australia, and favourable consideration has then been given to a grant of resident status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise to question the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy being practised by this Government as portrayed in a publication called the ‘Evolution of a Policy’ produced by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Lynch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only criticism I have in that respect is that while the Minister is entitled to take full credit and I pay homage to the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Hubert  Opperman I think the publication might have referred to the statesmanlike attitude of the Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party,  Mr Whitlam,  who stood shoulder to shoulder on the rostrum with the Minister when that policy was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early this year she received a letter from the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Lynch,  in which he used the standard phrases that the overseas student programme under which Miss Lau was admitted to Australia meant that she had acquired a certain professional skill and that she had to go back to the country of her origin so that the skill she had obtained could lift the conditions of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a high regard for the New South Wales <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  and  Mr Forbes,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, are aware that J have already raised the problem of another group of Asian men and women who have qualified in accountancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second point is that  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson was good enough to give me a very lengthy statement on our attitude to the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some years ago the Government announced that there would be a liberalisation of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies in regard to non-Europeans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some years a liberalised policy was operated by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but in the last 2 years or so I have noticed a hardening of the attitude of the Department or of the administration, whichever it may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have spoken to other members of the Parliament belonging to the Liberal Party, Australian Country Party, my own Party and the Australian Labor Party and have found agreement that there has been a hardening of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies against Asians and non-Europeans over the last couple of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I receive, as other members do, long letters from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say once again that we ought to have a good hard look at our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to be friendly with Asia, as we say we want to be, our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws ought to be implemented with humanity and reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the force of their views will be considered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has had many representations made to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on her behalf, and I am assured that the various Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have given all these applications and requests the deepest consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Government has been relaxed to permit the bringing in to this country of people who have particular skills that the community needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy could not be termed a racist policy in this respect; it is a policy of selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in thai only those people who have skills which would enable them to be readily absorbed into our community are permitted into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the information which has been given is correct the deportation of Miss Lau could be’ only on racist grounds because she complies with all the requirements of the relaxed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has relaxed its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy to attract to Australia people who have the same skills as Miss Lau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is from time to time contested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The records held in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of passengers leaving Australia, which date from 1st January 196S do not contain the name of Alan Cameron Charles Stewart up to 31st January 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Expenditure brought to account by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is not dissected to show the administrative cost of bringing each migrant to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, an assessment of $66 per migrant has been made on the basis of estimated expenditure directly associated with overseas recruitment, en route services and reception in Australia in respect of the revised 1970-71 <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme of 170,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it necessary for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to bring migrants to this country by ship at  a  dearer rate than that for which they can be brought here by air - naturally using Qantas Airways Ltd? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will convey the question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and endeavour to get a reply for the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I refer to the need for more effective liaison between him and the Minister in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek an explanation as to why the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> gave an answer to a question identical to one asked by me yesterday to which I could not receive an answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question related to methods to be used in relation to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cutback from various countries and I had alerted the Minister in this place several hours before the Senate convened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question he asked was why I was not able to give him an answer to a question which he asked yesterday when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who, of course, is in another place, was able to give an answer to a similar question when it was asked in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform him, however, that the major part of the reduction in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for 1971-72 will be in the field of assisted migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Summarised, the information which has been supplied to me indicates that, where the bookings have been made by the Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, roughly 56,500 in 1970-71 were booked through Qantas Airways Ltd and approximately 1,000 were booked through other airlines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering the position in which Qantas finds itself and the fact that it is to carry 30,000 fewer passengers to this country because of reduced <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, one would have thought that the Government would have ensured that newcomers to Australia would have travelled by air because, firstly, as I said I am informed, it is cheaper and, secondly, Qantas would not have been placed in a position in which it was not operating the number of flights which it could operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One aspect which was raised by honourable senators opposite is <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said - honourable senators opposite have raised this matter on a number of occasions - that there have been changes in our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and that further changes will occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment Australia probably is tapering off its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I pay tribute to the very effective field staff we have handling <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Ministry is the logica] one to take over matters relating to Australians who will go to England now that the United Kingdom has introduced new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to do something about reconstruction, all it would have to do would be to hand this ministerial chore to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to an earlier answer I received from the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in relation to the ratification of the Refugee Seamen’s Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> seen an article in last Sunday’s Brisbane Truth’ in which it was stated that a senior <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer in Sydney had revealed that if a person comes to this country for $10 under the assisted passage scheme and then decides to return to his motherland before the contracted 2-year period has expired, there is nothing the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials at airports can do about it except to take the person’s name, address and passport number and then allow him to proceed on his way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the policy of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is to ensure that migrants who come to Australia are prepared to settle permanently in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I will take steps to ensure that his question and the concern that he has expressed are brought to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> seen a Press report that a black American citizen has been refused permission to remain in Australia for another year despite the fact that he is reported to have special skills and guarantees of employment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask the Minister whether he has seen the following statement purported to have been made by his colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the Senate of the precise nature of the rules to which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> referred in that statement or, failing that, will the Minister table a complete set of these rules, for the information of all honourable senators, before the Senate rises for the winter recess? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can do is refer the text of his question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to obtain a reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister representing the Prime Minister allay any existing fears that, as a consequence of the new United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Bill and that country’s probable Common Market membership, Australians entering that country in the near future could have less freedom of movement as regards employment in the United Kingdom than citizens of Common Market nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, be that as it may, I indicated in answer to the honourable senator on 30th March this year that Australia’s High Commissioner in London has been in touch with the British Home Secretary on the British <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apart from the odium of the Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of the day in some instances having to order deportation consideration must be given to another product of these systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, in one or two of the subsequent rejections I received from the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and subsequent Ministers in that portfolio the point seems to be that if the people tried hard enough when they returned to their own countries they would be able to find employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sum up my submissions tonight by saying that the time is opportune for the Minister to do more than pay lip service to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in his news releases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I have deliberately quoted only 1 case tonight - I know that  Senator Greenwood  will convey it to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - I have 4 other cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be wrong for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  to act in any way other than one which is consonant with the overall objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We find that not only in relation to health but also in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and social services there is frequent repetition of the same type of problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am fully aware that there are many other important subjects warranting the attention of this Parliament, such as <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, foreign affairs, health and education and I hope that at a later stage I will be given an opportunity to canvass them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer tothe honourable

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I
            think it is significant that in addition to being the Commonwealth Attorney-General,
               Senator Greenwood  happens to represent in this
            chamber the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr
            Forbes).</inline> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In
          speaking for the Opposition I said that by and large it was a step forward, but in doing
          so I quoted the criteria that was applied by the late President Kennedy when, as a
          senator who specialised in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters in the United States Senate, he pointed
          out that any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should be one that is generous, fair and flexible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
            Dame</inline>
    <p>Annabelle Rankin, who represented the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, said
          that of course citizenship is a matter of privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if he is looking at this matter from
          the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> attitude as distinct from that of Attorney-General, he will agree that
          on numerous occasions we go to various functions and talk about Australia’s virtues
          and vices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 repeat that I have no doubt that when the Attorney-General
          confers, as he no doubt will, with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Minister for
          <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will tell him that this is something which has been raised persistently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710908_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware that the practice of using Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme as a means of obtaining a holiday is widespread, though from time to time experience has indicated that persons have sought in a variety of ways to use the migration provisions in order to obtain benefits other than those which Australia hopes to receive from that programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>This projection was based on assumptions that the basic figure of 18 million would rise to almost 23 million if <span class="highlight">immigration</span> were assumed to bring in 100,000 persons per annum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be undesirable for us to place ourselves in a position of underpopulation unless we are prepared to change our attitude to race and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and are prepared to accept in far greater numbers people from the over-populated and under-privileged nations of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710929_senate_27_s49/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I address my question to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Committee surveys that arc now under way on certain aspects of migrant community integration, does the Minister contemplate a crash programme involving a corps of social workers to enter the area pinpointed by the Melbourne Children’s Hospital’s recent report and apparently defined as a domestic disaster area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter that I raise, again on this theme of British-Australian relations, is the rather undue silence being maintained by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  as to our attitude to the future impact of the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I desire to direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, is it true that the present Government parties, when in opposition, adopted a bipartisan approach to Australia’s post war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme, whose architect was  Mr A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, do recent tumultuous events in the Australian Labor Party, leading to the disappearance of the Opposition’s spokesman for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, mean, the end of an agreed and intelligible policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will the Minister inform the House whether he will approach the Opposition and suggest that it appoint several spokesmen who will bc prepared to explain the varied and differing views on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which the ALP is publicly proclaiming? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One such policy through the years has been the concerted view of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as it has been presented to the outside world by the Australian attitude practically across the board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one also ought to pay respect to the work that was carried out 21 or 22 years ago by the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, who will retire fairly soon and whose work in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in this country, I think, was quite notable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> outline the extent of liaison which exists between his Department and the New South Wales Department of Education as regards the acceptance of United States and West German migrant teachers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> knows, West Germany has not been a source of teachers for New South Wales but the United Kingdom and North America have been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Department of Education and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have worked very closely together on the matter of recruitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the last part of the honourable senator’s question I do not agree with his general observation made to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Dr Forbes,  that Asian teachers should be given permanent domicile here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures that I have in relation to the extensiveness of medical health coverage more than prove what was set out in the 1971 <span class="highlight">immigration</span> planning report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In what way can immigrant ethnic groups make submission to Committees to be set up by the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council to study aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> integration, as announced in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> News Release’ No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the expressed wish of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, it is the intention of Committees of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council to consult ethnic groups on aspects of migrant integration which they, are to study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any written submissions which immigrant ethnic groups may wish to make to the Committees should be addressed to the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council,  Senator G.  S.

    <p>1 direct to the Leader of the Government in the Senate a supplementary question in regard to the effects of the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Bill on Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does he justify his earlier answer that the matter should be referred to the Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when the Australian High Commissioner in London is responsible to the Prime Minister’s Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, does he mean that when asking questions on the Estimates I should direct such questions to the representatives of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> rather than to the representatives of the Prime Minister’s Department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that any matter coming within the portfolio of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Australia must essentially be one in which he will be involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is some matter on which the Prime Minister’s intervention is sought, the first thing he does is to call upon the advice available to him, whether it be from the Department of Health, which is my own Department, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or any other department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question will be referred, very properly, first of all to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who will have to react to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711028_senate_27_s50/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Briefly, they may be granted migrant visas if they are the spouses, dependent children, fiancees, fiances or aged parents of residents of Australia; or if they have qualifications at the level required by the Government’s policy decision of March 1966 concerning non European <span class="highlight">immigration</span> (usually professional qualifications); they may readily obtain visitor visas (tourists, businessmen, etc. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the AttorneyGeneral, in conjunction with his colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, initiate discussions with the Law Institute in New South Wales for the purpose of inculcating into a minority - fortunately - of Sydney law firms an attitude of being more accessible to migrant clients? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult for me to give any indication of what my attitude might be either in discussions with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or in discussions with the law firms to whom the honourable senator has referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information available  to  officers  of the  Department  of  <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> indicates  that the  three  people  mentioned in  the  newspaper reports  were not offered  teaching appointments in  New  South  Wales before their  departure  from the  United  States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one case, enquiries had been instituted in Australia by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to assess the teacher employment prospects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> co-operates closely with the State Education Departments in the recruitment of school-teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are not required to counsel applicants in relation to employment opportunities in State Education Departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, addressed to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, arises from the question asked by  Senator Mulvihill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 direct a further question to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: As he has informed the Senate of the reason for the refusal of an assisted passage to  Mr Nigel  Joseph, why could not the reason have been given to  Mr Joseph  when he requested it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator raises matters of policy that have a marked effect on the administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although 1 would like to help  Senator Cavanagh,  I do not feel I should take it upon myself to make policy judgments on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who is absent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether it is a fact that twice in the past 18 months the Minister has rejected an application for Australian citizenship from  Mr Felipe  Ysmael. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What control does the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> exercise in ensuring that private employers such as the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd do not distort migrant intake targets determined by the Commonwealth Government by virtue of their own overseas migrant recruiting compaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that there is no prospect of private employers distorting the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme by overseas migrant recruitment campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The campaigns themselves take place within the framework of the assisted passage programme, and this is carefully controlled in size and structure by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could observe equally that there is an <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council which is most notably chaired by a member of the Senate, lt does remarkably good work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Represented on the Council are the employers and the unions, and from time to time it examines the overall <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  predecessors have expressed the view that they do not favour anysuchscheme and I am assured that the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> adheres to the views of his predecessors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To that extent they are exceptions to the general rule.I am assured by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that he has no knowledge of the scheme referred to and that it would he contrary to the policy which his Department has followed over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representng the Treasurer aware of the great concern being felt by representatives of local government at the increasing cost burden which is being placed on the local councils in providing recognised municipal facilities due in some instances to the Commonwealth Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the  Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  upon  notice:  (1)How many social workers are employed by the Departmentof <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and where are they located? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>(3)Which non-government social work agencies receive assistance from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and what is the level of assistance in each case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 3lst October 1971 the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was employing 16 social workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the current establishment of the section of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which deals with public relations and publicity in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We encourage their <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in its policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, must add greatly to the problems of the States in their attempts to find housing money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Is the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware that during the recent building boom in Australia hundreds pf migrant tradesmen were brought into Australia, particularly Western Australia, to relieve the shortage prevalent at that time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister consider that the increasing numbers of unemployed in Australia warrant a very close look at our immigation policy, perhaps with the object of suspending all <span class="highlight">immigration</span> until such time as the numbers of unemployed are considerably reduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me that the general tenor of the honourable senator’s question is that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is too large and ought to be reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter to which the Government has given close attention over the years and recent announcements indicate that the projected <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake for this year is approximately 30,000 fewer than the intake of other years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it should never be forgotten that the development and growth of Australia and the material standards in which all Australians have shared have been made possible over the last two or three decades by an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme in which all parties have participated and shared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the honourable senator can be assured that the Government does pay attention to the needs of particular areas in the administration of its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and is conscious of the need to be able to maintain a proper <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for what appears to be Australia’s likely growth in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711201_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1592 that I have placed on the notice paper which seeks clarification of the statues of Australian citizens in the United Kingdom following the enactment of new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask him as an interim measure: In the event of wishing to intervene in a complaint received from an Australian involved in a dispute with the British Home Office in this regard should 1 use the avenue of the Prime Minister’s Department or the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator wishes to intervene in a case of this nature, my advice to him would be to approach the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because the Prime Minister’s Department would have to get the relevant facts from the Department of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asked this question because  Sir Alec  Downer is the representative in London and he is not directly responsible to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, I think it would be much better if the honourable senator were to approach the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the Prime Minister’s Department would have to get from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the background to the case and the relevant facts about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about the possibility of stopping migration until the unemployment situation in Australia eased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I can add anything to what I said yesterday except to re-assure the honourable senator that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is necessary because of the type of development which has been occurring in Australia and which the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In submitting this motion to the Senate, I look back over 22 years of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering what has happened in the era from Arthur Calwell to  Dr Forbes,  honourable senators will concede the dedication of the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding past debates on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters, even with my most inquisitive mind I could not cavil at the detailed answers That T have received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has existed for a long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer first to the 1969 edition of the ‘Senate Manual’ of the United States, which states that a Joint Congressional Committee on <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Nationality Policy has been established to investigate the problems of aliens and nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made that point, I turn to another document which is produced by the Office of the Minister of Manpower and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is dated 1 2th September 1967 and is a complete review of Canadian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 know that the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> maintain a close liaison with this office in Canada with regard to policy matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance is that on page 2 of what is a lengthy statement the Minister,  Mr Marchand,  refers to the ‘Parliamentary Committee studying the White Paper on <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say in passing that I know that the United States had some inbuilt <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problems between 1924 and the Second World War that Australia did not exactly experience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that spokesmen for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will talk about the series of advisory committees that filter various ideas, and also about the Australian Citizenship Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say clearly, speaking for  Senator Murphy  in this Committee and  Mr Whitlam  in another place, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a matter of people and not statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To substantiate that comment, I refer to a lengthy statement, dated 20th September 1971, by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that even when that evaluation has been carried out by officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, sufficient scrutiny will not have been given to the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been geared to anticipate problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not big problems but they are indicative of the weaknesses of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> filtering system and of the advisory committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am getting at is that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and its Ministers have always had the problem of balancing relations between trade unions and employer groups and the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At those meetings the State Ministers who have <span class="highlight">immigration</span> within their responsibility parade in a sort of semi-camera attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking for myself, it is not a question of stopping the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 say respectfully lo  Senator Greenwood,  who is representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, that there is nothing to be lost in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for bringing to my attention a lengthy analysis or rebuttal of the report on education by the Brotherhood of St Lawrence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is an important subject on which today there are wide differences of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate  Senator Mulvihill  not only on his great interest in and knowledge of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but also on the way in which he presented his case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that much research is being done now through the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Government sponsoring research in:o <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, which is a matter into which, of necessity, much research has to be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think really that we should consider the importance of the investigation since we are now facing the necessity to alter our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In altering our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme we should be careful that we do not bring into operation any decision which has not been properly researched or thought through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since Opposition senators from time to time have questioned the exercise of discretion by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the operation of its policy, and especially in relation to decisions which affect people who are prohibited immigrants, I should like to take this opportunity to allow the Senate, as a welcome change, to hear me congratulating the Department instead of snipping at it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my representation the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  and his officers exercised their discretion to allow  Mr Anthony  to leave the country for 5 days and lo return and rejoin his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we conduct this discussion on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as Australians talking about the things that are of interest to Australia, not as members of a particular political party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am getting away altogether from the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that such an inquiry would contribute as much to a solution of its problem as research by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a matter which must be inevitably reflected in Government policy, irrespective of what we as Australians and members of the Parliament think and what advice we give to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that without <span class="highlight">immigration</span> there would be no growth at all in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The birth rate is not high enough for this nation to grow at all without <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  think it is a mistake to think that any of the economic pressure* of all problems which exist today can be solved completely by restricting <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who think that the unemployment problem in this country today can be solved by stopping <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should turn back the clock to what happened in the 1930s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any businessman or trade union official who is worth his salt knows what would happen if the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme were stopped entirely overnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have a lot of respect for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I have a lot to do with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Lots of people come to me with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the tremendous difficulty there would be in trying to run an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme if too much looseness were permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I agree in the main with its philosophical approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cases of this nature did not seem to occur before the decision to cut back the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme was taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 think that the grounds of rejection are patently not what, in my experience, has been the normal approach of our Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wonder when the Government proposed the expenditure for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether it really looked into the matter seriously or whether it looked at last year’s figures, increased them a little, and put them down for this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood)  who in this chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  said that the Government is cutting down the migration programme by 30 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and its Ministers should be quite capable of looking at <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the correct light and of producing the right result for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am an ordinary Australian and I do not profess to be an expert on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but I feel this is like buying tyres for a motor car before you have a car. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we should adopt an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy somewhat similar to that which the United States has had for some years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am trying to impact is that the Government should look very carefully at its migration policy and decide whether Australia should spend this much money on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words he did not reject the concept, as T understood him, of at least having an all Party committee to look at the problems that have arisen in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> field and to try to map out something for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, is different from what we have put forward regarding a joint committee to deal with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously in any consideration of the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> we want the widest experience we can get. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite stupid, I suggest, to say that the only people who have knowledge of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problems are members of the Senate, not members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think members of the House of Representatives would get much more <span class="highlight">immigration</span> work in their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that on this occasion the Aus-, tralian Labor Party has suggested setting up a joint committee to look at the whole question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we read the entire history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> we will get involved in all sorts of phrases over the last 100 years, but if we look at its recent history - I do not want to belabour this point because it is self-evident - the situation which attracts migrants to Australia today is vastly different from .the days immediately after World War 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite a few contributions on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have been given to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government itself has reduced the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In July the Government set up 3 committees to examine the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> set-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister  for  <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  of  the day,  Mr- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phillip Lynch, said that it would examine the important population and demographic studies financed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A completely separate committee was set up: Associate Professor J. Wilson of the University of Sydney had begun work on cost benefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under current Australian conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 asked yesterday a question on (his matter of the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood)  who represents in this chamber the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  but he did not know the answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These reports should be made public because they would be fascinating studies and because of the tremendous interest in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> not only in this chamber but by just about everybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suggest to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that he should bend over backwards to do this because the contribution of such studies to learning about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would be absolutely immense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the fast moving pres sures on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> we suggest today that all of these matters could be examined by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people say thar the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be doubled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people say that we should not have any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at all, while other people  say that the number should be cut down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we are asking is that we add to the committees that the Government has set up under its own initiative, and that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> be brought into the” public gaze and the preview of a committee of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am heartened by the fact that in the debate today nobody has argued that studies on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ought not to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Willesee  provides an instance where the Leader of his Party felt there was merit in having a senator speak on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters rather than a member of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Willesee  suggested that there was merit in spreading the area of inquiry into these <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters by having a joint select committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only regret that the traditional bipartisanship which has characterised the approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of this country is not surviving as well as it did in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope, as far as the Government is concerned, that it will always accept the responsibility for determining what <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake Australia .can afford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe I say that because I am aware of the far ranging inquiries which are already taking place under the auspices of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government in the national interests has adopted over a period of years the broadest possible approach in formulating <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and giving effect to those policies through annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ‘ cannot emphasise sufficiently that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has been, as an honourable senator said earlier, a bipartisan approach in previous years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times the Government has developed extremely comprehensive consultative’ machinery on all aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has established the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning’ Council which deals primarily with economic matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council which deals with administrative and social matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention also the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Publicity Council which is concerned with publicity and information activities in Australia and overseas.Recently, there was a widening of the’ functions of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comprehensive reports are supplied periodically to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, lt is a programme which has been successful and it is continuing because there is recognised to be merit in what is being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Government has sponsored research into aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which dates back more than a decade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attention has been given to a tremendous number of facets of the whole <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This work is being carried out by the Australian National University and is financed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second area of inquiry which is under way is the costbenefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under current Australian conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This work is being carried out by the University of Sydney and is also financed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, late in 1971, the Australian Labor Party seeks to have a joint committee of the Parliament established to inquire into the financing and all other aspects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have outlined, of course, is only a small part of a body of research which has been completed into various aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> over the years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To mention another study, only recently the Austraiian National University published a bibliography and digest on Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is substantial and impressive evidence of the scope and depth of the research into <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>f say that at present there is nothing to be gained from establishing a joint committee of the Parliament to inquire into and report upon the financing and all other aspects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason why our annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme should not continue to be shaped directly and controlled by the Government in the light of our current national needs, the availability of suitable settlers and own capacity to integrate them, against the background of containuing inquiry and research of the character 1 have outlined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the time has arrived for a joint select committee of the Parliament to examine all aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I hat one matter which should be examined is the fact that 200,000 people, according to the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  last week, who are eligible to become Australian citizens have not applied to accept that responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greenwood),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to bring before the Minister the inhumane manner in which he and the Department are handling some of the applications for assisted pas sage’s and also the inconsistency that the Department is showing in some cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a joint select committee should be appointed to inquire into and report upon the financing and all other aspects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The senator passes each case on to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a continuing, deep and abiding interest not only in the programme of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but also in the people who make up the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is fairly natural that he should call for a study in depth of the financing and other aspects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely wish to say, in support of what the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  said a little earlier this afternoon, that there is a continuing study not merely on the financing but on all other aspects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer in the first instance to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council which has been established for a considerable number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, over which it is my privilege to preside, was set up by the first Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the post-war period,  Mr Arthur  Calwell, and its work has continued ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So all backgrounds of political thinking and political philosophy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> are brought to bear upon the deliberations of these 2 councils which, as the Minister has said, are meeting constantly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So month by month, through each year, continuing inquiry into the financing and all other aspects of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the fact that the whole programme of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> not only is constantly under review but also is related to the additional studies to which the Minister has referred and which are in effect outside the councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that I am very disappointed at the reference that was made by the last  speaker  to inhumanity within the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with other honourable senators, and more especially because I am so closely involved with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, I have had the opportunity to study the work of officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, lo study closely the work of the Minister, to study closely the work of the selection officers abroad and of those who are here in Canberra and who make decisions in relation to various migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of this work, a programme that, is so diverse and so large as the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme of Australia has been able to proceed with success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>John Boyle O’Reilly, referring to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and objecting to patronage, used these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that  Senator Little  was not simply saying that the country has to develop - it is for a good cause.I referred to difficulties in rural areas and  Senator Little  said that anyone knows that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has no relevance to the rural position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has agencies to meet all sorts of contingencies, but they do not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 12 months ago, before the scandal broke of car insurance in New South Wales, I referred problems of Lebanese people in that field to  Mr Lynch,  the Minister for Labour and National Service, who was then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always been a supporter of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ohe of the post-war successes of Australia has been the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have always been people in this country who have been opposed to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When he was leaving to go back to England <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was a hot issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember Albert Monk, who was probably the most respected figure in trade unionism over the last 20 years, about 10 years ago at a conference on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, when the move to reduce the number of migrants was just as powerful as it has been in recent months, saying straight out: You cannot turn off and turn on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> like a tap’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme has given to people who came from countries where they did not have a place in the sun an opportunity to have a place in the sun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appeared to me that the object was to centralise in Canberra the administration of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures in regard to these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remarks of the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  have prompted me to raise a couple of matters which I did not have the opportunity to raise during the sittings of Estimates Committee B. I say that with due deference to  Senator Rae,  the  Chairman  of the Committee, who gave the members of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that there could bc occasions when the Minister for Foreign Affairs would influence the decisions of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but I am still not satisfied that some of these graduates from Australian universities have been able to go back to Malaysia and do full justice to their professional qualifications because Malaysia has to try to rationalise its people of Chinese stock and those of Malay origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I would like the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to consult with the State Ministers for education as to ways of overcoming the teacher shortage which exists in Australia by bringing in Asian teachers with the necessary qualifications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I query whether a stab is made at the requirements of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and whether this sometimes results in an appropriation of far in excess of the amount it is within the capability of the Department to spend in the ensuing 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been reading through the reports of the Public Accounts Committee I noted in the 1 13th report of the Committee severe criticism of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> over an appropriation for the building of a migrant office in the Kingdom of Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 13th October the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Colton)  when acting as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> issued a statement denying the criticism that there was a curtailment of or lack of appreciation of the necessity for such classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  who in this Chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  whether the position in South Australia can be examined to see whether the attendance at evening classes in that State justifies the abandonment of the classes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer briefly to the reply which the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  who in this chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  gave in relation to the case I brought before him of a mixed marriage family seeking to obtain an assisted passage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this fact is clearly established by a reply which I received from the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch),  on 2nd November last year when I asked the following question:  ls it a fact that Government policy prevents assisted passages being granted to coloured persons: if so, does this same policy apply to a person of European blood and colour, who is a British subject and has an Indian wife and 3 children who are all British subjects? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he should refer it to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  for examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question  -  f did not seek to put it in any other way and the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did not put it in any other way - thai assisted passages are confined as a matte of policy to persons of European descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that  Senator Poyser  chose to introduce this element into a debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there is one political group in this country which makes quite clear where it stands on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> issue, it is the Government parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so far as Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is concerned, the conference raised a great question mark over where the Party stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this year the Labor Party made a simple addition to its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> platform by adding the words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we now have the Labor Party spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in this chamber, let him indicate whether  Senator Poyser  speaks on behalf of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That particular head of policy coincides with the general approach always followed by the Government, lt was the approach which so often enabled the former Labor Party spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>,  Mr Daly,  to indicate that there was a coincidence of the views on these troublesome matters of the Government and the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy which the new Labor spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>,  Senator Willesee,  espouses has not been staled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as  Senator Poyser  has said, that this Government through its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies has consistently exercised a racial bias over a long period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not even have to look at its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy  to  see this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It  calls this  a  tolerant <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  believe to  be  the unfair criticisms made by the AttorneyGeneral who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and who is handling this debate on behalf  of  the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will recall,  Mr Chairman,  that the Minister, in his criticisms of  Senator Poyser,  quoted out of context one aspect of the Australian Labor Parly’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party supports an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We claim that the Government is not doing at the present time what constitutes the very basis of our policy.It is contained in the preliminary section of the statement of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy: that is, an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance.I think this was very forcefully pointed out by the Minister when he tried to turn the vehicle of propaganda against the members of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Utterances like that from the Country Parly make me feel rather ill. Its members’ main interest in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in this country is to obtain slave labour for some of their run-clown sheep and wheat farms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not blaming the officers in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has tried to turn it around in the other direction and say that under a Labor government there will be no <span class="highlight">immigration</span> restrictions at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, a real argument exists today for a restriction to be placed on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one can understand why suddenly he finds himself with a very conservative and restricted attitude in regard to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That  Senator Keeffe  rose to speak in this debate on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and said that Queensland is a hillbilly State should be known throughout Queensland so that the people know that when he comes here he is not prepared to fight for his own State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very interested in the statements made about the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one who believes that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should be kept at a peak and that we should take anybody who offers himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that we should have an intensely selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy so that wc get the best migrants for the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the general selective policy of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is something of which the average Australian would approve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right being idealistic about this subject, but I am quite positive that the great majority of Austraiian people do not want an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that opens the doors of this country to anybody who wants to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 make no apology for standing here and saying that I approve of the selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy at present adopted by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we have the right to have a selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can -recall that on that, occasion the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and  Mr Whitlam  were more or less on the same wave length on the need for an adjustment of our thinking on Asian migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter whether the topic is  education or <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of both Parties are examined, we see that the position of the Minister is a dangerous one because the policy of the Labor Party is preferred by the average elector when it is explained other than in the way in which  Senator Wood  explained it tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General read portion of Labors <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said, what was read represents the guidelines of Labor’s policy on the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so that there would be no misinterpretation of this policy, the Leader of the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Whitlam,  in a Press conference before television cameras, together with the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, explained in the shadow Minister’s home State Labor’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, lt was stated definitely that there would be no discrimination on the ground of race or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor makes no apology for its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wc believe in a selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy in that we want those people who would best be assimilated here, who would no’ be a threat to our cultures and our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will go to the hustings on our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister by his diversion has prolonged the debate on the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> possibly by 2 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister was too eager to criticise Labor’s policy even to justify the activities of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, like war and peace and a few other matters, is an emotional subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously people have a tendency to be a little carried away when discussing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters, but I do not think anybody should be carried away to the regrettable extent that  Senator Wood  was carried away in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood  challenged the ALP to go to the people on its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it becomes a case of balancing our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy against the racially oriented policy of the Government, the Labor Party will not be routed but Government supporters will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to emphasise that we have preached incessantly that there ought to be tolerance in the administration of the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to emphasise that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should not be based solely on colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are advocating  a  pure white <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some strange reason the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  refuses to grant an assisted passage in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have allowed several speakers to stray beyond the strict limits of a discussion on the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rule that the Attorney-General is in order if he confines his remarks to the context of defending his criticism of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Australian Labor Party, but it is not in order for him to go beyond the matter of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It arose because  Senator Poyser,  a member of the Austraiian Labor Party, accused the Government of having an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which was based on racial discrimination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1, as the person representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  denied that we had a racial policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the policy enunciated by  Mr Daly,  the Labor Party’s spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for man) years, ft is the policy on which the Labor Parly went to countless elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that way we arc no different from Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia - all the other countries which have a similar <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we have people like  Senator Poyser  and  Senator Keeffe  aided of course by the silence of  Senator Willesee,  who is the Labor Party’s spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and people like  Senator Cavanagh  and others, getting up and taking the view that the Government’s policy is wrong because it is racialist, when all we are saying is that we will not give assisted passages to people wanting to come here if they are not of European descent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not heard that from  Mr Daly,  albeit he has been dismissed from his position as shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon,  Senator Mulvihill,  on behalf of the Australian Labor Party moved, without heat or recrimination, for an all-part)’ committee to have a look at the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister - he is not the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but merely the Minister representing the Minister - chose to revert to type in this debate instead of dealing with the estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You would have been the first to say that this had nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s platform on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and on every other issue, both at the Launceston conference and every other conference, is discussed in open session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about the question of coloured <span class="highlight">immigration</span> - you talked about homogeneity in Australia - would you explain to me why the former Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  when he was in Singapore, which is a very receptive place to make this sort of statement, said that we were moving towards a multiracial nation in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was merely an announcement made in 1966 by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that there would be some changes that we would not be so racial in the future, and everybody applauded that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we wrote into our policy as an instruction, as a guideline to a Labor Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, whoever he might be and whether he is a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives, the following: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I say, one can almost bet that, if a quarter passes, when the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is not under pressure in regard to these matters, without our being written up in the South East Asian Press, something has gone wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the moment we try to amend something, to take the racism out of our policy or to make any suggestion that this great white god of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can be touched, it is claimed that we will let down the floodgates, or that we will let all sorts of people enter Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not want anybody to come to this country and not be happy here, lt does not want a system of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under which one in every 4 people are returning to their homeland because they become disgusted and disgruntled with this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are some of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party wants to do something to examine the whole of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> tried to pounce on him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish the Minister would look at the Canadian situation where virtually a rule of law is laid down, lt is not a rule of some <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer looking at a case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Senator Greenwood  is only the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I regret the way in which he handles this sensitive portfolio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will always have difficulties in administering the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because the Department is not handling lumps of wood, it is not in the post office parcelling items and saying: ‘Put them in a bag and send them here or there”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I have such a tremendous admiration for the employees of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, lt is not an easy Commonwealth department to run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very few countries which have no limitations whatever on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was that common cause which made our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy so acceptable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are considering the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just heard one of the best explanations of Labor’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in a selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy by which Australia has the right to select its migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a distinction is drawn as to benefits received from our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy on the basis of colour of skins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the figures given during the Press conference held by our Leader and our shadow minister for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> we find - and this is by coincidence only, I think - thai this policy will bring fewer Asian migrants in I he immediate future than have entered under the policy of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Minister commenced his tirade of abuse this evening, the general idea was: The Labor Party has virtually had an alliance with the Government on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters for 22 years; suddenly the new leaders of the Party are virtually on a path to treason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the remarkable thing is that the whole of the argument that the Minister has advanced tonight is that the Labor Party has some weird approach to the matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister is prostituting this <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cause for blatant electioneering purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Next weekend the New South Wales Council will be issuing releases about interim matters concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, current campaigns, and trade union attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite will remember when  Mr Opperman,  a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, made his historical utterance in Canberra about 3 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me <span class="highlight">immigration</span> means people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At an earlier stage  Senator Cavanagh  asked the reason why the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> underspent approximately $4m in 1970-71. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to know to which line of the estimates the Minister relates a query that he makes of the Australian Labor Party so far as its policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was under the impression that the Committee of the Whole was here to investigate the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  as I do not know how closely you have followed the debate this afternoon and evening on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I think I should indicate that everything seemed to go along smoothly until just prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, which is when SenatorPoyser brought up the question of whether there was racial discrimination against a particular type of migrant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reply of the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood),  who in this chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  to the comments of  Senator Poyser  was not in any way in explanation of the Government’s policy but in criticism of the Australian Labor Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since that time we have had nothing else but talk about the policy of the Australian Labor Party on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point of order was raised as to whether reference to Don Dunstan had any relationship to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to a point of order, the  Chairman  of Committees ruled that this matter was relevant to the debate on the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point of order was raised as to whether the Attorney-General’s speech was relevant to the matter which was before the Chair, namely, the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a rather wide-ranging debate tonight the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It related to a particular line in the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>night, to question the Opposition - without any reference being made to any line of the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - in connection with paragraphs (c) and (f) of the Australian Labor Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, my tolerance was stretched to the limit this evening by the actions of the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood),  who represents in this chamber the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  and who, in trying to get through this chamber the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, had been ranting and raving for the hour before the suspension of the sitting for dinner and for the  21  hours after dinner about the Australian Labor Parly’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included in those Estimates are the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - not the estimates of Labor Party policy, not whether one paragraph is in conflict with another paragraph of Labor Party policy, not whether  Mr Dunstan  agrees with  Mr Daly,  whether  Mr Daly  agrees with  Mr Whitlam  or whether  Mr Whitlam  agrees with  Senator Willesee  as we have been hearing from the Minister for the last 2 hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter under consideration is the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to bring a motion to discuss <span class="highlight">immigration</span> it is open to it to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have raised points of order against the Minister on the basis that on each occasion when the Minister rose to speak he talked about matters concerning the Australian Labor Party machine and not about matters of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or matters relating to the estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that what happened this afternoon and this evening has been, from the point of view of the Labor Party, an entirely slanted approach to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and to the approach of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have asserted time and time again throughout the course of this debate this evening that the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is one which not only is acceptable to the people of this country but also is a policy which this Government will not disavow and which it will be proud to assert, given the opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position is that experienced officers with suitable industrial backgrounds are employed in Britain by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to assess the trade qualifications of migrant applicants and to provide a counselling service as to the qualifications necessary for recognition in the metal and electrical trades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-117-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Etheridge  was classified by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Technical Advisers in London as a machine setter operator which is not a skilled occupation in terms of the Tradesmen’s Rights Regulation Act 1946-1966. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-117-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition 1 wish to put to the Senate, and I do not wish to speak at great length on it, is that it is time we forgot about the stories of gunboats of foreign powers coming into the Indian Ocean; that it is time we had a look at the peoples of the Indian Ocean themselves; that it is time we had a look at our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy; that it is time we had a look at our aid programme; that it is time we had a look at the policies we adopt on colonialism in South Africa, Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonies; that it is time we ceased to find in reports of the United Nations General Assembly or in conferences which take place elsewhere that there is a hard core of three or four countries such as South Africa, Portugal and Australia supporting the position of the South Africans and the Portuguese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 4th November last year I addressed a question on notice through  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  asking for a clear-cut exposition of the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act with respect to its effects generally on Australians entering Britain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-134">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that on that occasion there was some doubt in the minds of  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson, who represents the Prime Minister in this chamber, and  Senator Cotton,  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes),  as to who would be responsible for securing an answer for me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-134">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want to know why it has taken 9 weeks to get an explanation of this facet of the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-134">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He knows that the Citizenship Act requires that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> must be satisfied as to a number of matters before a person who has applied for citizenship can be granted citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can suggest only that if  Senator Mulvihill  supplies me or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> with the details of the particular cases he has in mind those cases will be given attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister  representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> amplify the details of the reduction in Australia’s 1972 <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake with particular reference to the categories and nationalities of prospective migrants, and the staggering of applications from the various countries where Australia operates <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other major point I should put in outlining the significance of the Slates is that although the Commonwealth - and here I pay tribute to a Labor man - largely due to the initiation of  Mr Arthur  Calwell commenced an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme which 1 hope that this Government will go on to maintain and to expand- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme is designed to the point of the migrants being brought, here by the Commonwealth but the full implementation of integrating them into our society is a State and local government matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said with respect to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> situation that the States have a great job indeed to develop the needs in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 particularly instance my father because 1 shall deal with the matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and make a comparison between the attitude of the Australian Labor Party in 1948-49 and the present position because it relates to job opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish now to refer to the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 can recall my father’s reaction when Arthur Calwell introduced an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme was successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Government senators ask at the last minute what is the Labor Party’s attitude on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at the moment, let us be realistic on 2 points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could not but make comparisons between that hostel and the hostels that I went into in the 1950s as a sub-branch official of the Australian Railways Union and as a member pf the Sydney Labour Council’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 remember that this Government appointed an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> planning committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not so long ago,  Senator Greenwood,  as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, gave me a most detailed answer on the backlog of migrants in Europe and the procedures that are followed, lt was a good answer and I complimented him and the Ministry on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen the statement attributed to the former Leader of the Australian Labor Party Opposition and former Labor Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Calwell,  in which he is alleged to have said that there are some people in the Labor Party today who are quite prepared to allow 27,000 coloured migrants into Australia each year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that there is no person better qualified in the Labor Party to have a real appreciation of what Labor Party people think about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and whether or not there are people in the Labor Party who hold that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That bi-partisan policy in regard to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> had been followed since  Mr Calwell  initiated the programme in 1948 and until there was a change in policy in the last year or two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What liaison exists between the Commonwealth Employment Service in the Northern Territory and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in order to control movement of recently arrived migrants to the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is very frequent liaison between the Commonwealth Employment Service in the Northern Territory and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but not for the purpose of controlling the movement of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to ventilate 2 facets of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in which I feel that either the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  should have taken a more positive role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that at the instigation of the Professional Musicians’ Union of Australia I sounded out the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to see whether there was any truth in the assertion that the relative labour employment codes of the United States and Australia were such that undue preference or privileges accrued to American musicians or non-Australian musicians in Australia when compared with the treatment given to Australian musicians overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr McQuaid  went on in his letter to point out that he had had correspondence with the Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the United States Consulate in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date of a letter from the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Either the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or the Prime Minister should deal with the United States on questions such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#debate-68">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say that there was no discussion between the Prime Ministers of Australia and Fiji on the respective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of their countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  has been drawn to the matter concerning  Mr Maas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly  Mr Maas  himself has not raised the matter with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or with the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, whatever views one might have of the respective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, the case of an individual person will not - I think it is a reasonable attitude to take - be taken up by the Minister unless there is some indication that the gentleman himself is complaining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the records of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> relatively few overseas film technicians have been granted visas for temporary residence in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If film technicians are travelling to Australia from the United States ostensibly as visitors but in reality for employment, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is certainly not aware of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the information available to me the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is not aware that these people have come in under the guise of tourists but in reality for employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure, from the character of the notes I have, that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would welcome any information which would suggest that persons are coming in in a guise different from the purpose for which they sought visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that he made application to work in Australia and that, in accordance with the policy which the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> follows, consultations took place with the Department of Labour and National Service and  with the  particular organisation  - I think it was the  Actors Equity Association of Australia - concerned and that on an  examination of  all  the  facts it appeared that there was no particular reason why this person should be preferred in terms of employment over Australians who were able to take the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> does not have separate offices in India but has officers attached to the Australian High Commission in New Delhi and to the Deputy High Commissions in Bombay and Calcutta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> maintains  a  small section to administer the Grants-in-Aid, to provide guidance for each of the State Good Neighbour Councils and to co-ordinate their activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recognition of overseas qualifications is of particular importance and, indeed, a committee working within the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is looking at that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720412_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to be fair to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  to this degree: When this report was prepared - my reservations on it were drafted, I think, about a fortnight ago - I had been waiting for certain answers from  Dr Forbes  dealing with a number of people, including the major figure in the attempted extortion from Qantas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720413_senate_27_s51/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have ascertained from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the position is as follows: The power to authorise or to prevent entry into Australia is conferred by the Migration Act upon the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or upon officers of his Department who are authorised by him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Successive Commonweath Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have taken the firm view that entry into Australia of Asian children whom Australian residents wish to adopt is not prohibited by an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy but that it is clearly and essentially in the interests of the children that the adoption plans have the approval of the expert child welfare authorities in the States concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720418_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> studied the plea of  Mr Alan  Matherson of the Ecumenical Migration Centre that the supply and availability of competent interpreters for migrant services is not geared to the ethnic groups with the greatest needs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I am informed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that there is an extensive translation and interpreter service provided by 3 official sources: firstly, by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, which provides interpreters at the State branch offices; secondly by the Department of Labour and National Service employment offices in areas of high migrant density; and thirdly, by Commonwealth Hostels which have a number of non-English speaking migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> expanded its translation service to form a nucleus which would be available to meet routine departmental requirements, as well as emergency situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1971 the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> completed an Australia-wide survey of interpreter needs in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Project in which the Council is at present involved began in late 1967 as a 5- year study aimed at assessing the contribution made by immigrants to the Australian community since World War II, and studying the problems associated with this large-scale influx of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that a statement has been made by the former Australian Labor Party shadow minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Daly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Daly,  of course, is a former shadow minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Labor Party and it is commonly believed that if the Labor Party were ever to form a government within the next 10 years he would be a minister in any such government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the significance of what  Mr Daly  said is that after a change in the Australian Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy at its Launceston conference last year,  Mr Daly  was dismissed from his position as shadow minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement which he made was that there was some doubt on the Labor Party’s policy on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said it was time - and he repeated the fact that it was time - that a statement was made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party indicating precisely Labor’s policy on nonEuropean <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think also of the times when, in my association with the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, I have had negotiations with the Good Neighbour Councils and between us we have sought to work out solutions to the problems of certain migrants who are in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: (1), (2), (3) and (4)  Mr Peter  Leopold Clyne was in possession of an Australian passport at the time of his departure from Australia on 18th September 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did a Melbourne businessman,  Mr Strecho  Rover, recently have his passport seized in Canada on instructions from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the seizure was made on the instructions of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who has a discretion under the relevant legislation to cancel the passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, acting under the powers granted by the Australian legislation, cancelled the passport and arranged for  Mr Rover  to have a document of identity which would enable him to return to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the balance of the honourable senator’s question concerning the reasons why this was done, I will ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to give him a considered reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to whether there is any link between the actions taken here and in Canada, I will refer that question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because the decision which was made in this case was the decision of that Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware of a document published in the name of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association and forwarded to many members of the community, including members of Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that that document claims that figures published recently by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> show that the total intake of people of non-European and mixed descent for the year to June 1971 is 9,055? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister comment upon the apparent racialist basis of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association’s publications, the nature and extent of its membership and the circulation of its newsletters? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of the publication to which the honourable senator has referred and of the ready impression which one can draw as to where the interests of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association lie. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that I should draw to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, whom I represent, the other matters to which the honourable senator has referred - the nature of the publication, the people who publish it as well as the particular statistics to which he has referred - and leave it to the Minister to make such statement or to give such advice as he considers appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That passport was cancelled on the authority of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> under the powers vested in him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Attorney-General who also is spokesman in this chamber for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances what was said about  Mr Rover  is a matter essentially within the ambit of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer the honourable senator’s questions in that respect to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is asked of the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is: Where the passport of an Australian citizen travelling abroad has been cancelled, has that Australian citizen the right to see the allegations which have been made about him? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a Sydney newspaper yesterday  Mr Sharp  of Blue Metal and Gravel Pty Ltd was reported as saying that continued <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would add to the inflationary trends in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it says that the trade union movement should keep out of that field, I take the point to the next stage: If the trade union movement is involved exclusively with its own affairs, the Government will come to it and say: ‘We need your assistance in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> field’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Recently  I  received a communication from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  dealing with Greek migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be rather egotistical to quote one’s own speeches, but last Sunday I had the honour of participating in an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> seminar at which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Dr Forbes,  was present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-87-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that some action is being contemplated as to his authority to remain in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Because of the reduced intake of migrants into Australia are there some unoccupied apartments at migrant hostels? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, could those apartments not now required for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> purposes be made available for the housing of some of the pensioners in the capital cities who are at present paying exorbitant rents for slum hovels? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are working visas issued from time to time by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to overseas artists to come to Australia for the purpose of performing in social and/or sporting clubs which are specified in their contracts? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seem to recall that I was able to supply to the honourable senator on behalf of the Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> an answer to a question in this general area not so long ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the manner in which the honourable senator has asked his question I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will be interested to provide a reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Vietnamese orphans adoption issue with the earlier statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that in all such cases the initiative had to come from the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the current case relating to the young Vietnamese children the position is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had taken the view that they ought not to be admitted or could not be admitted into Australia until he was satisfied that proper steps were being taken to maintain their welfare in Australia, and that required the consent or some indication of likely consent from the State authorities that an adoption would be recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: In view of the lack of jobs available for Australian graduates, as revealed by the number of applications for graduate employment recently refused by the Public Service, which is typical of the rest of the community, will the Minister say whether the Government intends to continue to allow overseas graduates access to Australia or can some more sensible restriction be applied to graduate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> until the present Australian graduate surplus is employed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say at the outset that I will refer this question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to enable him to give a considered reply to the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I should also amplify what I have just said by indicating that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has made it clear in times past that the reduction of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake for this year is effected by taking account, among other things, of whether there will be employment opportunities for persons seeking to come into Australia having regard to the local demandsupply situation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek information from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 2 counts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In it I sought statistics on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic for the first quarter of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the link between the Bureau of Census and Statistics and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had plenty of fireworks in the Senate in the last few days so I will be content to get an assurance from the Attorney-General who as he said the other days wears several hats, being the Attorney-General and the spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning now to the other matter he raised, I trust that he appreciates that the question of whether or not a person is allowed entry into Australia is one which has to be resolved by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like him to believe that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> does not neek advice on issues about which he has some doubts or upon which he feels advice is prudent from other departments, including the AttorneyGeneral’s Department, and officers for whom he is responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to say in advance what the attitude of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have a copy of the minutes of a European conference on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> held in central Europe in April and attended by christian socialists, social democrats and communist trade unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Attorney-General is determined, as stated in the Press, that no overseas crime syndicates should be allowed to operate in Australia, what is happening in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that entry visas are being or would be issued to these criminals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth, through its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls, can endeavour to keep a watch on persons who come into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who is the Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that there has been no jettisoning of security screening as the honourable senator suggested in his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question directed to me with regard to persons with known criminal records or believed to be implicated in criminal activities in another country coming to Australia, the general policy which is pursued by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is not to allow those persons to enter into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also confer with his colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to examine closely applications for entry to Australia from overseas people applying for professional shooters’ licences to ensure that they have no connection with organised criminal activity in the United States of America? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I will seek information for him from the Minister for Primary Industry, and I shall also make inquiries through the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on his behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether he was correctly reported as saying, in a recent statement he made on American crime syndicates, that overseas entertainers visiting Australia had been connected with criminal operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Minister’s statement last weekend about criminal operations on the part of overseas entertainers visiting Australia, what specific action is being taken by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to police the permits that are issued by the Department to foreign artists? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the other matters, which relate to the portfolio of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I think I should ascertain the position as accurately as I can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it a fact that 5 Australian citizens, McLeod, Van Moorst, Lehane and 2 others recently visited Hanoi? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three months ago I asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the following brief question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that  Senator McManus’s  statement was in the form of a question and a request to me as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I atn able, to inform the honourable senator that the matter is under the current attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, if the margin were not artificially maintained by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, we would have already reached the stage of being a disappearing nation and unable to sustain development at all, because a nation cannot develop if it has a receding population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 4th July 1 received an application from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who wanted to go to Ceduna and return by VIP aircraft on 3rd August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also know that when there is a problem with translation use is made of officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who have similar ability to translate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware of the statement made by  Mr Tonkin,  the Labor Premier of Western Australia, that his Government would encourage the Commonwealth Government specially to admit a number of Asian refugees from Uganda and that his Government would co-operate in settling them in Western Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask whether the Minister will consider Commonwealth participation in the existing nationwide legal aid schemes by providing an appropriate contribution in respect of legal aid services arising under Commonwealth legslation, such as bankruptcy, matrimonial causes, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and customs cases, broadcasting and television, marketing schemes, Commonwealth employees compensation cases and the like, thereby enabling the legal aid means test to be raised to make it available to a wider section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That factor is <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> at this time must not be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1972-73 <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target provides the best possible evidence that the Government has totally abandoned the policy of full employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 23 years of sustained growth in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programmes which were carried on with great enthusiasm to build a greater Australia, to hear this remark at this late hour of the day by a dying Opposition is fascinating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for 1972-73 provides for 140,000 migrants, the number initially programmed for last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find great difficulty in lining up what is Labor philosophy when  Mr Tonkin  in Western Australia and the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  are attempting to throw open the gates in those 2 States to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the easiest way of obtaining complete and accurate information is for the question to be placed on the notice paper so that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> may give it his attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator GREENWOOD- The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new advertising agency was appointed to handle the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> advertising account in Britain from 1st January 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirty advertising agencies indicated interest in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> advertising account when tenders were called in January 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters considered included the size of each agency and its capacity to handle accounts of similar size to that of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, its existing clients, possibilities of conflict of interest, terms of business, Australian associations (including Australian staff) and associated companies in Australia; but the over-riding concern was the quality of the agencies’ work and their approach to advertising Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is provided to the agency by senior officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in London. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 direct a further question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were representatives of State Education Departments, the Commonwealth Department of Education and Science, the Catholic Education Offices of Melbourne and Sydney, the Commonwealth Teaching Service, teacher registration authorities in Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, the National Council of Independent Schools and, of course, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defence and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> are to be maintained at their present high level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> decision is particularly significant as being diametrically opposed to the ALP policy on population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are to assist to increase our population by a sane, intelligent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which will maintain in essence the homogeneity of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The members of the ALP want to open the floodgates to foreign <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and at the same time restrict our natural increase in population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> seen reports of the court case involving  Mr Mirek  Mynar of Bankstown, New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it be that as a result of this case steps can be taken to improve the screening procedures, I am sure the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will be most anxious to take those steps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attorney-General a question which has certain <span class="highlight">immigration</span> overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister satisfied with the way that Commonwealth police and officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> were used at the behest of the New South Wales Government in the case of allegations of call-girl activities against certain Latin American migrants in Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To remove the unfair stigma that was placed on all Latin American female migrants, will the Minister consider the creation of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inquiries tribunal similar to that which has operated in Canada for the past 5 years so that an accused person facing deportation may produce a witness to refute allegations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked also whether we should have <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inquiries legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, of course, is a policy matter, initially for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise at this stage simply to request the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator DrakeBrockman)  to convey to the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  the need for a clear statement when we resume in about 10 days time on the situation of travellers, in view of the recent United Kingdom <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He argued initially that it was a matter for the Minister fo <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both Sydney and Melbourne termimals are designed to handle mass flows of passengers and new processing techniques have been adopted with excellent results and with the full cooperation of customs, health and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of Civil Aviation in conjunction with the other authorities - customs, health, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the airlines - is reviewing the problems shown up last Sunday in an endeavour to ensure that if this happens again passengers will move through the terminal without so much delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Commissioner and the previous Home Secretary,  Mr Maudling,  have had several talks during the last 2 years about Australians entering the United Kingdom, particularly when the British Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation was being drawn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Commissioner wrote to  Mr Maudling  about the treatment accorded to various Australians by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers at the port of entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span>,, policies and programmes have been of great, assistance in the building of houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has assisted Australia’s development in many ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s broad <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has been supported by all political parties in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this respect the Budget’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> proposals take note of the extent to which migrant supported population growth serves some of the country’s physical needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a great Australian economist,  Sir Douglas  Copland, pointed out, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has resulted in a ‘younging’ of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has helped to provide both impetus and means for the continued sound growth of the Australian economy in the face of widely varying and often adverse events in the world markets so important to us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for 1972-73 takes full account both of our immediate needs and our longer term national interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At no time during the past quarter of a century has <span class="highlight">immigration</span> been regarded as an end in itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve this overall rate of growth an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target of one per cent was set. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The population studies foreshadowed by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in July 1970 are now well under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has also commissioned a cost-benefit analysis of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under current Australian conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major study into the actual experiences of migrants in Australia is being developed by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in conjunction with the Bureau of Census and Statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, for example, we are deeply involved in work relating to migrant integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work of the Advisory Council and its committees has provided much of the information on which the Government has based its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Directly and indirectly, the Government has sponsored and initiated a considerable breadth of research into all aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Department of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, in addition to undertaking its own research has subsidised studies of the Australian Council of Educational Research and the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme for 1972- 73 is, therefore, in harmony both with our present needs and our future aspirations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that no visa applications were received with regard to the 2 Rhodesian golfers whom the Press has reported as being ineligible to come here, but a decision has been made to refuse approval for a Rhodesian team to come here to compete in the golf tournament if an application should bc made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

    <p>I have some information from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> regarding that report and I think it comprehends the question which has been asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The records of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> show that he departed from Australia on 30th May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has not at any time been informed by the police or by other authorities of any charges against  Mr Ford. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has said on numerous occasions that the reason why  Mr Rover’s  passport was withdrawn while he was in Canada was that it was not in the national interest for him to be able to travel under an Australian passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia, through the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has made its position plain that on its ordinary basis of admission, applicants among the expellees who come within the criteria that have been applied for entrance to Australia- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter part of the honourable senator’s question as to what additional or other measures are to be taken is something which I must leave to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to answer because it is unquestionably an area to which he is giving his consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure whether it is in the public interest to provide the details of precisely what is done by way of screening, but I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has said previously that the screening procedures are regularly checked to ensure that we do not have persons with known criminal records coming into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel I should forward the honourable senator’s question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> so that, if he can add to what I have had to say, he will be able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both under the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act and the Crimes Act there is power for persons to be deported from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also quite clear -  Senator McManus  dwelt on this and I am grateful to him for doing so because some of the things he revealed shocked me - that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> screening, as I have been saying and suspecting for a long time, has been faulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thank heavens, even though it has taken 23 years and we are on the eve of an election, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  has brought down some new methods regarding both education and screening of migrants, and I agree with those methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I revert to the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> knew that this sort of thing was going on but never sought to discourage it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some years ago  Mr Lynch  as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> belatedly conceded that some of the people who were refused naturalisation were connected with a certain organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the way I approached the matter with the predecessors of the Attorney-General and with Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to know what successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have done about the files on these cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is  Senator Greenwood  prepared to come clean and say to me: ‘Some inflamatory statements were made to Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> by one or two chaplains who mixed their religious beliefs with their political views’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And I would ask whether the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is permitting the leaders of some of these groups to come into this country - and I include Fabian Lovokovic and  Mr Rover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is essentially a matter for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to ascertain this information from his records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, either itself or through the Committee on Overseas Qualifications, maintain a blacklist of colleges and universities in Britain and the United States of America which award sub-standard degrees; if so, will the Minister make that list public so that potential migrants will know where they stand in relation to the acceptance of their qualifications in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To safeguard the interests of migrants with professional qualifications, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> encourages them to have their qualifications assessed by the appropriate Australian authority before committing themselves to migration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of what we are told today, our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme and our natural increase will never, on present tendencies, ensure that we will have a rate of growth sufficient to develop this country and to maintain th: standards that exist today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Members of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council are, in the main, representatives of community organisations and the 5 women members presently serving on the Council represent a large crosssection of the Australian community - including 3 major women’s associations with  a  combined membership of more than 940,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 12th September the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  supplied me with an answer to a question about the number of applications that had been received by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for working permits to be issued to foreign entertainers to perform in Australia in each of the last 3 years and as to the number that had been approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Party that cynically brought in this motion today is dedicated to the complete destruction - the dismantling - of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even on the recent say so of its own leader  (Mr Whitlam)  it is dedicated to the abolition of the assisted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will do so by the very destruction of  2  things - by the destruction of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme which will slow down immensely any expansion of the steel or other industries, and its own platform which says that it aims to establish an integrated iron and steel industry under public ownership and control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that with this type of legislation under which we are sort of a generous godfather giving handouts to the States, there will be a much more reasonable distribution and that better facilities will be provided to the States to enable them to bear the growing burden of responsibilities that are being handed on to them both in tennis of the repayment of interest charges and in coping with Commonwealth policies such as the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, which should be the responsibility of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> provide, either directly or indirectly by grants to the Slates for the purpose, interpreters to provide a service for those migrants who are hospitalised; if not, will the Minister give urgent consideration to providing interpreters in major public hospitals as a contribution to the health and well-being, both physical and mental, of those migrants who are not yet proficient in English. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has a responsibility for providing interpreter services to meet needs arising directly from its specific functions, we do not believe that interpreter services should be solely the responsibility of government, and it is significant to note the extent to which commerce and industry is already active in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rules published in Britain which have the effect of treating Australian citizens in the same way as aliens, does the Government intend to alter its treatment of British citizens who come to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think a question was asked by my colleague  Mr Hayden  in another place of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Dr Forbes)  who represents in that place the Minister for Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it adopted and carried forward the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies of the Federal Labor Government ot the preceding period it rejected that Government’s propositions relating to decentralisation and regional development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very big proportion of that growth came about as a result of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unfortunately the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme that has been in operation for the last 25 years has not benefited Tasmania to the same extent as other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> should advise migrants from countries such as Greece that have compulsory military service that irrespective of whether they are naturalised in Australia they retain their former nationality and on returning to their former country, irrespective of how long they had been away from it, will be required to undergo military training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is concerned, I am surprised that the honourable senator should suggest that persons who are going overseas to countries such as Yugoslavia or Greece are not informed of the fact that they should before they leave Australia ascertain whether they may not be required to do national service if they go to those countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I had previously dealt with the first matter when in response to a question placed on notice on 11th May 1972 by  Senator Mulvihill,  I gave an assurance that Commonwealth Police and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officers had not been used in a sordid battle of call-girl cartels and that the records of the women concerned, who were not residents of Australia, made it quite clear that they should not be granted extensions of stay (Hansard, page 137). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The consideration of  Mr Silver’s  application included the aspect of his connection with  Scientology  as well as the other normal considerations on which <span class="highlight">immigration</span> decisions are normally based, and his application was refused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our recommendations cover aspects of foreign policy, trade, Australian natural resources, investment in Australian industries, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the need for greater understanding between the peoples of both countries, and comments on proposals which have been voiced for a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation between our 2 countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730227_senate_28_s55/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: In view of the reservations expressed by the honourable Peter Shore in the House of Commons about the advantages to Commonwealth citizens contained in revisions to the British <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws, can the Prime Minister’s Department provide an early evaluation of the new British laws as they will apply to Australian nationals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in another place said that there is no possibility - to use the article’s words - of any little Pakistan being set up on the Ord. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will refer the question to my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and ask him for a detailed reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a recent statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the Government’s policy is to abandon the oath cf allegiance at naturalisation ceremonies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Has this policy been implemented by any ministerial diktat or does the Government intend to give Parliament an opportunity of debating this important change in policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that this matter was first drawn to the attention of the Government by the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the election of the Labor Government it was discussed, among other matters connected with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and the Labor Government decided to adopt it as its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am reminded by  Senator Cavanagh  that at the time such recommendation was made  Senator Davidson  was  chairman  of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am further given to understand that the advice forthcoming from the Attorney-General to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about this matter - the Attorney-General can correct me or indicate otherwise - was that a constitutional question was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> looked at the criteria that it applies, and some families and some diplomats were allowed to stay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  who in this chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  referred to the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and to myself as its  chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister said that the words were included in advice and recommendations received from the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council of which, he said, I was the  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister knows that the  chairman  is an appointment made by the Minister of the day, therefore my appointment as  .Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council -.ceased with the advent of the new Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Among the voluminous documents on Suljak and the Australian branch of the terrorist organisation UHNj which I have tabled today is a letter dated 30th May 1972 from  Mr Davis,  Commissioner of Commonwealth Police, to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A brochure produced by the Special Reports Branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in August 1972 on Croatian extremist activities makes special reference to the UHNj, its organisation in Australia, its activities and its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a long and carefully argued submission to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> dated 1 2th November 1972,  Senator Greenwood  reversed the priorities as between the interests of Australia and those of an obvious Croatian terrorist in favour of the latter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The chief law officer of Australia must have been familiar with the decision of the High Court in the case of Znaty v.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Judgment in this case was delivered on 25th February 1972, that is, some 9 months prior to the letter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> urging him not to deport Marincic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we assume that he was familiar with this decision and surely he would not undertake to advise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> without familiarising himself with the uptodate state of the law regarding <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters, we can only reach one conclusion about his conduct in this matter: In order to protect a terrorist from deportation, he misinformed the Minister responsible for the issuance of a deportation order about the legal consequences for the terrorist of such an order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So far as the latter portion of the honourable senator’s question is concerned - that is, the point regarding the tightening up of the screening processes that take place - 1 understand that my colleague  Mr Grassby,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has taken steps along these lines already and also is engaged in preparing a list of people who have come to Australia as migrants and who have committed serious criminal breaches of Australian law with a view to taking prospective action in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been informed - I take it that my information is correct - that the background of this legislation is that prior to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> being given this power certain persons were enticing people of Aboriginal descent overseas and displaying them in circuses and sideshows and treating them in much the same way as wild animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were asked to suggest one way of destroying Australia’s growth, destroying the real living standards of its people and destroying its productivity I would say: ‘Right, attack the idea of a selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> system and introduce in its place a non-selective system which would disregard skills.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to see growth in this country by the reintroduction of a selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> system in order that we bring from abroad people with the best of skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will do the gravest possible disservice to this country if it carries out its promise to wipe out the assisted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It derives from the letter I forwarded to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which last week was incorporated in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also say, to illustrate the character of the case sought to be made, that the opinion I expressed as Attorney-General on the question of the grant of a passport to Jure Maric, which was in any event refused, by the responsible Minister, namely the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, was not included in the tabled documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I retained my copy of my notation on the 3- page submission dated 6th July, wherein I expressed my views and acknowledged completely that the decision was for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have we not heard from him about the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> brochure? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did  Senator Greenwood  make no mention of this brochure put out by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which also set out information, chapter and verse, about the United Croats of West Germany? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did he not answer the charge that there is a clear and recent High Court case which establishes the fact that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities in Australia do not have to deport a man to the country of his origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, the case is reported and it establishes that  Senator Greenwood’s  advice to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was given on a false basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 29th March the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  also pointed out in relation to deportations that each case is to be treated on its merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only decision that can be made is made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the advice of many organs of government and we will be proceeding with justice and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For more than 5 years I stressed to various Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and various Attorneys-General that they could defuse a situation that was developing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Referring back to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, there were pockets of malcontents amongst some of the Croatians in South America, West Germany and other places who came here as migrants due to earlier lax screening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to incriminate public servants but I know that senior officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will confirm what I am saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have known a number of people who were given adverse reports by ASIO but when I, and no doubt other senators too, took up their cases, even on a number of occasions under nonLabor Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, we were suddenly proved correct and citizenship granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the submission of all these reports was prompted by the letter from  Mr Lynch,  then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and the letter from  Mr McMahon,  then Minister for Foreign Affairs, both directed to the Attorney-General, to see whether there could be more effective action in stamping out terrorism, and sent in about December 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, too, of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> document to which he referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did  Mr Lynch  say on only 3rd December 1969 when he was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Minister in charge of a department which had made other submissions on the existence of other Croatian terrorist organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18th October 1972 - and this was not so close to the election that the former AttorneyGeneral could not act on it - the Assistant Director of the Special Reports Branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> made certain statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that probably our Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was lax right from the start. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood admitted in his statement that he had the power to invoke the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act, which this Government cannot use because of its total opposition to the use of those powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of ridding this country of the danger that existed, the previous Government -  Senator Greenwood  states this in a letter to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> - simply tried to protect these people by keeping them here at that stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy tabled a letter written in May 1972 by the Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police Force to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18th October 1972, the Assistant-Director of the Special Reports Branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recommended  Marincic’s  deportation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer continues:  1  understand from the Department  of  <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that some action is being contemplated as to his authority to remain in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole question is that the then Attorney-General, who acknowledged the existence of terrorist organisations in Australia, while saying ‘We leave it to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>’, was making an appeal to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to protect this individual - whether he is in gaol or not - despite the danger to the safety of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the judgment of the High Court the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> could deport him to any country which would have him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Greenwood  appealed to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to protect this man from need never have been a threat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have appealed to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> not to deport him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has said that 300 people are under consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been grave disquiet in the migrant community - not only the Croatian community but the migrant community at large - because they do not fully understand the niceties of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give due credit to the right honourable Arthur Augustus Calwell for initiating a splendid <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Opperman;  the former Minister for Social Services,  Mr Wentworth;  the infamous Douglas Darby, M.L.A., from New South Wales; the former Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  who coming home from a game of squash or tennis a year or two ago said: ‘They seemed a good bunch of boys with a good cause, having some fun’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the maintenance of friendly relations with that country is an important part of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am anxious to prevent any recurrence of behaviour either on the part of Yugoslavs or any other national minority groups, which adversely affects our external relations, and I have asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to consider what positive steps might be taken to restrain them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have discussed the question of prosecution under both the Passports Act and Aliens Act with the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and it was agreed that I should bring the question of prosecution to your attention so that you could discuss the matter with your colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why did it not take action on the report by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Lynch,  to the then AttorneyGeneral? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the documents that  Senator Murphy  has tabled dating from 1963 - they include letters from a gentleman in Argentina to the then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies; from the then AttorneyGeneral,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, to the then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies; from the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Lynch,  to the then Attorney-General,  Mr Hughes  - say that these people were concerned at the extent of the growth of terrorist organisations and terrorist activities - I include both those things - in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730405_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator McCLELLAND - The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  has endeavoured to alleviate the fears of these people by suggesting that only in cases which are proved may action be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know when that time comes, from the pledges of both the Attorney-General and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  that something will be done about that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had an opportunity last year when, because of the pressure brought upon them by the wine grape growing industry itself and, in particular, the efforts of the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and the former honourable member for Sturt,  Mr Foster,  the then Minister for Primary Industry and the former government had to capitulate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My interest in the report springs not only from its content but also from the reference in its conclusions to the Migrant Education Committee of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like  Senator Davidson,  I emphasise the point that when the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council holds its next meeting in mid-July, no doubt we will be watching the responses of the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is as though the concern of the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs had not been put seriously to paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, which has a special reports branch and which is interested in the question of whether there are terrorist organisations in Australia, is also totally satisfied that such organisations exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface I refer to a lengthy answer he gave me to a question I asked about the status of Australians in Britain under the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission of Population Growth and the American Future in its report on 27th March to the  President  and Congress of the United States commented ‘Even if <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from abroad ceased and couples had only 2 children on the average - just enough to replace themselves - our population would continue to grow for about 70 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the last 3 or 4 weeks I have represented the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  at a number of functions and the cry of the people attending them has been: ‘When will the pensions legislation get into orbit?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I enter the debate simply to point out that, with respect to the reference to ethnic groups and the alleged vital importance of this issue, the fact of the matter is that a delegation comprising Messrs Cujes, Alagich, Bizjak, Dezlin, Kosovich and Spiciar, saw the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the Migration Act a person may be deported only if he is a prohibited immigrant, he is an alien or a migrant who has been convicted of a serious offence or he is an alien or migrant whose conduct has been such that, in the opinion of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, he ought not to be allowed to remain in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The bombing attack last week on the Yugoslav Embassy in Canberra (which was apparently intended to coincide’ with the Yugoslav National Day on 28lh November), the evidence of a deliberate attempt to fire the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Offices at Barton on the evening of 1st December, the bombing ‘ of the Yugoslav Consulate-General in Sydney earlier- iri the year are evidence of a pattern of ‘extremist activity which should be capable of preventive measures by the law authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The details supplied to me by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are that the Bonfield family arrived in Melbourne on 28th February 1961  -  some 12 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, 2 of the children had come to the notice of authorities for what might be called antisocial behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A month ago J bad the opportunity to recommend to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  a Yugoslav for appointment to the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were  Senator Neil  O’sullivan;  Senator Wright,  to whom I have referred;  Mr Alec  Downer, who was a Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Menzies Government and later High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom; and  Mr Joske,  Q.C., as he was at that time, but who is now  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Joske of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government’s decision to extend the present wheat stabilisation scheme for a further 12 months suggest that he believed that he had insufficient time in which to make up his mind about the terms of a new scheme, or was the influence on caucus of the Minister for Northern Development and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> responsible for the decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they do not seek registration they can, after 5 years here, simply notify the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that they want to be citizens; and they thereupon become citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is intended to publicise this change throughout Australia and of course people seeking to migrate to Australia will be thoroughly informed by officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is just on 25 years since the first Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, now the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, introduced, with great and justifiable pride, a Bill which for the first time created in law the status  of  Australian citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is most necessary that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies which were pursued by the previous Government continue to be persued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly we are looking at somewhat reduced numbers to meet the economic situation of li to 2 years ago, but unless we have an active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which brings us skills and assistance in the labour field we will not have the generation within our own economy on the local scene that we need to have to continue the growth that has marked our economy in the last couple of decades. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>haps the time when the existence of this provision in the legislation did manifest itself on the ethnic group was when  Mr Oppermann,  as he then was, was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sena.or Murphy, and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  have yet to be nailed about taking away a person’s passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can imagine that  Senator Greenwood  will say that he did not do it and thai  Mr Lynch,  the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, also will say that he did not take his passport from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 sympathise with the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> when 1 think of the people who were denied citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went along to the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a week of  Mr Grassby  becoming Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I took a delegation to see him and the first thing its members put up was that they wanted the removal of these iniquitious provisions of the Crimes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Very soon after the previous government was defeated one of the first acts of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was to naturalise a migrant who had been refused naturalisation for about 19 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Government’s announcement of an emergency drive in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to recruit an additional 14,500 migrants by the end of June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister concede that long term planning in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for migrants with required skills for Australia’s employment needs is a desirable objective? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally agree, as I am sure the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> agrees, that long term planning of the migration program is an essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is working on this matter at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, what will be the fate of these facilities and the people involved if and when the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is suddenly switched off? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matters raised in the honourable senator’s questions are outside my immediate knowledge, They are matters for the administrative machinery of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and for my colleague in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister  representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McCLELLAND- The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs will, however, provide for: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, refers to the vexed subject of dual nationality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our great development has taken place in about the last 25 to 30 years since we began a very vigorous <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and so increased rapidly the population of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earlier <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this country took place, in an era of larger families which coincided with the tail end of the United States development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The population, as we all appreciate, will not develop naturally because of the circumstances of family life which have changed so much from what they were in the first stage of our development and since the major period of the massive development of the United States when that country had an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rate similar to the one we might be running now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must depend even more heavily on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we rely more heavily on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, we will want the proposed Cities Commission to assist in the necessary development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General whether he will examine the ethics that should apply to the custody of a post office mail box and see whether the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association which operates post office box 322, Crows Nest, New South Wales, can continue to use postal facilities for the purpose of perverted racialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, in Asian and in African countries we have had difficulty in obtaining architects and matters have had to be dealt with between the Department of Works, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and all the rest of the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Primary Industry: Is it a fact that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in an election advertisement last year stated that $500m provided to farmers at 3 per cent interest would cost the Government only $15m to subsidise the interest rate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party cannot accept what  Mr Grassby  is leading it into on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intended to enter the debate mainly to reply to some of the excursions on the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program that emerged from the speech by  Senator Carrick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now  I  want to reply to the statements made by  Senator Carrick  in relation to the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had to make a decision about our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> inflow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we as a Government, and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  - and for that matter the whole Ministry - are not dazzled by statistics alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that irrespective of whether we have in mind the Labor Ministry, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  his committee, or the whole Caucus, we may have to take a calculated risk in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and perhaps face the accusation by employers that there are not enough workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to put the record straight in relation to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, that is a matter for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  whom I do not represent in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, made some estimates amongst which he said that ‘each migrant was a gain to Australia because of his education, training in industrial skills and the incidental costs which had been paid for by another nation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we discuss a measure of this kind we discuss it against the background of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, because <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies determine the number and the quality or style of people that come into Australia and therefore the numbers and style and quality of people are very much related to the whole matter of citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is perhaps not an occasion on which to discuss in total and extended detail the Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is pertinent to refer to a statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  that the first priority -would be given to the reunion of immediate family members - husband, wife, parents and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implication carried by the statement is that previous administrations had not taken these humanitarian causes into account; but the more important implication, as I see it - the idea of a total migrant program based on sponsorship by migrants already living here - is not one which I think is good for Australia’s development or total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should never relinquish its responsibility so that it allows the size and structure of such an important legislative area as its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to be determined solely by unco-ordinated decisions of individuals here and overseas so that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake is determined by the wishes and maybe the needs of people living here who wish to bring in their kith and kin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These studies were being undertaken and were announced by a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Lynch)  in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also in February of this year the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> spoke about what he called the nation’s first emergency interpreter service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a speech made by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Dr <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to existing interpreter services provided by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> an on-call telephone interpreter service will be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As most members know, I had the privilege of serving with the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council - a council which, may I say, was originally established by a Labor administration and one which has known the benefit of advice from a wide range of citizens coming from diverse disciplines and interests and all of them acutely involved in the welfare of citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not make this registration, after 5 years all they have to do is notify the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and by the act of notification they automatically become Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not without its importance to note that the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, to whom we give so much credit and honour for establishing Australia’s post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, had as the cornerstone of the program he envisaged integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> he emphasised on many occasions the importance of bringing migrants to this country who shared with us a common language and a common tradition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am indeed surprised because I think it will hinder <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and what is more, I think it will hinder citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program cannot be turned off and on at will and just as an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program cannot be left to the process which remains in the hands of relatives, nor can it be the subject of factors which ignore the very basic ingredients of nation building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those factors are part of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which can keep Australia as not only a stable, human community but also one that is economically advancing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In expanding a country by an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy there is some wisdom in that procedure because integration is so much easier where the cultural backgrounds of the people involved are identical or almost identical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent years there has been more tolerance towards <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from countries where the cultural background is distinctively different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that those who have studied the problem of a developing nation such as ours in regard to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have always realised the necessity for a gradual change along the lines of what has been happening in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and we are forced in our attempts to achieve the rate of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia which is the minimum that we can sustain because of the falling birth rate in Australia, to resort to programs of persuasion which have not engendered the desire to come to Australia into the people who have the capacity to tackle the immense task of starting life in a new country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those, countries there are none of the factors which should inhibit us in broadening our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have argued with Japanese friends who have queried our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and have wrongly designated them as a White Australia policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we believe in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at all we do not believe in it just as a way of exploiting other people by persuading them to come here and to give us their all and not to give them anything in return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may quote the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  on this point, other countries which do not require a person to renounce their allegiance to their country of origin encompass New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, Ireland, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a sort of situation which I know the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in its wisdom has been trying to overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should view this amending legislation in conjunction with many other reforms in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> (field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation will do to the Queen, metaphorically speaking, what that man did to Charles I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with the commendation made by the Minister of the right honourable Arthur Augustus Calwell, the architect of our original <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>established in dealing with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the enormous work which he did and the tremendous benefit which his work in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has brought to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, there would be one point on which all 60 of us would agree, and that is that this nation will be eternally indebted to Arthur Calwell for his work on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I add that the work of Arthur Calwell was carried on very well, very successfully, very intelligently and very humanely by a succession of Liberal Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope we can abandon all the nonsense, humbug and hypocrisy and get back to the earlier pristine days when the Labor Party had ideas, put up by Arthur Calwell, when <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was a reality and when the job done for this nation was one which we remember with pride and thankfulness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply - Representing asI do the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby),  until  Senator Hannan  had spoken I had intended to say that I appreciated the amicable way in which this very important Bill had been discussed by representatives of all political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  thinks that it causes confusion, surely that confusion could be removed by the Government’s own proposal to change the style and title of the Queen and by using the very words proposed in the Opposition’s amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite have referred to Arthur Calwell as a former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General explanations of the reasons for the proposed changes are contained in the second reading speech that I made on this Bill on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Government are not opposed to promising a review of the oath of allegiance at some time in the future after the new Royal Style and Titles have been introduced, if this is necessary, but for the present time strongly wish the oath now proposed in the Schedule to this Bill to be enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it a fact that the Minister, speaking in the Senate on 17 May, said that the Government’s proposal for the common period of residence before Australian citizenship could be sought would be 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister explain to the Senate, the statement made yesterday by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the waiting period for Australian citizenship for all nationalities had been reduced to one year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within 3 years of being elected to Parliament in 1940, Arthur Calwell rose to the Ministry, acting as Minister for Information from 1 943 and also as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> from July 1945 until the defeat of the Government in December 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he did in administering the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> portfolio is something which is remembered with admiration by all in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was the architect of Australia’s postwar <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, a program which brought many thousands of Europeans into Australia following the war a program which has enriched our culture and influenced the very fabric of our lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When appointed Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in 1 945, Arthur Calwell devoted his energy and undoubted administrative ability to the task of planning an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program on a scale no other country had attempted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and refer to an announcement of the proposed immigrant intake of 1 10,000 for the ensuing year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was recognised by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that one factor that had to be taken into account was the serious wastage of migrants which had occurred in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand it has been established by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council that over the past 5 years there was a 2.25 per cent loss of people who had come here and who, for whatever reason, had decided to return to their original homelands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out by my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, people are not available to be ordered around like shock troops at the drop of an order, and availability of migrants is a very real consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has assured me that the present program is a flexible one and that it will be subject to review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730821_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> approves of what seems to be a blatant act of discrimination against a migrant wishing to serve his adopted country in this way? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I present also a transcript of the conference held at Brisbane on 1 1 May 1973 between the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and State Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  in speaking to the Committee in another place said nothing at all that would be helpful about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 25 years we have built enormous national strength from our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are words which we repeat often and which may even be described as cliches, but all of us in this Senate and all citizens of Australia have known the benefits of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  has been very conciliatory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Davidson  has had friendships with personnel of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have listened to the debate with considerable interest because I have the responsibility of being the representative in this chamber of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might also add that it is the subject of associated initiatives by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying, this matter is also the subject of associated initiatives by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who, I would like to place on record, is on behalf of the Government sparing no effort in ensuring as a first step that migrants who acquire Australian citizenship and who are still regarded by their former homeland as being its citizens are able, where the law of that country so provides, to divest themselves of that citizenship if they so wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that this matter is the subject of scrutiny by one of the joint committees of the Parliament, that it is probably also the subject of scrutiny, as  Senator Byrne  has said, by a standing committee of the Senate, and that it is also, of course, the subject of very close scrutiny by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my second reading speech on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate on the Citizenship Bill I indicated, on behalf of the Government and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, that the Government was not opposed to promising a review of the oath of allegiance contained in the Citizenship Bill after the new royal style and titles had been introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently, in a public statement made on 7 June, my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> confirmed this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also like to give to the Committee some additional information that has been made available to me by my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  as to why the Government believes it essential to omit the words ‘renouncing all other allegiance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason for this is that the report of a survey on migrants carried out by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the first half of 1971 included the following statement:   it was found to be difficult to explicitly renounce allegiance to one’s country of birth which still held great emotional significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In January 1973 a committee on citizenship of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Council unanimously recommended to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the oath of affirmation should no longer require the applicants to renounce their former allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A recent study of the citizenship legislation of 19 Commonwealth countries that was made by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on behalf of the Minister revealed that 1 7 of those Commonwealth countries require an oath of allegiance but of that number only four require renunciation of other allegiance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As long ago as 1963- a decade ago- the then committee on naturalisation of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council recommended the same action as the citizenship committee recommended in January 1973: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a recent report to my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> gave the following considered opinion: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These figures are taken from the consolidated statistics of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am conscious of the difficulties that face the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland)  in such a technical field in which he is representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  and attempting to command an adequate assessment of the difficulties of this position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the survey that has been taken by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to which I referred earlier, it is obvious that a large number of those people are affected by that clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of all that, what incredible folly it was for the Government on coming into office to knock down the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in such a dramatic if not hysterical manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government finds itself in the position where it has to turn around and gradually get itself back into the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> picture again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick referred to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the specific matter of the passport which has been raised by the honourable senator, I think it is proper that that should be referred to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for Labour and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  might be induced, as I think they are beginning to be induced, to let some more people in to help the steel industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-These matters are not within my immediate knowledge, other than the fact that I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has given permission to BHP to engage in the recruitment of migrant labour from abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer the question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for appropriate advice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The design was selected by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the opportunity was taken to improve the design. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By administrative arrangements made earlier this year, the 8 overseas Press and information posts that previously were operated by the publicity branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and the 9 officers attached thereto, were transferred to the Australian Information Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> information will remain an important aspect of the future activities of the Australian Information Service posts involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the reopening of communications with Chile and the presence of Australia’s Ambassador to Chile in Canberra, can the Minister now state, firstly, whether approaches have been made to our offices in Chile, either on a diplomatic or <span class="highlight">immigration</span> basis, from Chilean political refugees for sanctuary in Australia and, secondly, whether Australia has at a United Nations level sought to activate the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which always appears to roll rapidly in the face of left wing totalitarianism but never in the case of right wing totalitarianism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that this Government cut <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and reduced the available work force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A banking conference should be held and there should be an increase in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  said that he brought about this change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill,  Mr President,  seeks an amendment of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act 1971 which, in defining in section 3 capital equipment of an educational nature’ which could be financed under the child program, specifically excluded any building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A survey of child migrant education in schools of high migrant density in Melbourne which the Government initiated late in 1972, and undertaken by the Victorian Education Department, the Catholic Education Office in Victoria, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Department of Education, revealed serious inadequacies with respect both to accommodation and supply of teachers, which are related problems, and some shortages of equipment and materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The findings of the Melbourne survey were amply confirmed by the task force which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  established early this year to identify and report on special problems confronting migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cabinet on 14 May 1973 approved a joint submission by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  to extend the child migrant education program to include provision for supplementary class-room accommodation by way of demountable or portable class-rooms, where this was necessary as an emergency measure to ensure that adequate instruction could be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 makes the point that the principal Act when amended will be known as the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> (Education) Act 1971-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were ascertained as a result of the inquiry which was undertaken by the Victorian Department of Education, the Catholic Education Office in Victorian, the Department of Education and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I intervene briefly in the debate to state that the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council- I know that  Senator Davidson  would concur with this - was equally concerned about the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is disgraceful that this position has been permitted to continue for so long because there has been a need for special classrooms for learning possibly back to the early 1 950s- since the late Arthur Calwell introduced the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not criticise the Government’s attitude in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Is he now in a position to indicate whether <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and diplomatic representatives in Santiago have been given instructions to assist Chileans who may be apprehensive of the current political situation in that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who introduced this Bill in another place- and I suppose that what he had to say was said here- said that if the Australian taxpayer pays for these inspections it is tantamount to that taxpayer subsidising the consumption of Australian meat overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, concerns the ban which has been placed on the Rhodesian delegates of mixed racial origin who wish to attend the fourteenth triennial conference of the Associated Country Women of the World which is to be held in Perth in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Minister’s assurance of 9 October as reported at page 1082 of Hansard that the Australian Government has made known to the Soviet Government Australia ‘s belief in the fundamental human right of free <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of a nation’s citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the making of its attitude known to the Soviet Government, did the Australian Government specify restrictions on Jewish <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from the Soviet Union as an instance of denial of this fundamental human right? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Australian Government protest, that is, did it make a formal statement of dissent or disapproval, to the Soviet Government specifically concerning that Government’s refusal to allow free <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of Jewish citizens of the Soviet Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he have tabled and made available for the Parliament to peruse the evidence- I repeat, the evidence- on which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Services and Property base their allegations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Leader of the Government table as soon as possible the evidence upon which the Minister for Services and Property and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> based their allegations and upon which the Government plans to base its legislation concerning the matters he referred to? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present the final report by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reports had been submitted to it not only by the Commissioner of Police but by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> prior to the statements that there was no credible evidence of any terrorist organisation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-No doubt the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has seen reports that following the Prime Minister’s visit to China a significant number of Chinese migrants may be coming to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principal Act was introduced by the right honourable Arthur Calwell who was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it would provide data for an analysis of Australia ‘s alien population so that the government of the day could implement its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy on lines which were considered to be sound and scientific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, many of the phrases, ideas and ideals which were used in the early days of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy no longer apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this extent, I am interested to read of the report which was placed before the Senate a few weeks ago on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who formerly had the privilege of being Chairman of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, I was associated with the first steps of this inquiry back in September 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the evidence which was put before the Committee of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council suggested that departures generally resulted from a number of factors and a complexity of factors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interestingly enough, a significant number of people concerned in this study were described as those who used <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia to try to escape personal and environment problems at home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to contrive a labour shortage by cutting back <span class="highlight">immigration</span>’- and in fact it has done that- ‘and then with inflation running at Christmas time and diminishing people’s spending, we are going to plead emotionally to the people for power over prices and we hope, emotionally, that we will get it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council I get correspondence, as does my colleague  Senator Davidson-  I pay tribute to  Senator Davidson  as  Chairman  of that Council and he would agree with me if he were in this chamber now- from people in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My colleague,  Senator Mulvihill,  has been raising this matter not only with me as Minister for the Media, but also with my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and, I understand, prior to our assuming office, with Ministers of the previous <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Officers of the Board and of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are looking at the matter to see what sort of public access can be given to these migrant groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it arbitrary or excessive power to amend the Crimes Act and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act so that no longer naturalised Australian citizens will be eligible for deportation from this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not mind, and I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  does not mind, if we have to pick up the tab to ensure that the wage claims of these people are met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has cut back on our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program at a time when it should have been maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In times past Government members have talked about the clear economic and social advantages of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that they are contradicting their own statements when they contribute towards a winding down of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call for a reactivation of the program of overseas recruitment so that we can have a proper relationship between <span class="highlight">immigration</span>- the intake of personnel- and the level of economic activity and development within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I charge the Government that it made no serious examination of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> requirements before it set out on a program for the intake of new settlers which was unrealistic and quite unfair to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  has stated on a number of occasions that he does not want an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which is simply identified with a labour program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Corporation, in conjunction with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, direct migrants to move into this area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, does it indicate that there is likely to be a stepping-up of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask those honourable senators and other honourable senators opposite to cast their minds back to their criticims of us in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 4 December 1973,  Senator Durack  directed a question to me in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> concerning new Australian citizenship laws and the advertisements appearing in newspapers throughout Australia concerning the application of those laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a so-called answer that I received yesterday from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to a question I had asked expressing some concern about advertisements in the Australian Press regarding the application of the new citizenship laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the vast majority of British subjects in Australia came to this country from the British Isles and that they are not likely to appreciate having their status referred to as ‘quaint’ by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not immediately aware of the answer to the honourable senator’s question because I only represent the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that some countries which impose these bars on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and emigration of their citizens and claim that there is some specially dangerous position in which they find themselves which forces them to impose these bars on the free egress and access of their citizens, ought to look at Israel which they criticise so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately that happened  Mr Grassby,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, said that Solzhenitsyn and his family could come to Australia to live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are not careful they will find that they will get into the same jam as they got into in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deliberately reduced the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rate, knowing that by so doing it would reduce the work force in the basic industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would severely cut back the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, having planned the industries to absorb those migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that another of the causes of the difficult situation stems from the Government’s total disregard of the importance of an appropriate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has varied in style and importance over the 25 years that we have known it since the end of World War II. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> were trained not only to assist but also to counsel and to render such services to potential migrants as would help them to fulfil their own desires in life in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proof of the satisfactory administration of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program of the previous Government is seen in the great number of migrants in this country who fit very truly into that category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two years before the election the Prime Minister in a telecast made it plain that his Government when in office would not have an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that would benefit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Prime Minister adopted a negative attitude by saying that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would decline anyhow and that people with qualifications could do better in their own countries than here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that statement by the Prime Minister is a sharp difference of expression from that of his Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Grassby)  who more than once has praised the skills- the very many skills, to use the Prime Minister’s own words- that migration has brought to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government has deliberately cut off an orderly <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and I suggest that one of its main reasons for doing so has been to create a scarcity of labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The cutting and cancelling of a decent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy for Australia has meant that the Government has cut right across the efficient contribution of our basic industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, by comparison with earlier administrations there has been literally no <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as such and certainly many fewer non-Europeans have come to Australia under the present Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As proof of the Government’s opposition to an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy I refer the Senate to an extract from the ‘Fabian Newsletter’ of August 1970 which contains an article written by  Mr Everingham,  who at that time was the member for Capricornia and who is now a Minister in the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> increases the anti-communist movement, the anti-Russian movement and the anti-labor movement, thereby committing us more uncompromisingly to capitalist policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that by turning down an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and cutting out an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program the Government is trying to persuade the people that to reduce <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the right thing to do when really it is the wrong thing to do and it is, of course, for very much the wrong reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been steadied down or decreased at a time when there are very big demands on industry to produce those things which are now in very short supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has not assisted the sound development of our economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are deliberately deciding that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> numbers will be geared to the number of jobs available and not to exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it a fact that during a visit to Italy  Mr Grassby,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, invited  Mr Francesco  Catanzarati, an Opposition member of the Italian Parliament, to visit Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware whether my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> extended an invitation to the Italian gentleman referred to by the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> information offices were transferred from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the Australian Information Service and this has meant that we have been able to establish additional offices in Rome and Vienna. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>4m now sought for capital works and services, the major requirements are $2m for emergency classroom accommodation for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, $l.lm for the purchase of residential properties at overseas posts, $33m for the Postmaster-General’s Department to meet the cost of new wage rates and improved conditions of service together with increases in the prices of materials, $7.2m for the Department of Services and Property, of which $ 1.7m is for acquisitions of freehold properties in the Australian Capital Territory and $4.1m for acquisition of properties for overseas posts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person for whom the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> considers it to be undesirable, in the context of Australia’s international relations, to request other countries to provide free passage, protection and assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-69-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-69-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) What were the names of the four Yugoslav persons deported from Australia between 5 December 1972 and 30 September 1973 under Section 12 of the Migration Act as mentioned by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in an answer to a question asked by  Senator Greenwood  in 1 973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-69-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> prepared a reply to the question before Parliament was prorogued but it was not subsequently included in Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-69-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is supplementary to the question asked earlier by  Senator Jessop  in relation to the Philips Industries Ltd plant at Hendon in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the scheme is not yet under way, its preliminary organisation is being considered by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and if anybody is made redundant I would think that the legislation would be brought forward in a hurry and would cover the position of workers made redundant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has stated that in his opinion it is likely that unemployment will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, who could never be described as a cheerful soul, is even more pessimistic than usual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It decided that it would cut and virtually eliminate the European assisted <span class="highlight">immigration</span> scheme which was a great scheme for the development of Australia and a scheme which selected a homogeneous cross-section of workers for jobs here and brought them into the basic steel, automotive and building industries of Australia so the people could have a flow of steel, cars, building nails and ordinary fencing wire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a statement made by the Prime Minister at his Press conference last week in which he said that the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had fallen down very badly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government closed the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> as a matter of Government policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, can the Minister tell the Senate why the Government felt that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had fallen down very badly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this assertion refer to the work performed by the former and immediate past Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What were the areas of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> activity in which the ‘falling down very badly ‘ took place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of closing down the separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, that of course was a matter of Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether the Prime Minister intended in any way to reflect upon the administration of the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, I can safely answer the honourable senator by saying no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Government’s decision to amalgamate the Department of Labor and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, what steps have been taken to re-allocate the functions of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now about a month since the Prime Minister announced that  Mr Clyde  Cameron would take over the duties formerly performed by  Mr Grassby  and that the 2 departments- the Department of Labor and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- would be combined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister explained, the idea was to make sure that the Department responsible for employment and employment policiesheaded by  Mr Clyde  Cameron- would be more closely allied with the objectives and policies of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has explained and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has announced that although the present head of the Department of Labor,  Dr Sharp,  will remain as Secretary of the Department of Labor, he will be assisted now by  Mr Armstrong,  who was formerly the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those two will advise the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was amazed at the attitude taken by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this Government,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, whose sole concern after the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation was that some action should be taken to enable that union to regain its registration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the secretary of the union involved expresses his concern and criticises the Government’s policy, the only response which he is given by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is that he is a featherweight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have written to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, about this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  saying there is a danger of unemployment, and the Prime Minister saying there is no danger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a significant factor is the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake, the predominance of which goes to city areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware of the widespread concern expressed by migrant groups, Good Neighbour councils- particularly that in South Australia on the occasion of its 25th anniversaryand migrant welfare associations at the splitting up of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> target for the coming year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that some of the functions of the Department and of the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> would be taken over by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable senator, as  Mr Clyde  Cameron has already stated, that the expertise of officials of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will not be lost to the migrants or to the Public Service, and that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will still serve as an established centre of contact for all migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any migrant is unsure about which Department to approach with a problem, he still will be able to use the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the committee I spoke about on Thursday has made its determinations, instructions will be given as to which area concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will be served by the respective Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister also seen a report that certainly until 5 July Philips Industries was recruiting labour through the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also saw a reference- I think it was in the ‘National Times’ last Sunday- to the fact that Philips Industries as late as 5 July was recruiting labour through the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> give an assurance that widows now eligible for retraining under the present training scheme for widow pensioners will not be disadvantaged by the proposals in the Government’s retraining scheme which were detailed by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> yesterday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That scheme will be phased into the new scheme, which was announced by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, not before 1 October of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the comprehensive canvass of the position by  Senator Webster,  to reply adequately a statement would need to be made by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The papers and reports on the retraining scheme which was announced yesterday by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will be tabled today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The internal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy pursued by that country will determine whether an Australian will be admitted into that country as a resident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> say what progress is being made in solving the dispute between the Transport Workers Union and the Waterside Workers Federation which has held up delivery of 10,000 tons of steel from the roll-on roll-off terminal of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Port Adelaide since March of this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it a fact that when governmental announcements are made from time to time giving the number of unemployed persons in Australia, a rider is added indicating that the figure given is exclusive of school leavers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But with respect to the general scope of the question I can state that the policy of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Government in relation to the present target about which the honourable senator asked last week is to ensure that half of the target should consist of skilled people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I, as a Government senator, had evidence that there has been collusion between earlier <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> refers to the Government’s recently announced retraining scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which I address to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> also relates to the private industry retraining scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only undertake to have the matter examined not only by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but also by any other interested Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this is a question which concerns my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and if there is some further information I can obtain for the honourable senator I shall forward it to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, refers to the announced decision of the Commonwealth Government to introduce wage indexation by way of quarterly wage adjustments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think I could say that the policy referred to by the honourable senator is what might be called a platform policy which will be put before the Moore conference in the early part of next month with the idea of seeing whether the employers and the unions will accept what the Minster for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> calls, and the Government suggests should be, a package deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think I should be too precise because really it is the proposition of the Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which is to go before the conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in putting this package deal to the Moore conference the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Government intend to argue that if this system, were adopted if would minimise stoppages because, as the honourable senator is aware, at the present time a number of disputes occur because of the inflationary spiral. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> inform the Senate what are the precise issues that threaten to precipitate the strike tonight by members of the Transport Workers Union? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If before the Senate adjourns I am able to say anything which will not worsen the situation I will certainly ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to allow me to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will recall that I raised the question last week concerning the 10,000 tonnes of steel that is rusting on the wharf at Port Adelaide due to an argument between the Transport Workers Union and the Waterside Workers’ Federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since  Senator Jessop  asked me a question about this matter last week I have asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to give me whatever information he could about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conclusion of question time  I  will ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> the current position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the shortage of labour relates to the stevedoring industry, which comes within the portfolio of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has announced his scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will take the matter up with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and, if he can give me any further information, I will convey it to the honourable senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arrangement was made by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  with the Secretary of the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and I met the principals of the Australian Capital Territory Medical Association in his office in Canberra when he was Minister for Labor and we offered to go through with them in detail any of their industrial complaints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unable to see in the chamber at the moment the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, but we will soon be able to say of him a parody which was said of others almost 20 years ago, namely: ‘You will all be cool in Cameron’s pool’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was taken to a non-public area of the airport terminal by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Officer on duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was then agreed that he would stay in Australia and talk to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on Monday morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Monday  Mr Ermolenko  contacted Professor Kabalevsky at the Parmelia Hotel and arranged to see him at 1 1 o’clock after he had an interview with an official from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Grayden,  the Western Australian State Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has asked to be present and he will be most welcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole area of industrial agreements is so significant that it was included on the agenda of the tripartite industrial peace conference called by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in December last year to examine ways and means of achieving stability in industrial relations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is, I invite the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop),  who represents the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in this place, to give some attention to an aspect which has not been adverted to at all in the second reading speech explaining the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had a conversation with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by referring to a meeting which was eld in Perth yesterday afternoon by persons alleged to have an interest in the case of the Russian violinist,  Mr Ermolenko,  and which included  Mr Garland,  the Liberal Party member for Curtin, and  Mr Ian  Medcalf, representing the Liberal Party Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will comprise representatives of the Departments of Manufacturing Industry, Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and Urban and Regional Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of  Senator Bishop  in his role as Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sector MULVIHILL- My question, addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, is supplementary to one asked earlier by  Senator Poyser  about the operations of the Bally poker machine company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> put before the Moore Conference last week a proposition which, if it is accepted by the employers and the unions, either in the form in which it was proposed or in a modified form, will go a long way towards reducing industrial disputes in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, generally speaking, the aims of the Government in respect of amalgamations and agreements have become known not only through public discussions and announcements by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  but also in the proposed legislation to which I referred earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Has he seen reports of a circular letter from  Mr Jack  Egerton,  President  of the Brisbane Trades and Labour Council and State  President  of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he consult his colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> with a view to instituting a properly planned program of adult retraining at award wages? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> now has a special training subsidy for Aboriginal employees who wish to increase their skills or who seek trade occupations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in May 1973 when he introduced the previous Bill extending the temporary provisions for one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report has been presented to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Was the Minister aware of what was said by this young man during his interview on the Monday of that week with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he aware of statements attributed to the head of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Perth that, at that interview, the young man made clear that he wanted to remain in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, I think mainly through the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has been in close contact with various municipal bodies throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, such cases are not subsequently identifiable within the records maintained by either the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-82-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Departmental Heads to whom these arrangements apply are: The Secretary, Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>; the Secretary, Department of the Media; the Secretary, Department of the Northern Territory; and the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-82-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was asked yesterday whether he would table in this Parliament a record of an interview which  Mr Ermolenko  had with Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officials in Perth some 4 days prior to his departure from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Statements have been attributed to the head of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Perth that at that particular interview  Mr Ermolenko  indicated a desire to remain in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at that conference with the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> this young man said that he wanted to remain in this country and he indicated that he was prepared to take the steps to apply for permission to remain in this country, why did the Minister not inform the Parliament of that fact during the week we were asking him questions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the Monday morning he went to the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and he there had a conference which, on Press reports, lasted about an hour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding the conversation with  Mr Ermolenko  at the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Office- I do not remember being specifically asked about this- I now say, because it is no secret, that at that point Ermolenko said that he wanted to return home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said this once at the airport and once to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer next day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, with the co-operation of the Soviet Embassy, Georgi was interviewed a number of times and on successive days without any other Russian present- first, by the representative of the Foreign Affairs Department and the Chief <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Officer in Perth, then by  Mr Gilchrist,  the Head of the Legal Division of my Department whom I sent from Canberra expressly for the purpose, then by  Mr Cowles,  the representative of the Transport Workers Union,  Mr Bluck  of the Musicians Union and  Mr Michael  Edgley, the well-known West Australian businessman, who speaks Russian well, then by  Mr Tonkin,  the former Labor Premier of Western Australia, whom I had asked to intervene, and  Mr Harding  of the Federated Clerks Union and finally at length by a number of journalists on television yesterday evening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Monday morning he rang  Mr Goodwin,  the chief <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I make 2 points: Firstly, he acknowledged that at the interview with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officials,  Mr Ermolenko,  on the Monday morning, indicated that he wanted to remain in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also informed the public that, as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby  had established a community relations committee which had gathered a great deal of evidence indicating that discrimination continued to exist in important areas of community administration and activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, relates to unemployment in the areas chosen by the Government for initial assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently an examination is being undertaken by a Cabinet committee, in collaboration with two of our Caucus committees, to ascertain precisely what action should be taken in situations such as that to which  Senator Bessell  has referred; that is, whether in addition to the schemes now in operation and the one proposed by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> some more direct assistance might be given to people in industries which are affected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-56-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What were the countries of origin of the 176 persons who entered Australia illegally and who came within the ambit of the amnesty granted by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  and which was referred to in the Department’s News Release No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-56-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-56-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>48/74 issued by the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-56-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had from the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop)  a speech which one must say is infinitely more informative than the speech made by the responsible Minister, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in the lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In contradistinction to what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said in the House of Representatives, I must say that we had a prepared speech in the Senate from the PostmasterGeneral, but it is a speech which talks in generalities and does not deal in any way with specifics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one area in which I am quite sure that the Opposition Parties would be interested in meeting the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to see whether there cannot be some common ground to which expression can be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has used as one of his supporting points for the passage of this Bill the need to prevent inter-union competition in price rises and claims for wage increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The PostmasterGeneral  (Senator Bishop),  who represents the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in this place, knows that the classic case is that a person gets the idea and he gives an envelope to a person and says: ‘Are you voting yes or no?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said more than once and it ought to be said again that public statements were made before the last general election by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  that we considered these measures to be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has talked with the ACTU. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it may be best to get a considered reply from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admire and compliment the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator Bishop)  on his discretion in stating that he would get from the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> an appropriate reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice, of course, that in introducing this Bill into the House of Representatives the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> regarded it as a casual matter to be introduced with a few off the cuff remarks, and that is what Hansard discloses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether he has seen newspaper reports that a large number of migrants have been charged with obtaining motor car licences by illegal means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the migrants involved are all of Turkish and Lebanese origin, will the Minister take steps to ensure that the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> advises migrants of these nationalities in publications in their languages of the requirements of Australian law in relation to motor car licences? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the figures in the last report of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> led us quite clearly to realise that the unemployment situation is increasing and has, in fact, increased by 13,555 in August to 107,140. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difference between the attitude of the Opposition and the Government to employment is that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, has spent many hours devising emergency unemployment schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said last night that Australia’s greatest problem was a shortage of skilled labour and that if we could get 400 fitters and turners, an organisation such as the Broken Hill Pty Co.

    <p>I think it is worth while at this stage, in case there are some doubts as to what the problem is, to point out that it is adequately and fairly stated in the second reading of the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop),  as Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, where he points out that over the years, because we have this dichotomy in our industrial law, situations arose so that a State branch of a Federal union and a State union often were administered as if they were the same body, with one set of books, one register of members, one membership fee, one set of officers, one election of officers for both bodies and one system of meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was it not the Government which through the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  urged upon the country the proposition that the trade unions should bypass arbitration, go in for collective bargaining and yell for and obtain above-award wages? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said that he would not stay in the Government if it reached 3 per cent- and no doubt his resignation will be announced tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be an interesting test of the ethics and morality of this Government and of the collective operations of the Cabinet to see whether a Minister, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> no less, having said that he would not be prepared to associate with the Government if unemployment went beyond 3 per cent, will now announce his resignation when the current statistics show 3.2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware whether that company is in fact putting an embargo on the employees of Tulloch Ltd. All I can do is agree to ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to work with  Mr Charles  Jones and to get the inspectors to see to what extent those things are happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of the other schemes, and I think these are questions which involve the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, there is the RED scheme, which is the Regional Employment Development Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those funds are established through an ad hoc committee which is chaired by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Cameron)  and presently there are some 400 projects which have been approved for construction in that way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I should like to pay tribute to the officers of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for the evidence that they gave to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this is an area where there is an overlap between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, in dealing with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I, as someone who has had a connection with that Department, want to pay a tribute to the officers of the Department who through the years have served Australia particularly well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In paying my tribute to them I want to express my concern for them at the way in which they have been miserably let down by this Government which has agreed to the complete disappearance of the Department and has put in its place something quite incompetent, under the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  whom I can only describe, as far as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is concerned, as incompetent, disinterested and inept regarding the whole range of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I plead with the Government to take the element of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> away from  Mr Cameron  for good and for all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Cameron,  as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, came to the last 2 annual general meetings of the Good Neighbour Council in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop)  and the Committee: What is the future of the Good Neighbour Councils which, for the last onequarter of a century, have done so much for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best that  Mr Cameron  can do is to say nothing- not even pay lip service to the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  came to Adelaide to speak at the 25th anniversary of the Good Neighbour Council in South Australia he laid great emphasis on the fact that family reunion was to be the great cornerstone of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might be in London, they might be in the Department of Health or they might be in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heaven knows, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has on his hands now more than enough problems of his own making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For heaven’s sake give the area of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to a Minister who will care for it and for the people who belong to it, who are affected by it and who are suffering by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no communication between the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the State authorities and the people concerned with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the estimates for the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> are before the Committee tonight I take the opportunity of drawing the Government’s attention to the fact that there is a wide feeling of unrest, distrust and indeed almost grief at the way in which the migrant community in Australia has been treated by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is to happen to the work of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council which was set up by a Labor government many years ago and which, during the last one-quarter of a century, has been dealing successfully, I believe, with the integration of migrants into the total Australian community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise in defence of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in respect of what  Senator Davidson  has seen fit to accuse him of tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So for at least one year and 2 months the case about which  Senator Davidson  complains was the responsibility of a Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who was a member of the Government which  Senator Davidson  supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is because our Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is a South Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that  Senator Davidson  is opposed to this Government and he has to vent his spleen on a Minister who, in my opinion, has done a good job in the short time that he has been the Minister in charge of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must not forget the vindictive campaign that was conducted against the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby,  in the electorate of Riverina during the period leading up to the election held on 18 May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was quite prepared then to sit back and be silent when that criticism was levelled against the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been to citizenship ceremonies and I have never heard  Senator Davidson  or people like him criticise the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Grassby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these same people were not prepared to speak out in his defence when organisations such as the League of Rights were conducting a very vindictive campaign against him in the electorate of Riverina to bring about his defeat because of the humane policies that man was implementing while he was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it ill behoves  Senator Davidson  to stand up here tonight and criticise the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say only this: The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  responded very quickly to the need to send people to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think he was looking back at the time when he was  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council and when the general <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs were different from what they are present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government decided to amalgamate the Departments of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> it stated that there was a need to ensure that the workforce requirements were more directly geared to our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> targets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Cameron  was made the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> by Government decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I can only say to the honourable senator that the experience he has had in relation to our Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is perhaps the same as we had in relation to Ministers of other governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> institute early discussions with State <span class="highlight">immigration</span> ministers to ensure that in the case of Queensland we do not have a repetition of the conning of Canadian nurses as regards Australian recognition of their qualifications and, in the case of New South Wales, we seek an explanation of a repudiation by Jago the unready of his assurance to me 2 years ago that all New South Wales hospitals would have interpreter services? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> yesterday announced a number of approvals in respect of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741114_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have been told by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that he will be in New Zealand next week to attend the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, refers to the report in the Melbourne ‘Herald’ of yesterday afternoon that some 50,000 tertiary students may be unable to obtain employment during the Christmas vacation period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Bessell will know, because I have referred to them many times, the various schemes which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been able to get the Government to endorse to cover these situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have more than once recited the sort of attractions that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has had approved by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a matter which was well understood and recognised by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, as I explained earlier, when we came to office we became the first Government to establish a correct manpower policy and to gear <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to manpower policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making his report about yesterday’s meeting on the Regional Employment Development scheme,  Mr Clyde  Cameron pointed out that previously when areas had been declared eligible for participation in the scheme they have encompassed the entire employment office areas administered by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Does the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recall my asking him earlier this year whether he would compel people applying for unemployment assistance to produce a birth certificate for identification in order to overcome the problem of some people obtaining more than one unemployment benefit? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous question by  Senator Young  was sent to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Minister for Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Does the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recall a statement by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 18 August of this year that he thought most Government members would sooner resign than preside over unemployment of 250,000 people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and it refers to the answer given by the Minister yesterday to my question as to what precise advice the Government would give to the 230,000 school and college leavers looking for a job in the face of predicted chronic unemployment of the order of 300,000 to 400,000 people for at least the next 7 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the various schemes which the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has proposed and which the Government has endorsed are structural adjustment payments, the new location payments which have now been approved, and the Regional Employment Development scheme which is now in operation and, as was mentioned this morning,  Mr Clyde  Cameron has announced that an additional 90 applications for projects have been approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might even excite supporters of the Government to recall what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps this may herald the resignation of  Mr Cameron  as Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741121_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator’s question was, I think, generally alluded to by  Senator Carrick  last week at question time and asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to give consideration to the matter raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one case, a person successfully enrolled as ‘HBerrill (Surname) Stop Asian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Now’ (other names) and was a candidate in that name at the recent South Australian Senate election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J direct my question to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, relates to the salvaging of the bulk carrier MV ‘Sygna’ by a Japanese salvaging team under the direction of Captain Kintoku Yamada off Newcastle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Stop Asian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Now Party was another name that was used as a device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether, in view of the Government’s repeated expressions of confidence that trade unions would heed the call for wage restraint as a means of checking inflation, the Public Service pay rise is a clear indication that the real value of wages and salaries continues to fall as the rate of inflation climbs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been argued by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and the Government that, if wage indexation is accepted by the union movement and the employers and is supported by the Government, it will go a long way to easing many of the pressures that are currently being placed on the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to a recent Press report which stated that privileged people are applying for benefits under the National Employment and Training scheme to the detriment of more needy people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> refers to the address by the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr Cairns,  to the Canberra Press Club on 20 June 1974 and his response to the question ‘What would you like the WhitlamCairns years remembered for most? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only be guided by the fact that the figures given to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> by his Department- at the time people thought they were extravagant- seem to have been proved to be correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party has used its powers and its patronage in a host of areas, such as the way in which  Mr Clyde  Cameron, as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, dispenses 6 months previous average weekly earnings to some people who are put out of work, in the way in which it can be used through the Australian Assistance Plan - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that the use by this Labor Government of the power of patronage is well known in the area of activities of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>; it is known in the area of the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden);  and it is known in the area of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The position is that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> recommended to Cabinet the appointment of  Dr Wilenski  to the newly arranged department, which, as  Senator Davidson  well knows, is not now just the Department of Labor or the Department of Labour and National Service, as it used to be, but the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> whether Press reports are correct that the Australian Labor Party conference in Terrigal last week agreed to include in the Party’s platform a clause which in part states sympathetic consideration of people who for political and other reasons would face danger to life and liberty upon return to their country of origin’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More than 250 000 people have been unemployed for the last 2 months, yet  Mr Cameron  seems as disinterested in real policies which will prevent unemployment as he is unconcerned with honour, because he is still the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> presiding over increasing unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are trusting that the propositions that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and his Department have put forward will improve the economic position so much that in the second half of the year unemployment will drastically drop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think there have been any changes in policy but I will ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to examine the honourable senator’s question and give a more complete answer, if possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has said that first the Government has to consider it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications of the report will be considered also by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council and all I can do is refer to the Minister for his further consideration the comments of honourable senators who ask questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rise to support the Bill and to commend the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  on his understanding of the industrial situation today and also his ability to recognise what will happen in the future and to make allowances for future developments in the industrial situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not necessarily arguing that aspect, but the plain fact of the matter was that the union involved had to come to me and I had to go to the Minister to see whether appointments could be held up until in turn we went to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to get the granting of citizenship accelerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  rightly said, this situation is not satisfactory industrially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a change from an initial situation of government subservience to almost every union demand and encouragement by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of many of the demands and requests made by the union movement to a situation where virtually there is now the complete reverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the statement which the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop)  representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> made in an earlier debate on what the ACTU’s precise pledge to the Commission was, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  yesterday condemned the ACTU for the inadequacy of its approach on indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Bishop’s second reading speech, so different from the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the other place, attempted, and I recognise it, to give a reasoned exposition in support of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is because the trade union membership, the committee of management, the unions themselves and the stevedoring employers- certainly assisted by the officials of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- have been able to secure agreements which ought to run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time I did not have the information but later in the day, as honourable senators now know, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> made a statement to the effect that Georgi Ermolenko and his parents would be migrating to Australia and that they had been advised by Australian officials in Vienna that they could be eligible for assisted passages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although he may say that, as the AttorneyGeneral, he did not make the final decision but that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> did the plain fact is that he was an accessory in decisions that were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Any government, whether it be acting through its Attorney-General or its Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, if there are people so imbued with oldworld hatreds that they are prepared to create these incidents at embassies, must be able to withdraw or deny citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the first place, I am very surprised that  Senator Greenwood  has not followed the courtesy or formality of advising the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this place about the matter that he has raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator would like to reinforce his argument presented today by giving to me all the evidence he has, or states that  he  has, in his possession I certainly will take it up with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, have it checked out and later report the circumstances to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise again on a Bill on which one can speak to matters relevant or irrelevant to the purpose of the Bill and this again concerns the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and his treatment of an individual who is dependent upon the exercise of a ministerial discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committees were attended by specialised officers of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- not the Minister, I agree- who are experienced in the matters about which the honourable senator talks and who have had postings overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He wanted to use the case as a political manoeuvre against the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Some time ago an interdepartmental committee consistingI speak from recollection- of representatives of the Government’s adviser on community affairs, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Department of the Media, the Department of the Prime Minister and the Department of Urban and Regional Development was set up to consider this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They consciously surrendered a number of sovereign powers, including control of customs and excise duties and other functions of national significance including defence, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, currency and coinage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment has been made by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe I should ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to reply fully to the points made by  Senator Greenwood,  and I will do that straight away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only achievement that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  seems to have made is to put more and more people into his own Department and to have more officials administering these schemes which are costly and achieve virtually nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What interests me very greatly in this case and in the reported case of similar assistance being provided to the Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd of Burnie, but not of course in this account of expenditure that is before us for approval, is why such a thing should be occurring in the Department of Manufacturing Industry and not in the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or in some of the other areas in which structural adjustment and assistance of the unemployed would more properly be expected to occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government intend withdrawing  Mr Dragoja’s  passport by taking a similar action to that taken in the case of Srecko Rover, by a former Liberal Government Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, of course, under the administrative arrangements of the previous Government the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had a large internal information or publicity branch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicated quite clearly that the Government, the Ministers concerned, including the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Cameron,  consider that it is a matter for the Commission to determine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Postmaster-General as the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee submitted a report to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for the fiscal year 1973-74 covering its first 7 months of operation, and this was tabled in Parliament on 4 December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As further evidence of this, I would like to draw to the attention of honourable senators the fact that when the Bill was before the House of Representatives the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  accepted an amendment moved by the Opposition to include in the Australian Council for Union Training one member of Parliament appointed by the Prime Minister, another member appointed by the Leader of the Opposition and a member of the Council appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Council will be chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> or another officer of the Department appointed by the Minister, and it will be constituted by the Director of the Australian Trade Union Training College, 3 representatives of the Australian Council for Trade Unions, one representative from each of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations, one representatives each of the State Labor Councils and the 3 members I have referred to earlier in this speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authority will be responsible to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That subclause, which requires the annual report to include details of syllabuses and study undertaken at the college and state centres, was also inserted on the motion of the Opposition in the House of Representatives and accepted by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the same type of appropriation Bill as the Budget, under which can be raised such questions as why <span class="highlight">immigration</span> spending is not higher or why health spending is not higher and under which the matter of refugees and so on can be raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is at the request of  Mr Grassby,  who is, I suppose one could say, the unofficial Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The licences will be issued in the name of the Secretary of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-So far as I know, it will be organised by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in consultation with  Mr Grassby  ‘s office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think most of those matters would come within the responsibility of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As in all <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters, every case will have to be looked at individually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without committing my colleague on this matter, I think that if the students meet the normal criteria they will be treated as ordinary <span class="highlight">immigration</span> applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs had discussions with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on the subject of Vietnamese refugees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the nomenclature of the Australian Office of Information there is intended to be included within the one branch the Australian Information Service, the Australian Government Liaison Service and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Publicity Service which was previously a part of the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> but which, under the administrative arrangements of this Government, for better and more effective co-ordination of Government information efforts, has been transferred to my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told also that if  Senator Mulvihill  can supply further details to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> it would support any possible action to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will pass on that information to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-At present 135 journalists, I think, are employed in the Australian Information Service, including 27 who were transferred from the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over and above the establishment in the old Australian News and Information Bureau and the former <span class="highlight">immigration</span> publicity section within the Australian Information Service an additional 12 journalists, I think it is, have been appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> have said and I think it was  Senator James  McClelland who said yesterday- this applies to every Minister- that we are wedded to the principle of wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its inquiry the Committee took evidence from the Departments of Services and Property, Social Security, Labour (now the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>), Overseas Trade, Transport, Civil Aviation (now the Department of Transport) and the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Department of Social Security and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grassby was Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and he knows the approved intake, but as a protege of Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the National Secretary of an organisation called the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Restriction Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And obviously these people from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Restriction Council consider them relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1966 … the Liberal Government, with the blessing of the Labor Party modified the traditional selective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">immigration</span> doors which were so imprudently opened in 1966 have since been opened wider and wider to flood Australia with all sorts of unassimilable people who are not the types we locals were asked to admit in 1966. . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must persuade the Government to stop all <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or at least confine it to the traditional sources, that is, to people from the British Isles and Northern Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The brochure requests that a donation be sent to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Restriction Council to help stop multiracial <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that is most stringent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly I understand that the socialist republic of Russia has just as stringent an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia over recent years has adopted an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that has allowed the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into this country of blacks, whites, reds* yellows and browns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formerly these students were required to return to their countries of origin so that those countries would benefit from the education they had received, but in May 1973 the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> altered the regulations so that they could stay in Australia, thus robbing their own countries of their services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not decry the campaign against the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the first Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not disown the propaganda that sought to defeat a Minister because he was carrying out a humane and enlightened <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This information is circulated by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Restriction Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the almost 30 years since the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program began, no New Australian has been offered a Government appointment as senior as the Qantas post offered to Bayutti. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, for example, to the activities of the League of Rights in Victoria and elsewhere and to the activities of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association which I think forwards to most honourable senators a copy of its publication ‘Viewpoint’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Clyde  Cameron, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, made reference to this matter yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures which are available to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> regarding unemployment and those which are available to the Minister for Social Security regarding the number of recipients of unemployment benefit do not tally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> say what is the current number of people accommodated under this plan and what is the current monthly cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that originally there were discussions with the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to afford that particular industry and others in New Guinea the benefits of the experience in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I should ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to supply in detail some reaction to  Senator Mulvihills  question about the Bougainville dispute, and I will do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I am aware, the funding arrangements are being provided by either the Special Consultant on Community Relations section or the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Treasurer or the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  can estimate and require, in the case of the National Employment and Training Scheme, an amount of $5.7m under division 3 10, subdivision 4, of Supply Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to a recent statement of the Victorian Minister for Labour and Industry,  Mr Rafferty,  who said that the Australian Government’s national apprenticeship assistance scheme had been unsuccessful in creating employment opportunities for apprentices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the first settlers arrived this country has been peopled by successive waves of immigrants, largely from Europe but also from many other parts of the world, and now, quite apart from any future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that we may follow, we have a community which is multi-racial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a clause like clause 28 was passed into law, it is possible that we would find that people who are genuinely trying to debate perhaps our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy or other matters that they regard as being of importance, or even more abstruse subjects such as the inheritability of intelligence, might be held up by some as having a racist intent and of trying to divide the community when in fact that is not the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have naturalised about 1500 people in Albury, and our sister city of Wodonga has naturalised more than that number because the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> centre is in the Wodonga shire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That understanding of people from other countries was introduced in the first instance through the wonderful <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of the national Government, and both Labor and Liberal Party governments are due for credit in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was also represented at this meeting which was held to discuss this matter generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is another area within our Australian community in which I have had a particular interest, and this is the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has been a prominent and influential factor of Australian life for a long time but particularly so in the last 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, which was set up long years ago under the honourable Arthur Calwell, then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and in which in later years I was privileged to be involved for a while, through its many inquiries, committees, concern and deliberations has played a very notable part in developing the whole discipline of integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia over recent years has adopted an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that has allowed the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into this country of blacks, whites, reds, yellows and browns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By its policy of seeking deliberately through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to undermine the national character, the Government has succeeded in causing an understandable disquiet and what it calls ‘racism’- but what is merely legitimate criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last of these objectionable arguments to which I wish to refer is the document received from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Restriction Council which has accused us of merely following the Party line of seeking the migrant vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: ( 1 ), (2), (3) and (4) It is well known that ballots for office in trade unions have been the subject of activity by various groups seeking to gain control of the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-56-6">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think I have given figures in the past on behalf of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and yesterday I answered questions about areas which had recently been granted approval under the scheme which has been very beneficial in reducing unemployment on a regional basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As that information could only come from a spy network or from the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, which has the information given to it when they came into this country, co-operating with the Soviet authorities, will the Minister declare whether or not there has been this co-operation by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in his second reading speech, the activities outside trade union training- of trade union leaders and delegates meeting employers and management specialists on industrial relations discussions- will go on just the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this stage I cannot undertake to do other than to report to the Government and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  what  Senator Wright  has stated and ask them to consider the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question of permanent residence is essentially a matter for my colleague the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, with whom I can check this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I will check with the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and let the honourable senator know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> following the nonanswer given to  Senator Mulvihill  with regard to teachers in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the reason that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has not yet provided an answer to  Senator Mulvihill  that he has intruded into an area of State responsibility which was completely misunderstood by him before he made rash public statements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fortunately we have seas surrounding us and therefore the influx of people depends on our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are elements in that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy that are of concern to certain Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> investigate an industrial racket being perpetrated by Richard Bradford who operates a karate institute in Sydney? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the individuals concerned, Bung Soon and Peng Wah, sought an increase in their wages they were told that with the connivance of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> they would be deported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their employment was considered by the industrial relations section of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> which had no objection to their taking up employment with the school provided they were paid the New South Wales basic wage which was then approximately $68 per week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken up the matter with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and he is presently investigating it urgently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and relates to the Regional Employment Development scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter had come to my attention in May 1974 and, notwithstanding repeated requests to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  I had not been given an answer to the substantive inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter had originally arisen in July 1974 and, notwithstanding repeated requests again to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, no reply had been received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter concerned what I alleged to be and what on the material available was a fairly clear case of political discrimination by this Government, notwithstanding publicised boasts by the previous Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that no such discrimination had ever existed under the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop),  who represents the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in this chamber, stated that he would take up the matter with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, have it checked and later report the circumstances to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Greenwood  started somewhat logically by saying that the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, had not answered some questions about 2 persons whom he had been talking about for some months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I want to say about the first point he raised is that my colleague, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, has said that he is reluctant to give in the Parliament answers to  Senator Greenwood’s  questions because the 2 persons referred to have been the subject of inquiry by officers of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation who were appointed by  Senator Greenwood  in his capacity as Attorney-General but that he, the Minister, is prepared to show the files to  Senator Greenwood  and then if the honourable senator wants the matters answered in the Parliament he would be quite willing to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a view which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  have been echoing in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier this year in a debate in this chamber I repeated what the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, the then Treasurer, and more recently I think  Mr Hayden  had said, that the economic position would tend to improve during the second half of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not deny that there have been times when the illustrious Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, with all his ability to conciliate, has had differences with the Waterside Workers Federation, in the same way as previous Ministers have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Waterside Workers Federation is making whoopee under the encouragement that is it getting from men like  Senator Mulvihill, Mr Foster  and the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  as well as the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood has talked about the Foster report which was handed to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> has invited opinions and propositions from the Opposition as to what it thinks should be done to set up a new authority which no doubt must be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750605_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it expresses itself more in sorrow than in anger because, like the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland),  when we first saw this proposal for overcoming the problem we thought that this was an untidy way of doing this sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are hoping for some improvement following the change of Minister in the portfolio of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that occurred in such dramatic circumstances last Friday, but that is another point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ink was not dry upon that report before the company showed that without assistance it could not maintain the employment of its 4000 personnel and keep its operations going so that it could provide more than the limited employment that I have read from the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  was in Burnie a week or so ago, when he was Minister for Manufacturing Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This of course snow-balled and the private sector was forced to follow suit, even if it meant, as recognised by the ex-Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, that eventually there would be fewer jobs for even the unionists of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The justification given by the former Minister for Manufacturing Industry, now the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  for introducing this Bill is riddled with confession of Government ineptness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland),  who said this morning that when the Budget was being prepared there were signs of recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My friend  Mr Bert  James, the honourable member for Hunter who represents coal miners, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  and I had a singularly disagreeable experience today in speaking to representatives of the Miners Federation and other mining unions- unions which have given a lot of loyalty to this Government and to this Partyand telling them that we cannot at this stage do anything but support indexation of wages and incomes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any Baltic communist today, even in the highest ranks of the party, is still liable to deportation for opposing the gradual russionization of the three states by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of Russians and by labour direction policies which strew Baltic graduates and school-leavers over the vast spaces of Eurasia, where their languages and national consciousness are expected to die. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can well recall what happened one tremendous afternoon when the subject of the complexities of this matter came up and the  Chairman  of the committee,  Mr Bayutti,  issued an invitation that  Senator Davidson  immediately accepted that the committee should get the views of the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Michael  Mackellar, and no less a person than  Senator Young,  who is the Opposition spokesman on media matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to questions I have asked him recently concerning the new staffing and salary arrangements for the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission and to the fact that the Minister said he was discussing these matters with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> under some Government directive to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I now ask: Has the PostmasterGeneral had those discussions with the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As to the last part of his question, I have mentioned before to  Senator Durack  that more than once these properly constituted Commissions have said that they agree entirely with the Government’s wage indexation policies and with the guidelines which have been pronounced by  Senator James  McClelland and the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> been drawn to a Press statement appearing in the Melbourne  Sun  of 3 September that Victoria lost 128 300 man weeks or 2500 man years of production time last year through industrial accidents? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the claims that have been made by Ministers, Government speakers and most recently  Senator Bishop  in this debate, I would have thought that his colleague  Senator James  McClelland, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, had painted the grimmest possible picture of the economy and the problem which we are now facing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The serious state of the economy was very clearly pictured not only by the OECD report but was also outlined by  Senator James  McClelland, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, when he spoke on behalf of the Government in this debate some days ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I finally got some sort of an answer from him today although by no means a satisfactory one, because it is clear that under the Government’s guidelines, under the rules that are being laid down now through the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, very much closer attention should have been paid to the staffing levels that have been adopted by these Commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an exceptional instance in this industry of those wage pressures which are assisted by stevedores, aided by the Government industry authority and now abetted by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who was supposed to have tried to moderate this waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir MAGNUS CORMACK (Victoria) (9.3)- I asked the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  by way of interjection, which was highly disorderly, I suppose, whether he would indicate to the Senate the quantitative cost that is involved in this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I wish to point out to you,  Mr Chairman,  if I may be permitted to do so, is that we began the consideration of the Committee stage of this Bill with a total reluctance by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  to divulge any information to the Committee and that over the last 40 minutes we have managed to force him to disgorge information that he did not have in his skull when he introduced with great forsenic ability, rhetorical flourishes and all the court manners with which he is so used - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Can the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> indicate what he meant when he said in a Press release recently that sympathetic and speedy consideration’ would be given to claims by municipal councils who found themselves in difficulties because of the slowing down of the Regional Employment Development scheme which resulted in the cancellation of some projects? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: Why have I not had a reply about a  Mr Pavlovic  about whom I wrote, not to  Senator Willesee,  but to the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  on 18 July 1974 when he applied for a passport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What of all the others, whose names I will not mention now because I expect and hope that some response will be given by the Ministers of the Crown- the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  and the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee)-  to explain whether or not there is a vendetta against Croatian born Australians or an attitude which treats them as second class Australians who are not entitled to the rights which other Australians have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly, they will enjoy a honeymoon and they will say: ‘Yes, you were told by the previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that there would be 400 000 people out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those are not small matters and they are not matters that should have been dealt with by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the way in which he chose to use what should have been a responsible speech on a Bill which has been of great concern to the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I became aware of it because it was a boast of  Mr Grassby  as the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> that the Labor Government, unlike- as he said- previous Governments, had never withheld passports or citizenship on political grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second matter which I refer to is one which directly concerns  Senator James  McClelland as Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and relates to a gentleman named Milan Sogorovic who is currently in gaol in Western Australia and who, I understand, has been in gaol for a quite long period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The letter which I wrote on 24 July was directed, of course, to the present Minister,  Senator James  McClelland, and I received from the Minister’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> private secretary on 3 1 July an acknowledgment of my letter and a statement that  Senator James  McClelland had directed that his Department report to him as quickly as possible and that he would write to me immediately he had something definite to tell me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are arrogant in their display of the power of numbers in the Senate in what is I suggest, and as my colleague  Senator James  McClelland the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> suggested this morning, an unrepresentative House whilst they conveniently ignore the weight of numbers given to the Government in the House of Representatives by the people of Australia through the ballot box only 18 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the admission of the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  it will create in the coming 2 months some 200 000 more unemployed by its sheer failure to employ school and college leavers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question later spilled over into my portfolio of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>: Is it a fact that a Laotian student, Saysavath Vichidvongsa twice wrote to the Minister’s Department seeking political asylum for himself, his wife and his child? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a decision which the Minister is competent to make or is the Prime Minister the  de facto  Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the matter at this stage is not one in which I as a Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> am directly involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that the time of his permit to stay in Australia was extended by the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland),  despite the fact that the Opposition parties knew that he would not be here this week and he was here last week, despite the fact that they said he had all these illuminating observations to make to us and that he had the good oil which he was going to give to us, and despite the fact that members of the Opposition spent hours with  Mr Khemlani  and his solicitor,  Mr Khemlani  has not appeared before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> aware of the problems which have been caused, particularly in country areas, by the announcement of the termination of the living away from home allowance for apprentices under the National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth commenting on the fact that Professor Henderson did say in his report that steps have already been taken by some administrationsnotably the Department of Social Security and the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>- to disseminate literature and to advertise through the Press, radio and television in Australia in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Senator James McClelland)  related to the Sydney Trades and Labour Council within the last 2 months that if certain eventualities occurred it might be that that unemployment figure would reach one million. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fairness to the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  at the conclusion of my speech I will present 4 documents comprising a request from the Portuguese community in Sydney dealing with certain refugees from Timor, my submission to the Minister and her reply- the Minister will understand that I am not pre-empting what she may say after my remarks- and finally a letter from a former illustrious Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the person of the honourable Clyde Cameron which refers to a survey that was being made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to the question, I am able to state that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs announced that Australia would offer sanctuary to more IndoChinese refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mrs Constance  Mathers approached the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs with regard to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be responsible also for providing general supportive and welfare services to the refugees once they have arrived in Australia.The migrant services section of my Department will liaise with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and EthnicAffairs indeed with all other departments such as the Department of Education, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development- to enable any difficulties to be overcome with regard to the refugees on their arrival in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For argument’s sake, I would be curious to know under which item <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs would come, and I know that other honourable senators have other matters they would like elucidated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I replied to the statement of the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  on the migrant program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the chickens that came home to roost, particularly in the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, were attributable to the previous Liberal Government’s failure to undertake a scheme, in a manpower sense, of the magnitude of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last night I pointed out to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Senator Guilfoyle)  the fears and views of  Mr Clyde  Cameron, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who has referred to the increasing problem of political refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amnesty is another facet of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is emulating  Mr Grassby  and I do not quarrel with him about the amnesty system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I will undertake to have this matter investigated in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and have an answer for the honourable senator as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I took up the case with the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> only a few weeks before the election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first instance my speech is virtually a continuation of a plea which I made last week to  Senator Guilfoyle  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I have raised this matter again tonight is that this Government broke up the previous amalgamation between the then Departments of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply make an appeal to  Senator Greenwood-  it will have equal force, I know, to  Senator Guilfoyle  who is the Minister in this chamber representing the Minister for Immigrationon behalf of Manuel Sanhueza Eutierrez, a boilermaker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay a tribute to the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  McClelland, and to his predecessor,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, for what they did in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it lie with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations or does it lie with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, relates to a report in today’s newspapers that a  Mr Eddie  Zannaniri has applied to enter Australia to study at a university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that Australia is not about to encourage <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by terrorists of any kind and that  Mr Zannaniri  ‘s application will be subjected to the closest possible scrutiny? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only information I have about the story which was reported in the Press this morning is that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has received a final report from his Department on the application and he will make a decision about that application shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the more general comment with regard to encouragement or support for applications from people in that category that the honourable senator mentioned, I suggest that this would be a matter more properly dealt with by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs inform the Senate whether the Commonwealth Employment Service keeps any record of what proportion of the unemployed are migrants from non-English speaking countries and of how disadvantaged they are in seeking employment because of language difficulties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of previous difficulties of sporting teams, am I to assume that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is ready and willing to expedite citizenship for the team member involved? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, that the application would be expedited by his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest, therefore, that  Mr Nash  should contact the Regional Director of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He appealed against the decision and the Home Office did not say, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would say here: ‘You have to go’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Minister concerned took steps to have that officer removed from the staff of the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> because he was carrying out a task which was not in accordance with that Department’s functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As no firm decision was taken at the meeting in February 1976 between the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the New Zealand Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, it was agreed that there was insufficient evidence that the problems arising were of such dimension as to justify requiring the large number of citizens of both countries who travel across the Tasman Sea to obtain passports or other travel documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also agreed to continuing consultation on trans-Tasman travel and other aspects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which are of common interest to both countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister for Education ascertained whether the Government will carry out proposals which emanated from the Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Ministry under the Whitlam Government to create an authority to protect and enhance the status of interpreters and translators? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of a letter dated 4 April 1975 written by a former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to  Mr B.  J. O’Connor, the Director of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, in which the Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is he further aware that a similar guarantee was also given by the next Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  McClelland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister recently received the Northrop report, which was commissioned by the previous Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were cancelled on the authority of the Acting Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> on 5 February 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, that low figure would have been reached a lot sooner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second factor relating to population growth is <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 35 per cent of that growth was from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and 65 per cent from natural increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Directly and indirectly, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has been responsible for about 59 per cent of this nation’s growth since 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that the National Population Inquiry, which was commissioned by the previous LiberalCountry Party Government and conducted under the leadership of Professor Borrie, acknowledged in its report the positive nature of the contribution of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia’s economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After considering the costs and benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the committee’s final assessment was that the past benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> far outweighed the costs, especially in view of the role of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a supplement to the Australian work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee therefore concluded that Australia should continue its active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That recommendation from the Borrie committee can be further substantiated when other benefits of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> are considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against this must be acknowledged the burden the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has placed on Australia’s resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To achieve a balance we must estimate whether Australia can assimilate a further program of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in a social and economic context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the actual figure for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> probably will be closer to 50 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, Australia’s projected population in the year 2000 should be in the order of 17.5 million, based on both <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and natural trends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Borrie ‘s analysis thus has enormous significance because most current public and private enterprise planning is based on expectations of fertility and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> much higher than Borrie ‘s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will involve consideration of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, decentralisation and environmental policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, the population figure required for an effective work force is dependent on supplementation from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, then a plan to provide for the assessed desirable level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be formulated well in advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This lack of propensity for living in the country- reflected both in the lack of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of people to country areas and, moreover, in their movement to the cityperhaps reflects an ignorance of the fact that the country life is better or that the city is that bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had intended tonight to ventilate 3 cases of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> injustice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I was going to say has been fortified by a letter I received this afternoon from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In justifying the separation of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> from the Department of Labor, the Minister made the point that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as a single focal point would provide efficient methods of effectively handling various <span class="highlight">immigration</span> problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever might be our attitude to relating the wants of the Department of Labor to those of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the fact of the matter is that job security is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall seek leave later in my remarks to have incorporated in  Hansard  the letter written to me by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs which I refer to as document A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Document B is a letter written by me, in my capacity as the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, to the  Australian Financial Review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned a Spanish stonemason and pointed out that in October 1975 the then Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  McClelland being the Minister, had investigated the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is something wrong with an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program when it takes so long for such matters to be dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a person coming from Europe has passed his various <span class="highlight">immigration</span> tests then there must be some reason for this delay in the clearance of X-rays which have been sent to London for attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard Document A, which is a letter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs addressed to me; Document B, which deals with a letter sent to the  Australian Financial Review,  and Document C which is a letter sent by me to the New South Wales Regional Director of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, supported by a declaration from a Portuguese baker in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that  Senator James  McClelland when he was Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> agreed last year to reform the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, and appoint you as its  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new Government has since created a separate Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as a single focal point through which matters of interest to migrants can have prompt and effective attention and to assist the many migrant welfare organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will therefore not proceed with the reconstitution of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council as envisaged by  Senator McClelland  and as a consequence the position of  Chairman  is being abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of your personal interest in the welfare of migrants and I should like to express my appreciation of the constructive association you have had with the former <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council as its Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, I am afraid the new Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  oversimplifies the overseeing of an effective <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program when he uses such terminology as ‘demographic stagnation’ (Financial Review of January 20). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What might be termed the ‘<span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake pause undertaken by the Whitlam Government was accompanied by overdue innovations which the various ethnic communities had sought in vain from earlier Liberal Governments, namely pension portability, removal of racial clauses from the Crimes Act, liberalisation of income tax deductions for overseas dependents, and last, but not least, ethnic radio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He had advised the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  through my Department, earlier today that he would be seeking some clarification of the delay that had occurred in relation to these two cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the continued representations that we are making will clarify the situation and enable <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to proceed when all the requirements are met. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question which can be fielded by either the Minister representing the Attorney-General or the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to present a statement on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Honourable M. J. R. MacKellar, M.P., who read the statement in another place earlier this afternoon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Reference to the pronoun in the first person in the statement should be taken as relating to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to Australia has also declined dramatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the first report of the National Population Inquiry, page 302, if fertility stabilises at around 1975-76 at net reproduction rate = 1, the population to be expected by the end of the year 2001 would be 15.9 million in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and 1 7.6 million if net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> averaged 50 000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is currently running at well below 50 000 a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in the context of the need for long range perspectives on population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that the Liberal-Country Party Government, on the strong recommendation of the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Honourable P. R. Lynch, commissioned the National Population Inquiry in 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so far as Australia has had a population policy in the post-war period it has been in terms of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rather than policies designed specifically to increase births to achieve desirable population policy goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are people who suggest that Australians should be encouraged to have more children as a substitute for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, external <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will continue to be the only major instrument available to government to influence the level and composition of our population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that the rate of population growth in most of our traditional source countries for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is decreasing and, if current trends continue, will do so to a much greater degree from early in the next century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What population goals should <span class="highlight">immigration</span> be directed towards in the medium and long-term? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A precedent is the 2 per cent population growth rate policy following the Second World War and the introduction of annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agreed policy was that Australia’s population should increase by an average of 2 per cent per annum, approximately 1 per cent resulting from natural increase and the balance from <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One only has to consider that since 1945 some 3.3 million migrants have come to Australia and that one in 5 persons in this country is a migrant to appreciate the impact of post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost universally agreed that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been of enormous benefit to <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are a larger and more diverse nation than the one which set out on the large-scale post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are groups which see our standard of living increasing by upgrading the skills of our workforce and developing our natural resources without the assistance of further <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or even population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the community sees some cause for concern in an aging population, it may even be desirable to direct <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in such a way as deliberately to have a ..,—-6-, effect on the populationfor example by lowering the general age eligibility limits or by giving preference to younger applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our example and even massive <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from them will not have any significant effect on the scale of their problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For its part, the Government maintains the position stated in its election policy statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is an essential instrument of Australia’s population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those population policies are directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a commitment to population growth, with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as the prime factor in that growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, and I emphasise this, it is not a commitment to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> simply to add to our population without any assessment of the effects of doing so and what is needed to meet those effects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that Australia’s population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> strategies must not be a numbers game’ but must have a sound basis which takes account of the medium and longterm implications of various growth options. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs with responsibility for matters of population policy, I now announce initiatives which will assist the development of future population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is now actively engaged in the analysis of basic statistical data on fertility, mortality and migration and population developments and policies in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council (APIC) which was originally established in February 1975 has been reconstituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reconstituted Council will advise the Minister on such matters as: Regular monitoring of, and research into, population change; major developments and research in Australia and overseas concerning population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>; the longer-term implications of changing patterns of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes; ways in which future <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intakes can be planned to complement other policies; and implications of population change for various aspects of resource allocation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the new Council indicate the importance which the Government attaches to population policies and show its determination to base <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and programs on a range of considerations including the population objectives to be developed with the assistance of the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is proper when we consider the tremendous number of people who have been brought into the country under the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in the post-war years that governments responsible for such programs should accept a financial responsibility for housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in introducing this Bill in the other place showed a remarkable lack of understanding of the purpose behind the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is nonsense for the Government to imply, as did its spokesman for housing in the House of Representatives, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, that this problem of providing adequate housing for the poor in our society will be looked after by the current resurgence in the private housing sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood)  could get together and determine what their policy will be on the use, for instance, of places such as migrant hostels which are still standing and which are still operating in most States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question relates to ethnic radio and is directed to 2 Ministers, one representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and the other representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button suffered at the hands of  Mr MacKellar  when he was dismissed from the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the response not as satisfactory as hoped, due possibly to a misunderstanding by many of these people that they would be giving themselves up, and as many of them may fear coming into contact with authority such as the Public Service, in this case the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I ask: Will the Minister give serious consideration to adopting another approach by suggesting that they get in touch with the Good Neighbour Council, with all of its resources, where persons could explain and offer guidance in the migrants’ mother tongues regarding the Minister’s offer of amnesty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report on population policy which we received yesterday from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  also gives us food for thought in this regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> loss last year mentioned in the report and with the population declining at the rate set out in the report, one wonders whether in the 1980s there will be enough students to go to university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we were confronted with the turmoil in Cyprus, the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Honourable Clyde Cameron, faced up to a situation in Australia in which a number of Cypriots on holiday here, whose land in Cyprus had been overrun by Turkish invaders, found themselves in a very parlous position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A number of Portuguese nationals who previously were living in Mozambique and Angola and who are on tourist visas in Sydney and in Melbourne wish to be treated in the same way as the former Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Clyde Cameron, treated certain Cypriots when their country was in turmoil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is difficulty in getting specific information about the number of people who may be defined in the jargon of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as being under political duress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last but certainly not least, as I am sure  Senator Lajovic  will appreciate, earlier this year I wrote to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  about a matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put a twofold question to the Minister: How does she reconcile Liberal Party election statements that used such words as ‘unequivocal’ and ‘specific’ in stating that this service that the Minister administers would come under the umbrella of the portfolio of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our party policy with regard to a separate department for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs contains the concept that services for migrants would be embraced within that department also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight I seek amplification of a joint statement which emanated from Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, both Commonwealth and State, in regard to what I believe is an innovation which is to be implemented shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have produced a set of files from State <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers and they have other file numbers from our Commonwealth office in London. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put the matter directly to the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who in this chamber represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is my prime reason for raising this matter, although honourable senators may think that it is rather a minute aspect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned about the existing Commonwealth <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices not only in London but also- I suppose some of them would be temporaryin Manchester, Birmingham and, for that matter, Belfast and Dublin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She will recall that when the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  held a seminar one evening in Parliament House I raised this matter with his officers and they accepted the fact that the delay seems to be a running sore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  I want to respond briefly to the matters raised by  Senator Mulvihill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer firstly to the arrangements between the States and Commonwealth <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in summary, senator, the decision can be said to have both avoided a potentially confusing division of responsibility between Commonwealth and State <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities and to have extended to nominated British unassisted migrants counselling facilities in Britain and reception services in Australia which might not otherwise have been available to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the first part of the question, I am able to inform the honourable senator that the matters to which I referred last night on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs apply to all citizens of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland; but, I am sorry to say, they do not apply to citizens of the Republic of Ireland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the third matter, which concerned co-operation received by Federal members of Parliament who go to State <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices, I am assured that that cooperation will be given readily and that any facilitation that can be given by means of representations by Federal members will be welcomed by the State authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister be good enough to refer the case to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs with a view to seeing whether any such direction might be reviewed in the compassionate circumstances occurring? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this with all due respect to  Senator Guilfoyle  because State officers are seeking to put their paddle in the lake in relation to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She may care to acknowledge that following the confrontation which took place 2 years ago in this part of the world the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of doctors to the Australian Capital Territory has almost ceased and the medical manpower situation is a lot worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does research conducted by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs correlate with this conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several years ago, a survey was conducted under the aegis of the former <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, on the departure from Australia of former settlers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) The first Report of the National Population Inquiry and its subsequent research reports are the subject of continuing study by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council which has recently been reconstituted will be asked for its views on issues raised by the reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At its first meeting on 10 May, I asked the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council to proceed as a matter of urgency with the preparation of a Green Paper on population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies dealing, inter alia, with the implications of demographic trends for various areas of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the population projections in the National Population Inquiry Report are being used as a basis for policy formulation in a wide range of fields, including education, community development, aboriginal affairs, housing, social security and the environment as well as <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the migrant education function is now part of my responsibility, I am able to say that a special six weeks course for use with migrants in industry at the work site, preferably in employer time, was developed by the former Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> towards the end of 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter that I raise concerns the separation of the former Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> under the Labor Government into two separate departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the changeover of ministerial functions, the Department of Foreign Affairs became responsible for passport control and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has the function of interviewing tourists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the people who brought in the innovation of severing the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> from the Department of Labor felt that we would get quicker service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am now able to advise that the Victorian Education Department had approval from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethinic Affairs for the planned recruitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that a joint <span class="highlight">immigration</span>-labour team subsequently had discussions with the State departments of education and teacher industrial organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that earlier this year- I believe in January- the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> announced that we would offer sanctuary to some 800 Indo-Chinese refugees and that preference would be given to refugees closely related to people already living in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that  Mr Cameron  when Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, gave consideration to a proposal whereby the operations of the industry would be carried out by the Government, thus in effect nationalising the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has aggravated this situation by deciding at this very crucial point in our history to increase the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake over the next 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was under the guidance of the late Arthur Calwell, the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, who has been praised from all sides of politics, even by  Sir Robert  Menzies, because of his actions as Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was not going to bring up the question of migration tonight, but as it has been the subject of debate I feel I must comment on the quite incomprehensible decision of the Government at this stage to increase <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to a target of 70 000 persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard already from the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office in London that they are being plagued with inquiries from people who want to come to Australia because they have heard that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is going to be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last year as Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> I spent a lot of time and effort trying to convince unionists that not only was it against the interests of the nation but also against their own interests if they sought wage rises of such dimensions that they created a pressure on prices which ultimately had the effect of eroding their wage increases and making them illusory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another matter, which I need to have incorporated in  Hansard,  relates to the last statement which was made by  Mr MacKellar  about the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program for 1976-77.I want to link 2 paragraphs in this document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel sure that I could give an undertaking on behalf of the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs with regard to matters relating to political refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be said with regard to this matter that inquiries by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs have revealed that the direct transit facility has been abused by a number of Chileans to gain entry to Australia and to remain here illegally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also could be said that deportation orders against 7 Chileans, 2 of whom are in custody, have been signed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it would be understood that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy ensures that people admitted for settlement have fulfilled the necessary entry requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Is the Minister aware of a report in the Adelaide  Sunday Mail  of 21 March 1976 headed ‘Australia to push for more UK migrants’, which was attributed to a statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  I asked if a person were to be brought in from Ljubljana to Belgrade could there not be a set time slot for interrogation rather than that person having to wait all day after making a long trip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply convey it to the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761012_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister advise whether this is one of the 23 racist organisations referred to by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer this matter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to see what measures are being taken at present and what others may be introduced to minimise industrial accidents of this nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware of reports that suggest that Australia might accept up to 100 000 immigrants from Rhodesia following the Nationalist assumption of power in Rhodesia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to previous questions which I have asked him up to 6 weeks ago about the financing of ethnic radio in Australia and the joint statement issued on 14 October by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Bond  demands not only that these people be given special priority as refugees but also that the normal processing time through the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, which is stated to be 8 to 12 weeks, be speeded up to 2 1 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pleasing to note that the Government so far, or at least so far as can be gleaned by public statements on the matter by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  has resisted pressure on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all the reasons stated, and some others not stated, I trust and hope that the Government will rigorously maintain the policy which has so far been enunciated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you will be aware, following the changes of Government in South Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea last year, the previous Australian Government announced, through  Senator James  McClelland, Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, on 1 1 November 1975 - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  a question without notice seeking information on what the situation would be so far as Australia was concerned and asking for an assurance that any Thai student who felt endangered by the coup d’etat in Bangkok would not be forcibly repatriated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like a definitive statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on the Thai students who are already resident in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Baume  would be aware that the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  said that any Rhodesians intending to come here would be asked or vetted- to the degree that we can ensure security- as to whether they had aided or abetted any anti-monarchy attitudes within the Ian Smith Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such people have a legitimate right to seek <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are opposed to, and what  Senator Walsh  referred to, is mass <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by a number of people from a certain country who want to settle  en masse  in one corner of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had cause to place on notice some time ago several questions relating to Rhodesia and I want to refer to an answer given to me by  Senator Guilfoyle  on behalf of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the representative in this chamber of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar), Senator Guilfoyle  would know that there is a lot of interest in that area concerning Chilean refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter with which I concern myself is the administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having made those initial remarks, I draw to the attention of the Senate and particularly of the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Senator Cotton),  who is at the table, the delays that are taking place in the office of the Minister’s colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in making final replies to representations made to the Minister on behalf of constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does this Unit co-ordinate or liaise with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to relate my remarks completely to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently  Senator Guilfoyle,  in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  presented a list of statistics relating to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we severed <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs from the Department of Labor, taking into consideration the broad concept of fewer migrants coming to Australia we expected to have an ample work force to process things quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the other matter that I have hammered for a long while, and that is the capacity of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney to give citizenship applications a reasonably speedy processing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to give me an idea of whether, in view of staff ceilings, there is a 3 months delay in processing applications for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Mulvihill  raised several matters with regard to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the first of which was with regard to Australian protected persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will reply firstly to matters raised by  Senator Mulvihill  last week in relation to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, refers to the Vietnamese vessel which arrived in Darwin yesterday, Wednesday, 10 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The refugees are at present at the quarantine station in Darwin pending the decision of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as to their status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did hear that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was having discussions in regard to this matter this morning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The meeting that was held this morning of officials of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on this matter brings some further information to me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information is that the refugees are presently being interviewed in Darwin by officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be stressed that until the investigations by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs have been completed no precise information as to the future placement of these refugees can be given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Strictly speaking this is a matter which belongs to my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, and not to the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As mentioned in my letter of 1 9 October 1 976, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs would provide a separate answer to the aspects of the Rhodesian question which are their concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: Are reports accurate that the Minister has refused to permit the department to participate in the forthcoming Austcare and Australian Council for Overseas Aid Conference on the problems associated with Rhodesian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, variations in either fertility or <span class="highlight">immigration</span> rates could change the whole pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to ventilate to  Senator Guilfoyle,  the Minister for Social Security, a couple of matters that come within the province of  Mr MacKellar,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, whom she represents in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it will be appreciated by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, or at least by the Minister for Social Security, that  Mr Hutchinson  had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has a reference number in respect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> correspondence in which, I emphasise to the Minister, it is asserted that the United Nations- I take it that it would be the refugee commission- made an approach to this Government 6 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The New South Wales Association of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Reform took up his case and wrote to the Minister on 1 1 November, asking that permanent residency be granted to the professor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Primmer  also referred to the statement made in the House of Representatives on 13 October by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am able to give further information from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am able to state that there have been requests from groups of Thai students to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to be granted permanent residence in Australia prior to the completion of their studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs does make it clear that any claims by students to stay in Australia under the circumstances of which we have been talking would be considered on their merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no information with regard to financial assistance that may be required by the students under the circumstances about which we have been speaking, but I shall refer that matter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and obtain a response from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the general question of applications that are received y the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I can give the assurance that these will have a most sympathetic consideration and, I believe, an assurance that help will be given to the students who find themselves in those difficult circumstances that have been mentioned in the Senate tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I undertake to refer the matters raised in the honourable senator’s question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and assure him that I will attempt to obtain an early answer to the matters raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Now that the matter has been resolved and  Mr da  Silva is on a bond to be of good behaviour for one year, will the Minister accede to a request by  Mr da  Silva that he should leave Australia next Wednesday for Mozambique and not respond to a request from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that he should leave this Sunday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to his request because the demand by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs means that  Mr da  Silva would have to overstay at Mauritius for one week, thus endangering his personal safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators would know from the brochure distributed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  that until 30 November there was a transition period during which British citizens could obtain Australian citizenship within 12 months of coming to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we are unlikely to have any debate on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> before this session ends, can the Minister obtain from her colleague in the other place an undertaking that the recommendations will be examined and implemented and that the Minister will have tabled in this chamber and in the House of Representatives a statement concerning the progress made in implementing the recommendations contained in the report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to a decision of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, of which I was advised by letter dated 25 May 1976, that  Mr G.  O.

  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately  Mr Stewart  could not be interviewed and could not undertake the health and other formalities during a visit to Calcutta by an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer in late July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only available alternative is for him to wait for the next visit by an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer to Calcutta in the first week in February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s policy on <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs states that Australians should be encouraged to develop an understanding of the cultures, language and history of migrant source countries, that appropriate ethnic studies should be introduced into teacher training curricula and that ethnic communities should be consulted and supported in their own programs of ethnic education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the exercise of this discretionary power successive Ministers- Ministers of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> prior to the transfer of responsibility to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1975, and Ministers for Foreign Affairs since then- have followed the practice of requiring an applicant for a passport, if married, to obtain the consent of his or her spouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs follows a question which I raised in the Senate the other day concerning the very fine report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence,  Australia and the Refugee Problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The subject of deportation comes under the control of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  or if a claim for political asylum were made it would come under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770215_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can give no definite information with regard to the matters raised in that report but I am able to say that the whole of the function of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Social Security with regard to migrant services is to assist the integration of migrants and their settlement into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770216_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It concerns reports which reached Australia during the overseas visit of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, when he was alleged to have said that there would be a new 6-point plan to improve the position of Italian migrants to Australia and also that he was discussing a new social security arrangement with Italy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Press report of the statement of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs slightly misinterpreted the matter and gave the impression that there was a greater degree of conclusion about it than is actually the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He too was placed in the position of secretary of one of the departments of State, in his case serving as Secretary of the former Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> between March 1975 and December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 wish to make it quite clear that posts were instructed that a visa should not be issued to any person of this name without reference in the first instance to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This information was conveyed to the Commonwealth Police late on 22 February and on 23 February arrangements were made with the co-operation of the New South Wales Police for  Mr Teresa  to be located with a view to his being interviewed by officers of the Commonwealth Police and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has directed that the visa issued to  Mr Teresa  in San Francisco is to be cancelled and he is to be instructed to leave Australia immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Leader of the Government bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs the concern being expressed in north Queensland about an increasing number of citizens of Papua New Guinea illegally entering that area and staying on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs follows that asked earlier today by  Senator Mulvihill  about Vincent Teresa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have received information that at 2.45 p.m.  Mr Teresa  was being interviewed in Sydney by officers of the Commonwealth Police and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, follows on from yesterday’s question about the future of Vincent Teresa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer the honourable senator’s question to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and, if necessary, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to see what action was taken in conjunction with the New South Wales Police in dealing with this matter so expeditiously yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies will be implemented by the Government and not under threat from any union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Strictly speaking, the  Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs controls the issue or non-issue of visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to  Senator Guilfoyle  as Minister for Social Security and also in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister request her colleague to refer the question to his Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs for investigation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind the moral of the story is that we need closer liaison between the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that primarily <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was seen as a means of providing a source of semi-skilled and unskilled labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, that after 25 years of mass <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, one needs a magnifying glass if one is to find a migrant in the leadership of a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the higher levels of aspiration in relation to the son of work which people might be expected to do was encouraged in Australia by 20 years of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the first Green Paper dealing with <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population ever to be tabled in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia clearly enunciated its goal to achieve through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> an annual population growth of 1 per cent to supplement natural increase which was also expected to be about 1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established the goal, it set out to achieve it through a vigorously promoted, but selective, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not to say that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs during the past 3 decades have not been accompanied by problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless there is an increase in the birth rate, we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and, in the absence of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> gain, Australia will experience zero population growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the experience of several developed nations suggests that Australia could even be facing further falls in its birth rate and a future loss of population in the absence of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over recent years, we have also seen a rapid rundown in the rate of population growth through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents a growth rate for the financial year of less than 0.15 per cent through <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In considering the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> options open to Australia, we must bear in mind that Australians themselves are a mobile people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to avoid regular losses of such needed skills, it is imperative that Australia should maintain some level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> which is selective in regard to occupational skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This component of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program would also appear indispensable unless its underlying humanitarian objectives are to be jettisoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This element also, I believe, should be a necessary part of any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and I hope to announce soon the policy guidelines within which Australia’s future responses to such situations will be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Green Paper indicates, issues underlying <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cover a diverse range of topics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In terms of an annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, the Green Paper suggests that feasible limits might be net gain in the range of zero to 100 000 persons per year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High tribute is due to the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council which has prepared this Green Paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to pay particular tribute to the part played by the late J. F. Rich who died 2 days after the Green Paper was adopted by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now 30 years since the great post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was begun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program was introduced by a consensus of people of vision, people confident about the future of Australia, a growing Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no intention of placing any blame for the present situation, but I wish to state the position and to indicate, amongst other things, the total inseparability of the figures relaing to employment, education and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I start with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even now in a time of high unemployment the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  produced a list on 3 March 1977 containing over 120 occupations for which immigrants may enter Australia and obtain employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the total figure for net <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In periods of stability and prosperity we tend to have full employment and to increase our <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, but we also go through periods when we increase the school leaving age and reduce the age for retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It referred to the legislation which was passed by the Parliament last year- it was debated in the Senate in the middle of November- concerning collegiate voting and changes made in legislation on that subject which had been passed under the Labor Government when  Mr Cameron  was the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I mention that the subject matter of my question touches on the responsibilities of at least 3 Ministers, namely, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may have been some approaches and they may have gone to my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and refer to a report prepared by  Mr Dunn bf  the Legislative Research Service of the Parliament concerning Timorese refugees in Portugal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister indicate what action has been taken by Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities to contact Timorese refugees in Portugal who may wish to come to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, will an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office be established in Lisbon to handle applications from Timorese refugees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>242 on the notice paper  Senator Georges  calls for statistics relating to the current position of applications for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from East Timorese in Portugal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This information is being extracted by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in reply to the question and will be provided as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figure given by  Mr Dunn  concerning the proportion of refugees who are said to have relatives in Australia overstates the total as known to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer has been stationed in Portugal to handle processing of applications, including those from East Timorese evacuees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While obviously many aspects of the issue are dealt with by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  it nevertheless remains a foreign policy issue, an issue which will have an impact upon our relations with countries around the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I add that I think the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has shown an enlightened approach to the plight of IndoChinese refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They could involve a wide range of Commonwealth departments’ such as the Department of Overseas Trade, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Defence, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Primary Industry, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Science, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and Radio Australia and the Atomic Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that you have submitted  Mr Copelo  ‘s case to my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and since I received your letter, I have had my Department discuss  Mr Copelo  ‘s case with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know, decisions on entry and stay in Australia are the responsibility of my colleague, but my Depanment will naturally be making available to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs information which it holds on the situation in Uruguay, to assist in determining  Mr Copelo  ‘s case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct my question to  Senator Guilfoyle  in her capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figure given by  Mr Dunn  concerning the proportion of refugees who are said to have relatives in Australia overstates the total as known to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister explain how the information was presented to her because information supplied to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in December by the East Timorese Refugees Committee stated that there were 794 persons with relatives in Australia, which is approximately 50 per cent of the total number of refugees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister remind her adviser in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that the Senate expects accurate information in answer to questions asked in this chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer was given yesterday as a result of advice from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs which has at its disposal all facts relating to the people from East Timor who in some cases were seeking refuge in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the statement made today by the honourable senator is based on the information of  Mr Dunn  and whether it is claimed that it is more accurate than all the information held by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequent to those applications, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs decided that he would waive the occupational criteria for brothers and sisters of persons resident in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this continues <span class="highlight">immigration</span> may not let me return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is something of a pity, but it appears to me that our collective departments and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  have not taken the time to study the Committee’s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, they are requested to sign a statement allowing the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to provide the compiled list of names to the Indonesian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer stationed in Portugal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Refugee Resettlement Co-ordination Committees include representatives from Commonwealth Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, Education, Health and Employment and Industrial Relations; from State Departments of Health, Education and Welfare and the Depart.ments responsible for Ethnic Affairs; from voluntary organisations such as Red Cross, St Vincent de Paul, and Salvation Army, and from many other organisations including ethnic and religious associations and from refugee groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Upon arrival in Australia, customs and other reception formalities are co-ordinated by the Depanment of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs who also arrange movement of the refugees to migrant hostels or similar accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I look forward to, and am certainly willing to hear, discussion from honourable senators on anything that we are able to do in the Department of Social Security or in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs- the Department whose Minister I represent in the Senateto assist in the resettlement of these people whom we welcome to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>She was well known in the 1840s as the first exponent  of the functions of a good neighbour <span class="highlight">immigration</span> service for women who came to this country, some as ticket of leave prisoners and others as bonded servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and refers to the situation in East Timor, which has been raised already by  Senator Primmer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the specific questions that have been raised today be placed on notice so that definitive answers can be given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On one occasion I referred to a quotation from that letter to further my representations which are directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrew Peacock, and to the Honourable Michael MacKellar, Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that you have submitted  Mr Copelo  ‘s case to my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and since I received your letter, I have had my Department discuss  Mr Copelo  ‘s case with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you know, decisions on entry and stay in Australia are the responsibility of my colleague, but my Department will naturally be making available to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs information which it holds on the situation in Uruguay, to assist in determining  Mr Copelo  ‘s case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will give me a feedback. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 March 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs are not conducting any inquiries into  Mr Teresa’s  activities whilst he was in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-46-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the former Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, approved this practice in principle? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have raised certain questions on the position of Timorese refugees and the stance that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has been taking on their entry into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to be some determination on the part of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department to classify these people in terms of refugees and in terms of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> criteria will not be confined merely to what may be described as the close family relationship criteria which we use in respect of so many other migrants to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar)  is doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in 1 974 in which it was stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us will decry the efforts that were made by his Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  McClelland, in the last three or four desperate months of the Whitlam era to try to curb the abuse of the use by trade unions of political pretext in order to create demands for higher charges and dislocation in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They expressed the view that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  surely could not understand what the Chinese meant by family when he had made a limitation to what we understand perhaps in Australia as the nuclear family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second question concerned the signing of the letter which had been sent out from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before any Australian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> action can proceed in East Timor, it will be necessary for you to give your written agreement, in the form shown below, to details of your nominees being given to the Indonesian authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should it be possible to finalise arrangements for a visit by an Australian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Team to East Timor, the Indonesian authorities will arrange for the location of your nominees and their attendance at the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Processing Centre in Dili. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that the names and addresses of my nominees may be provided to the Indonesian authorities so that they may be located and assembled for Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> processing in East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them went so far as to suggest that we limit the signing of the form to relate to only those who would be assured of being accepted for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last concern which I had was that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has adopted the rather unusual practice of saying to people who are nominating refugees to come out, firstly, ‘Are you a Fretilin supporter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This figure had been derived from information received from the Migration Officer in Madrid who was then responsible for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> activities in Portugal, on the basis of actual applications received and from lists in Portuguese of what might be called “tentative” applications submitted from various sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-32">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought the department to which the honourable senator referred was the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An interdepartmental committee comprising representatives of the Department of Social Security, the Department of Education and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has been evaluating the need of this clearing house. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consideration should be given to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> of the people we need to generate more demand for Australian manufactured goods as well as to provide more employment within manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the thought, as much as anything else, of the massive unemployment which faced people in the manufacturing industry that led me to become an advocate of wage restraint when I became Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  will be presenting a Green Paper on refugee problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: Are overseas visitors or personnel arriving by direct flight at Pine Gap and other foreign bases in Australia exempted from customary <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, health or customs checks, or subjected to different <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, health or customs checks from other overseas visitors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, how can this fact be reconciled with the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that the same provisions and checks would apply? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter that I wish to raise on the adjournment tonight concerns an application for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> by a  Mr D’Leno. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took up the case on 9 January 1976 when I wrote to the current Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  requesting him to grant an entry visa to  Mr D  ‘Leno, Miss Thorton ‘s fiance, under the appropriate provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 24 April 1976 I wrote again to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  disputing the reasons given by  Mr Ellicott  in his undated letter received on 28 June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I request that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in this chamber, convey this complaint to the Minister with a request that it be speedily resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to ensure that the matter is resolved promptly and properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier in this sitting day  Senator Walsh  raised a matter concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give him the assurance of the Government that the matter will be referred to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for his urgent consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s Department made any survey of education needs in Australia during that period ahead, taking into account the findings of the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without taking away any particular government’s credit, I say that originally this was the brainchild of a former Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the other aspect of the present link between the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on the job assessment criteria for migrants could be improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Government felt that there was a separation between the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs it was considered that it would be all right if there were very effective co-ordinating links, but I do not think we have these links. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As late as this week I got a letter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  which indicated that an application could be successful where somebody is sponsoring a migrant to come to Australia on the basis of family reunion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am making is that I do not believe the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations is working as effectively as it could work in making joint decisions with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although  Senator Carrick  is not here he would appreciate that since this Government came to power I have been arguing for a continuation of the idea of the former Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to create an authority something like the Institute of Chartered Accountants to ensure adequate recognition of the proficiency of interpreters and translators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that this Government sort of backed and filled because originally  Senator Carrick  was going to be responsible for it, then I believe  Senator Guilfoyle  was to have it through Social Security and then later I believe there was a tug of war about the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs having it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter that I want to refer to deals with the question of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raised the matter with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  via  Senator Guilfoyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal now to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has advanced theories about the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake and certain categories in which it would appear there is a lack of certain skills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inflationary pressures, lower birth rates, reduced <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, changing patterns of consumption expenditure as incomes rise and industrial development of other countries in our region, have all contributed to a major change in outlook for manufacturing industry in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#debate-69">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Committee will: advise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on the capacity for accepting refugees, consult annually, and otherwise as necessary, with voluntary agencies regarding the numbers they would accept for resettlement, recommend co-ordination for arrival and immediate resettlement, regularly review the intake of refugees against the capacity of resources in this country to ensure successful resettlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided satisfactory sponsorship is available, a small number of such refugees could be accepted on a case by case basis by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Refugee Unit of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will be strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator MULVIHILL (New South Wales)by leave- Anybody who has read the Minister’s statement and related it to chapter 5 of the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> would realise the complexities involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that while we have people of such high calibre in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and other offices the Government will make reasonable decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) Are there <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program targets set each year on a country by country basis, or on a regional basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sums of money have been spent on migration advertising by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the countries referred to above. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) and (2) The annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program is not set on a country by country or a regional basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years the Government has followed the practice of announcing a total <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in respect of the ensuing financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Present <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy applies in a nondiscriminatory way to applicants who satisfy the entry criteria relating to family reunion, occupations in strong and continuing demand in Australia and refugee and other special cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-76-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to reports in a news sheet issued by the Indonesian Embassy in Canberra and reporting that Indonesia has agreed to an Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team visiting East Timor to contact East Timorese who may wish to be reunited with members of their family now living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware of a report in the Indonesian newspaper of 26 April 1977 concerning an agreement between Australia and Indonesia on visits by teams of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report accords with the parliamentary statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs which was made on 30 March this year that the Indonesian Government had agreed in principle to a visit to East Timor by a team of Australian officials to interview Timorese who are eligible for entry and who have been nominated by relatives in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to support that claim I should like to point out that a study carried out in September 1975 by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of unemployed juniors registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service showed that of juniors registered with the CES nearly half- 47 per cent- had not gone beyond third form secondary; two-thirds had not gone beyond fourth form; and in country areas 72.4 per cent of junior unemployed males had not gone beyond fourth form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we put those school retention figures together with the study conducted by the Department of Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> of unemployed juniors we can see that the unemployed school leavers with whom we are concerned are in general the products of the poorest state schools, they are the children who had the least opportunity at school and they are now the members of the work force with the least opportunity to secure employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This paper was prepared by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council, which was established by the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paper is titled ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  also has to be congratulated on his initiative in suggesting to the Council the general theme of the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, it has identified the major <span class="highlight">immigration</span> issues to be discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it has illustrated the relationship between the variables in the population equation and the linkage effects of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and general population policy decisions on the socioeconomic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter has achieved effectively the overall principal function of producing the paper- that of identifying and discussing the major issues to be considered in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and population inquiries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been substantially run down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, international crises are creating pressures on us to clarify our attitude on accepting refugees and on our total humanitarian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has attempted to tackle the task of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> with zeal and enthusiasm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It covers all aspects of the population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> issue, from background chapters covering such areas as goals and options, population growth rate trends and recent policy history, right through to a discussion of the effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the economy and the possible policy options. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to concentrate my discussion on the effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> on the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paper concentrates on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as an option in population policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as the report notes, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the population variable most readily controllable by government in seeking specific population goals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objectives of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> can be reduced to two: Firstly, those serving specific national interests such as providing needed manpower for industrial and economic development and more generally stimulating Australia’s economic growth; secondly, those of a humanitarian nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is a component of both these objectives, each motivated by quite separate and different considerations, is very important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an unfortunate fact that the socio-economic system imposes a finite limit on our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> absorptive capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This chapter convincingly supports the very real necessity for a consistent and sustained <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake if we are to ensure a healthy economy and a high standard of living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paper rejects criticism that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has had adverse effects on capital accumulation, economies of scale, technological progress, employment and economic stability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it deals with capital requirements, costs and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This area resolves to a discussion of 2 major assertions: Firstly, the question of the viability of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program in the light of the demands it makes on investment in infrastructure- social overhead capital- for instance, welfare, education, housing and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is little evidence that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is a major retarding influence on the growth of the capital-labour ratio in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paper suggests that in the short run <span class="highlight">immigration</span> may have a dampening effect on the rate of growth of productivity and thus real wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is perhaps the area of most discussion and debate in <span class="highlight">immigration</span> considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this area <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has supplemented areas of shortage of both skilled and unskilled labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question which is so often asked and which is dealt with quite adequately in the paper is this: Has <span class="highlight">immigration</span> increased pressures sustaining the high level of unemployment in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that the Green Paper rejected as insupportable claims that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has added to unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is a positive policy instrument in alleviating this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From all the arguments the fact comes clearly to light, that the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies adopted during the last few years have not Deen in the best interests of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That it is difficult to support claims that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has made an independent and continuing contribution to inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has clarified many fundamental misconceptions and unjustified fallacies about our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies especially to the effect on unemployment levels and real wage rates, a subject much exploited by unions both in voicing and in attempting to justify their opposition to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any assessment of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> this distinction is vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is vital also in considering the costs of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, especially in present times when these might appear uneconomical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it presents the option of cessation of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, as such, which is dismissed as totally unfeasible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister noted, the success of an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is dependent upon its being actively pursued and being based on a public consensus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During a great deal of this period when we have been accepting refugees into Australia our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program has been flowing at a very high level, so much so that in addition to those people to whom I have just referred we have spent a great deal of time and money seeking more migrants from what we have known as the migrant source countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population points out also that historically victims of many different circumstances have been called refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the statement which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has put out is interesting and welcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee will advise the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on a number of matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we will learn in a few days, if not tomorrow, that Austcare- the major nongovernment organisation in Australia for caring for refugees- is disappointed about this, especially in view of the conferences that were held between the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, his Department and the nongovernment organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Lajovic raised a very interesting issue with regard to future population policies in Australia, particularly as they affect <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies, which is a matter of great concern to all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about the working of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take this opportunity to raise a couple of matters dealing with the citizenship aspect of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting at the top, with the honourable member for Chifley,  Mr Armitage,  I have had informal talks with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  concerning some cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  will be interested to hear the honourable senator’s comments on this matter; the constructive suggestions he has made are very practical ones which should have our consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot canvass any changes in arrangements which would be the matter for a subsequent Budget, but I shall draw the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to the matters raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope there is some way in which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  or the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  can examine whether he is a desirable visitor to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked about this gentleman and the passport he possessed because when the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  was the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in a previous government, the New Zealand Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Colman,  came here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They conferred with people in Australia who were interested in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that our Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  should confer with the Minister responsible for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the Muldoon Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The action in the past few days with regard to the refusal of entry to two Croatian people was a decision taken by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs because he believed that on the information available to him it would not be in the interests of the Australian community for the people in question to visit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770603_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think it is fitting that we should commence this session with a perusal of this very important Green Paper entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population’, because I think that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> spells job opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this comment as I proceed: The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  probably knows of this dismemberment between the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and of a case ibr more emphasis on the secondary needs of migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> raises the question whether we should maintain a target of 5000 political refugees outside the normal categories of people entering Australia mainly as permanent migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of the unfortunate illness of my colleague, the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, Ted Innes, I had the job of submitting an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> paper to the Australian Labor Party National Conference in Perth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will probably study all our comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to congratulate the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for bringing down the Green Paper on <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have noted the success of the last 30 years whereby <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has greatly assisted the economic development of Australia and also its cultural development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is doubtful whether systems of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> such as the guest worker concept, which is used in countries like Germany, contribute very greatly and successfully to the development of their particular culture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact I noted from a Press statement from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on 6 August that last year migrants transferred $358m into Australia, which more than offsets the amount of $3 13m which was sent back overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, according to the statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on this matter, statistics in fact relate to people who at some time during the preceding 12 months experienced unemployment for as short a period as one week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770816_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I look across at  Senator Guilfoyle,  who represents the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I am reminded that although there is a multiplicity of nationalities in Wollongong, Rex Connor was not a man who asked the  Senator to  do his work for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be understood that under our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy of reunion of aged parents with their children in this country it is provided that the sponsor shall submit a written undertaking to be responsible for the full time maintenance of the nominee as a prerequisite to the issuing of a visa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This paper is the first Green Paper on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population that has been tabled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies for the last 30 years or so have developed essentially on the basis of agreement between both major political groupings in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This in itself is one indication of the success of the Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads me to query whether we believe <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be tailored to the needs of the economy or whether our economic programs should be tailored to the needs of people, including immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think previous conservative governments have seen <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as something akin to a tap which can be turned on or off in accordance with the prevailing economic climate in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore I think we must look very carefully at the statement of the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council that Australia has the capacity to absorb some 100,000 settlers annually. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the Green Paper is to be commended for a reasonable assessment of Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs and future trends in population, I think a number of questions should be posed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not posed either by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  or the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are some of the questions that should be posed in order to be totally realistic in assessing our population and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, as a country, have much to gain from investigating in full and searching detail our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> needs and our projected population growth for the last quarter of the 20th century and beyond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The new Ethnic Affairs Branch of the Depanment of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, staff for which is now being recruited from inside and outside the Commonwealth Public Service, will have responsibility, amongst other matters, for developing an overview of the position of migrants in the community in relation to health, welfare, housing, education, employment, communications, the law and other matters affecting their integration; identifying gaps in services or programs and, in co-operation with appropriate government and non-government agencies, developing approaches and pointing to action to remedy deficiencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-5">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to deal firstly with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the restrictions which are now placed on migrants coming to Australia and the refusal of this Government to re-admit migrants who have been admitted previously as residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are we so lacking in compassion in Australia that, even if there were a possibility of the son being unemployed and having to receive social service benefits, we cannot afford to give some assistance to a woman who is in a suicidal  state as a result of the action of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has asked me to write to you concerning alleged problems being experienced by elderly South Amercian migrants living in Sydney and, in particular, the comments of  Mr N.

    <p>Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy which is nondiscriminatory on grounds of race or nationality gives priority to the reunion of close family relatives with Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that anybody who is in any doubt as to his citizenship should ascertain the position from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, which administers the Australian Citizenship Act-not the Commonwealth Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the police subsequently interrogate these people and detain a small number for breaches of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I understand from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that on the night of 18 September officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, in co-operation with officers of the Commonwealth Police, visited the premises of the Tak Lee Club and the Fook Lee Club in Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand that the Acting Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police has reported on this matter and has stated that on 18 September officers of the Commonwealth Police and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in possession of search warrants under the Migration Act visited the clubs which I mentioned earlier and that 45 suspected prohibited immigrants were taken to Commonwealth Police headquarters, of whom 34 were released and 1 1 were lodged at the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> detention centre. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the suggestion about the sinking of boats which arrive under those circumstances, 1 will have that drawn to the attention of the Minister for Health, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, and the bodies which are undertaking this additional surveillance to see whether there is validity in the suggestion, bearing in mind our very strict laws on animal, plant and human quarantine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Associate Professor J. R. Wilson, of the University of Sydney, in 1970 undertook to carry out a costbenefit study of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  appointment was recommended by the then <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Planning Council and the project was subsequently placed under its general supervision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Successive Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> pressed to have the study completed as did I. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that I will, in expressing some regret about the apparent quality of the report, speak not only for myself and the Government but also for previous Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> who, like me, had hoped for a greater contribution to an understanding of the economic impact of the post-war <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program than this report offers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I journeyed to the Parliamentary Library to study a copy of the report on the cost-benefit study of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak with some interest in and some authority on this subject because I know that during the term of the previous Government the Minister then responsible for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, and the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> committee of the era, of which I was the  Chairman,  were very anxious to get something worthwhile out of this project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would rather say that, in view of the fact that there was a lot of controversy about this subject and there was perhaps a justifiable desire to get an effective assessment of the cost-benefit of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, it is a rather dismal document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I noticed that the Minister for Science  (Senator Webster),  who today in this chamber is representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar),  did give the impression that his counterpart in the other place was not in a position to say why there was such a delay in the presentation of the report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have held the view over the life of successive governments that the machinery in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations may not be sufficiently tooled up to enable one to try to assess the manpower demands in industry in the face of automation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 25 August 1977,  Senator Robertson  asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the following question, without notice: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A proposal for a member of the Timorese Committee for Permanent Residence to accompany the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> team to East Timor was received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As negotiations with the Indonesian authorities for the entry of an Australian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> team are proceeding the Committee’s proposal is not one which could be accepted because of the risk that the inclusion of persons other than officials might jeopardise further progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comment may be a reference to the Report of the Consultative Committee on Ethnic Broadcasting, which reported to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications in July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer the question that has now been raised to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to see what information is available at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking the example of this very important area in regard to migrants a step further, an announcement was then made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Honourable Michael MacKellar, on the establishment of a new body to boost translating and interpreting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Statistics provided by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  show that the various categories of people who will be admitted to this country comprise mainly people with training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I have been looking through my brief but I cannot find a poster which has been designed in co-operation with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Hindmarsh,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, as the Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> was the first Minister of recent years to do anything to try to redress the rapid diminution of apprentices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is in my own department a considerable degree of advertising and other means of communication of our programs but we will participate in this new program announced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Can the Minister representing the  Minister for  <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, in view of the continuous controversy in the media about adult migrant education, inform the Senate of the latest situation with respect to the supply and demand for adult migrant education services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  on behalf of  Mr MacKellar,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, will also introduce legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second aspect to which I refer relates to Australian Security Intelligence Organisation <span class="highlight">immigration</span> posts and liaison offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will go back through its records to the 1950s and pull out the files on everybody who has been denied citizenship and that it will write to those people in order to give them an opportunity for citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to believe that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, will go through every file and pull out the files on people who have been refused citizenship, that then some of these people will be given an opportunity to confront their accusers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask for leave to continue my remarks, confident that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> particularly will accelerate an investigation into some of these injustices which are on file and which are crying out for redress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- I wish to inform honourable senators on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  and myself of the Government’s decision today to allocate an additional $2.3m for migrant education programs for the remainder of the 1977-78 financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer that matter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to see whether he has some information that can be given to  Senator Sibraa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admittedly, I recall hearing  Mr Clyde  Cameron the other day get up and make a personal explanation that he did not resign as Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and take over the portfolio of Science and Consumer Affairs; he was sacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second case I mention, which I think is equally important, has some Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs overtones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether false information was given at the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> end or perhaps even at the passport section of the Department of Foreign Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is not the only body doing some work on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a provision would be completely in conflict with Australian policies, particularly the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies which are administered without discrimination as to race or colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Late in 1975 the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Senator James  Mcclelland, requested  Mr R.  M. Northrop Q.C.- as he then was- to report on the views of the parties to the industry as to what they saw as the problems associated with the existing arrangements and the action they considered appropriate for the Government to take as to future arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a later stage when we deal with the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs I intend to name a Sydney solicitor, but he is not the one named by the honourable member for Banks  (Mr Martin)  as being the man involved in one or two cases of misleading migrants into believing that they could get permanent residence when their grounds were extremely slender. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I direct a further question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information I have received from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is as follows:  Mr Adjei  did not claim to be a refugee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has recommended that further consideration be given to the introduction of a national identity card system which could also have advantages to other areas such as health and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Press statement released by the Minister states that other functions of the Committees will include:  to develop ongoing consultations with ethnic organisations and provide a focal point for all matters relating to ethnic broadcasting in the State; to advise the SBS on the extent to which the Broadcasting time available and the scope, standard and content of ethnic radio programs reflect the needs and interests of the ethnic communities concerned; and to keep the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, similarly informed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason we were included in the membership of that committee was that each of us in his time had been  chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was  chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council we did not exclude or discontinue membership to anybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that in the Press release of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  he gave the names and locations of the personnel of the New South Wales and Victorian Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not expect  Senator Carrick  to have the information with him but tomorrow when we deal with the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs I should like to find out what positions those people hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It deliberately appointed a representative from the Government and the Opposition to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When somebody from the Government made a statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> issues the Opposition representative would know how much it was coloured by party political allegiances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs aware of the recent attempt to disrupt the operation of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs through the sudden dumping by some clever Dicks in the Labor Party of an extremely large number of applications for citizenship upon that Department’s Melbourne office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that my colleague the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs received a report on 1 November this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has been informed that the reason given for not forwarding the applications to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs at an earlier date was that an action committee associated with the applications wanted the people concerned to be interviewed outside working hours in the areas in which they live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the citizenship ceremony held recently at Oakleigh is concerned, it has been reported to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that some disruption took place during the proceedings caused by three persons who later identified themselves as members of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to action to be taken, I remind the Senate that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs wrote to all parliamentarians in October this year, referring to the citizenship ceremonies and mentioning that such a ceremony is a formal legal process in which the whole community unites in welcoming new citizens to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the numbers of refugee immigrants coming into Australia, can the Minister advise whether refugees are accepted irrespective of health and other qualifications and whether it is considered that persons not eligible for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> under normal causes may endeavour to gain entry as refugees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact that refugees are being accepted into this country who may otherwise have been delayed in their applications for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or who in some cases may not be accepted as applicants for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am seeking to do so due to the late arrival of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> office in London was making one reference to a British migrant who was involved in a criminal activity and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  was saying something different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The next document concerns details from the Portuguese community about the failure to have adequate Portuguese translators at the office of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2 November 1 977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What action is being taken by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to facilitate the settlement of these migrants in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs whether the Government has considered the question of the nationality of the nearly 2000 Timorese in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>M. J. R. Mackellar, I am writing in reply to your letter of 16 January, 1977 addressed to the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on behalf of Miss Estrella De Mohaded of 1 /50 Wiley Street, Waverley, N.S.W., 2024, concerning the entry to Australia from Argentine of her sister, Miss Ana Maria Mohaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has a copy of the telegram which I shall call document C. In the telegram I drew the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>  (Mr MacKellar)  to the fact that if we were cutting corners in relation to the boat people as political refugees at least we could do the same for Latin American people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The document read as follows- text of telegram to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> minister Mackellar i 3.2.78 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Australian Government has some <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers in Latin America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the letters to which I have referred implies that an Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer was trying to reach this Argentinian penitentiary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ascertained from my last telephone call to the central office of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that in December the Argentinian Government said there was no such person as this girl in a gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry it has taken me so long to get these details to you but I wanted to cross-check some of the definitions of the various sorts of immigrants with Foreign Affairs and Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been told by Foreign Affairs that the list of names of individuals which was given to you by the delegation from the Committee for Solidarity are being processed through the Brisbane Office of theDepartment and Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only because I have not received a reply from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to my communication of 12 January that I raise the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She presented her documents, including the re-entry visa, to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought it was fairly normal that in most circumstances a person picked up even on a murder charge is entitled to make one phone call, but apparently a murder charge and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department at the Perth airport are two separate and entirely different things and the same courtesies do not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Stein’s  wife had to wait three days before her reentry visa was stamped, but his foot was hardly out of the door of the plane before officers were taking his passport and his visa off him to stamp and making sure that he was the first through the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it was at the direction of someone in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the officer responsible for the direction should be located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to respond briefly, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  on the matters that were raised by Senators Mulvihill and Coleman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs indicated to  Senator Mulvihill  in a letter of 1 February 1978 that he was prepared to authorise the Australian Embassy in Buenos Aires to issue a certificate to the appropriate authorities to the effect that, provided our officers were permitted to interview Miss Mohaded and she successfully completed entry requirements concerning health and character, a visa would be issued to enable her to travel to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I stated earlier, I will again refer the matter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and draw his attention to the way in which  Senator Mulvihill  presented this problem tonight to see if further action is possible by the Australian Ambassador or the Government to facilitate the processing of the application concerning the person who has been the subject of our discussion tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has said that we hide our heads in the sand, that there is a shortage of skilled workers, that these positions cannot be filled by Australians and that skilled replacements must be brought from overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and relates to the address given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to the Australian Retailers’ Association Council of Management which was reported in this morning’s  Sydney Morning Herald. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister’s statement made yesterday indicate an increase in the annual <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister’s emphasis on the future and not on, as he called it, obsession with the present’ suggest that the Government is planning a wider and more diverse <span class="highlight">immigration</span> selection? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have in front of me a copy of a report entitled  Population Report  1 which was produced in November 1977 by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  chairman  of that organisation is the Honourable Michael MacKellar, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know one applicant who is very worried, as is his daughter- who was a social worker in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs- whether, if their names were on this list, it has militated against them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is one such subject that I hope will be debated at length during this session, if only to overcome some of the popular myths which surround it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many myths in Australia about <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and several of them have been aired since this Parliament resumed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently  Dr Cass,  the shadow Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, aired certain myths about <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> should be cut to the bone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Government is certainly attempting to overcome current and projected shortages of skilled manpower, the avenue of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is only one of those that are to be followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy for an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program certainly is not based purely on such economic criteria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy is not as  Dr Cass  asserts, singularly devoted to the goal of economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has derived from its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I finish my remarks I would like to quote from a statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the use of a private plane to bring to Australia a person who had been refused a visa to enter the country be a breach of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and relates to the claim by the Premier of Queensland that he might travel to the Cook Islands to bring  Mr Brych  into Australia if the Federal Government does not agree to let him in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs contemplating reviewing his decision in this case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs about these reports, particularly in relation to the non-resident aspect and also the current reported concern about the already surplus number of doctors practising in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been advised by the Minister for Health that this matter has received some consideration with regard to not only reviewing the current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures but also taking into account in medical schools the possible oversupply of doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The eligibility of people to immigrate under the current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy should not be confused with the eligibility to practise, which is the matter which I referred to as being the responsibility of State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of a clerical error the Press release in question was prepared on headed paper normally used for announcements made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he can arrange for the Government  members’  committee on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and employment and industrial relations to co-ordinate with this body to overcome the present impasse where employers who want tyre builders are rejecting a National Employment and Training scheme retraining concept and are suggesting an intake of overseas tyre builders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister will agree that in effect this is really a litmus test of a successful <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator referred to a government committee on employment and industrial relations and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will raise the question of bringing in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and relates to the question asked yesterday by  Senator Young  concerning the extraordinary situation in South Australia where in the past two years some 1 ,200 overseas doctors have registered to practise although they do not live in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the position as far as the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increased public awareness of drug-running breaches, and breaches of fisheries, quarantine, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and other Australian laws has heightened the need for an examination of offshore law enforcement methods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Executive has initiated moves for a joint Northern Territory-Queensland-Western Australian approach to impress on Canberra the seriousness of drug smuggling and illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the north. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Migration Act, which is administered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, is also applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People regard fishing, illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, drug running and introduction of unwanted disease as representing a defence function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An Australian coastguard should be set up now, equipped with Australianmade patrol boats and medium range aircraft to perform the essential civil task of protecting Australian fishing and marine mineral resources and enforcing Australian customs, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, transport and health laws in Territorial waters and within the proposed extended economic zone? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will we have to protect the resources in that area; we will have to perform the health and quarantine functions, prevent the illegal importation of drugs and other goods and prevent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to assume, on the basis of Press reports, that the impending discussions between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will be restricted solely to Vietnamese refugees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that the discussions wtih the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his officials are not confined to the Vietnamese but cover a review of refugee-type situations throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-On 2 1 February this year the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  wrote to  Mr Mu  Pingue Fongue, the Secretary of the Timorese Committee for Permanent Residence in Australia, in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been in that situation for some two years now, and because of what seems to me to be bureaucratic indifference in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, nothing has been done to expedite the bringing of one or both of his parents to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that has done has been to raise new sets of hopes, somewhat cynical I suppose, in view of the fact that this matter was first mooted by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as early as March 1977, and that nothing has happened since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by referring the Senate to the report of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid of August 1977 entitled ‘A Response to a Green Paper- <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policies and Australia’s Population’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matters which they raised very strongly relate to the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team which we hope will soon go to Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was promised that we would have an opportunity to send people from our Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to Timor to investigate those who want to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that it will require that photographs be taken to ensure that the people actually interviewed are the people the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team wants to interview. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when the governments of the two countries reach agreement that an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team should go there, we should ensure that such a team does not cause greater danger to the people there but that it interviews people who desire to come to this country and whom we desire to come to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the standards laid down by our Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs for allowing these refugees to come from Portugal to Australia are altogether too strict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘families’ should be widely interpreted in the terms of the culture and background of the refugees concerned rather than according to the normal criteria of Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> procedures- this would involve the acceptance, appropriate to each particular ethnic group, of degrees of what we might describe as extended families ‘; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our responsibility as I see it is, firstly, urgent and effective pressure from Australia for the acceptance by Indonesia of an Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team in Timor and the achievement of early reunion of families from there; secondly, for a more compassionate re-examination of the Portugal refugee program and the bringing from Portugal of many more of the people who are there at the moment and who want to come to Australia; thirdly, pressure for International Red Cross to get back into Timor and also for us to supply aid to these families in Timor; and lastly, support for the Timorese leadership financially in Australia in the way that has been referred to by both  Senator Button  and me so that we will help the people who are here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some information on this matter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  and later  Senator Missen  mentioned that in March 1977 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs announced that following discussions in Jakarta the Indonesian Government agreed in principle to a visit to East Timor by a team of Australian officials to interview Timorese refugees who were eligible for entry and who were nominated by relatives in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until now it has not been possible, despite the statement in March 1977 of our Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, to take any action regarding the nominations submitted by close relatives of Timorese in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Indonesian Government has advised that arrangements for a visit to East Timor by a Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> team will be discussed after the elections this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will draw the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to the comments made by the honourable senator and I shall obtain a response from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply summarise by saying that I feel sure that the case of the East Timorese refugees that has been presented to the Senate will receive the urgent and active attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 30 December 1977 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal delivered its decision on an application by  Mr Alvaro  Salazar-Arbelaez for review of a decision of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to deport him from Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cavanagh asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs the following question, without notice, on 2 March 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Would the use of a private plane to bring to Australia a person who had been refused a visa to enter the country be in breach of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If, however, the person brought to Australia sought to evade <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls, and the person bringing him here was a party to such attempted evasion, this would be unlawful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Peter Baume asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs the following question, without notice, on 7 March 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on a Press release of last week wherein the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs stated that, after consultation with the United Nations Refugee Commissioner, he had created an interdepartmental committee to consider the political refugee status of people entering Australia obviously on tourist visas and of those who present themselves at Australian ports for the same privileges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coupled with an earlier assurance about the unique situation besetting Latin American nationals, I ask the Minister: In addition to the statement, what has been done to meet the situation that is confronting the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs now in respect of Latin Americans in gaols who are offered exile to another country but are not recognised at the moment by the Minister as genuine political refugee applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When making the original statement the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had in mind that he would arrange for any cases referred to him by the Latin American community to be examined as quickly as circumstances would permit and that he would give them compassionate consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that could be arranged directly between the senator and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Department confirms that the interpreter was not an employee of the Department and a check with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs reveals that he was not an employee of the Telephone Interpreter Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that the Indonesian Government has agreed, following the presidential election, that an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> team should go to East Timor to obtain the reunification of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March 1977 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  promised that a team would visit East Timor directly within six months to look at the whole question and he said further that negotiations were in process with the Indonesian authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence, there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the Department of Productivity and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did a party of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials go to Thailand to discourage refugees from coming illegally to Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case, I ask the Minister- and this is the third occasion on which I have raised this matter: When will we get some rationalisation or consistency of policy between the ministries of Productivity, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and  Mr Street’s  Department to resolve the impasse with the rubber manufacturers as to whether we fill the gaps with tyre builders who have been through a mini National Employment and Training scheme or, as the multi-nationals imply, by recruitment from overseas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, visas are issued by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Might I emphasise that I refuse to accept the direct imposition of people on the Australian Government without your own Ministerial evaluation, but on that basis I have yet to see flexibility in Latin American applicants suffering political duress approach anything like the incessant stream of boat people who claim to be escaping from a Left Wing Asian Government and in that context I enclose Appendix ‘B’ which shows that the girl in question must have encountered some very naive Australian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Officer when interviewed as my stock question to such people would have been how much money had they made from blackmarket operations and been taxed on such money to rehabilitate their war-devastated homeland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised that it may turn out that the Council on Interpreting and Translating, established by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, will recommend that the College should move into some other field of interpreting and translating where there is scope for a single national course rather than provide facilities in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s questions: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to 12 official Greek interpreters- five from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and seven from the New South Wales Premiers Department’s interpreting panel- were made available from time to time as well as three Greek speaking members of the Commonwealth Police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 20 September 1977 I asked  Senator Guilfoyle  a question concerning the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethic Affairs and referred to the actions which that Department through the Commonwealth Police had taken against certain Chinese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the police subsequently interrogate these people and detain a small number for breaches of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Department of Social Security, or for that matter the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs too, is allowed to continue operating as it is operating at present and if the Commonwealth Police continue to act in this massive way whether against Croatians, Chinese, Fijians, Australians of Anglo-Saxon origin or any other ethnic group, curbs ought to be placed upon them by this Parliament and the purpose of this debate is to ensure that such an operation is never allowed to occur again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst many people have considerable sympathy for migrants and, particularly, refugees coming to Australia, such as those from Timor and Vietnam, they are becoming increasingly alarmed at the continuous flow of foreign boats landing at Darwin or on the northern coast and escaping the scrutiny of our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and quarantine officials until they are close to shore or have actually made a landfall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As these people are now deliberately by-passing <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials based in South East Asia, will the Government consider setting up a quarantine area, say on an off-shore northern island, to carry out full investigations as to quarantine and their backgrounds in an effort to safeguard Australia for the reasons I have outlined? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that  Senator Missen  will be happy when I say that there is nothing racial in what I have to state in relation to large numbers of Japanese coming in to work this project, when our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy has been seriously restrictive and when we have such a high unemployment content in the local population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will close on that note and make this final plea to the Government: That it take the initiative, under the legislation that is available to it, to ensure that before the project is proceeded with every possible safeguard in terms of the environment, foreign investment, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, and any other aspect that is to the benefit of Australia is properly investigated and safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780504_senate_31_s77/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the concern expressed by the Government at the number of Vietnamese refugees coming by boat to Darwin and the Government’s attempt to stop these unheralded arrivals by sending additional <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers to Indo-China, I ask: Is there any truth in the claim that following the previous Government’s ratification of the 1967 extensions to the United Nations Convention on Refugees, Australia is now obliged to accept all refugees regardless of number without any restriction on their entry due to a criminal record, political activity or health? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780505_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs seen a report that the United States Administration estimates that more than 3,000 boat people arrived in Australia last month? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, is based upon information that was furnished to Estimates Committee C on Friday, at which she was present, and at which her officers disclosed that the ratio of Vietnamese political refugees to Latin Americans was running as high as six to one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I shall refer the matter to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to see whether there is any further information he can give about Latin Americans who seek entry into Australia and whether at this stage there are any other matters upon which he would like to advise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and/or the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and refers to the proposals put up by the Australian Government to Indonesia in respect of reuniting East Timorese families following the occupation of that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: What action has the Government taken on recommendation 25 of the report, tabled in June 1977, of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, on its Middle East reference, which urged the Government to avoid transferring foreign quarrels to Australia by taking more stringent steps to deny entry to people who had participated in, or had called for, acts of terrorism abroad? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs stems from revelations at the Estimates Committee hearings that our intake of Vietnamese refugees is in the ratio of six to one compared with those from Latin America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the happenings in Lima, Peru, at the weekend, and the concern of the Sydney Peruvian community as to what the future holds for people under political duress in that country, can the Minister express a view as to the continuance of a high ratio of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from one area as opposed to another? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In relation to the Protected Zone provisions permitting freedom of movement by the local people in the carrying on of traditional activities, the treaty will provide for cooperation on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, customs, health and quarantine arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the Protected Zone provisions which will permit the continued performance of traditional activities by the local peoples and continued freedom of movement about the Zone for that purpose, there will be cooperation on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, customs, health and quarantine arrangements, although each country will retain the right to implement national controls to prevent abuses or other possible adverse effects of the Protected Zone provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the protected zone provisions of the treaty will permit freedom of movement by the local people within the protected zone, but at the same time the treaty will provide for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, customs, health and quarantine arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that over recent months, culminating in discussions during the Estimates committee hearings concerning the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I have made the point that our intake of political refugees should have a more balanced ratio. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has argued that as some Latin Americans from countries with extreme political oppression are not in a third country it would be very difficult to process them and define them as being within the ambit of political refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> figures would prove that our intake of Latin American people consists of people who have been victims of governments on the far right and, in some cases, on the far left and who have fitted in very well and met their responsibilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Department of Health and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs are very concerned to see that any risk of reintroducing a disease of this kind is minimised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the consequential advantages of this legislation may be the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia of people of wealth and all the benefits which their wealth would bring to this country if it were invested here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only a handful of issues has, in the last few months, attracted more persistent speculation than the prospect of a revised <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The issue between us has never been the fact of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> but the quantum and nature of intake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since 1 974, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies have been very tightly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>While there has been a shortage of hard data on which to reach firm conclusions regarding the economic effects of population growth and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, many have seen a link between post-war economic development and large-scale <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even statisticians cannot succeed in projecting human fertility or, in fact, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could take the matter a little further and refer to a very competent officer in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a Press statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  dated 2 June, in which it is stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Announcing this today, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs was concerned to see that the Northern Territory Good Neighbour Council was being disbanded because he said in a telegram of consolationalmost of condolence- to the Northern Territory Good Neighbour Council: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a big job to do outside the Darwin area and the migrant resource centre proposed by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affiairs following the Galbally report would not be able to do this job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have made the point that the migrants accept their value, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs accepts their value and I am sure honourable senators would all see the value of avoiding the creation of a problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representations were made to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on behalf of Bozo Dubajic alias Ronald Orbinski, while he was being held in custody following his arrest on 19 May 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Baird  was given the names and telephone numbers of officials in the US <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Service in Los Angeles and was advised to call the Consul-General again should he require further assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the question asked by the honourable senator raises a wider issue of policy with specific reference to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs favoured the importation of tyre builders from Uruquay and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations favoured an employer such as Firestone Australia Pty Ltd upgrading employees, and there was an impasse between the two departments, would such a matter concerning a major component of Government manpower policy go to Cabinet for a final decision? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Labor Party was in government I was able to persuade the then Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Cameron,  to open a Commonwealth Employment Service regional office in Murray Bridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One illustration of this point is that the Government runs its current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> intake program on the basis of skills categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every month or every few months the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  puts out a list of skills categories under which persons wishing to migrate to Australia can qualify as being eligible for <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government can identify those areas of needed skills for the purpose of its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program, surely it could identify them for the purpose of establishing a proper work force training program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, even a year after the Labor Party came to power- that is, in 1974- the CES offices did not have much to cope with because at that stage the Labor Minister for Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> said that we had ‘overemployment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I charge the Government with this worsening unemployment position as a result of its utter failure to implement adequate retraining policies and adequate manpower policies and its utter failure to implement adequate <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the employment section I cannot see spelled out any means of getting advice from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs about how many people are in the pipeline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in this sort of case that there is a failure to mesh employment and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to hammer the point that the employment service is responsible for job placement but unless there is a better meshing with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that is the sort of situation that can arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that criticism and I ask the Minister to tell me how we can achieve this link with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that at the moment there are co-ordinating committees in the capital cities that evaluate demand, but in the case I have instanced, because the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> money ran out in early June, there has been a time lag on trade tests in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I then wrote to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  about the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon I received a phone call from the woman saying that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs had said that the South Korean mechanic they had employed had to leave next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We eulogise the capacity of the employment service to find jobs for people, and I go along with 90 per cent of what is said, but if we want to create the perfect manpower system and if eight employment offices have said that nobody is offering, how is it that the message does not get through to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and his people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the Minister to indicate to me ways in which there could be a link with the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can either blame the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or say that bad judgment on the part of the CES office was the cause because it did not suggest it had anyone suitable on its books. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister where is the liaison between the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who is at the table, knows, the theme of my discourse is the need for an evenhanded approach to extending clemency in respect of certain <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently, I took a delegation from the Latin American community to see the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen a letter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs which points out, loud and clear, that a false statement had been made by this man to gain exist from Beirut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has made his point to warn people against making false statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had knowledge that  Senator Mulvihill  wished to raise this matter this evening and I have been advised by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in regard to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am-led to understand by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that  Mr Moussa  ‘s application for the entry of his family has been refused because of the deception he practised in gaining entry to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It attempted to advise on potential bottlenecks as well as possible soft spots in the labour markets so these weaknesses could be overcome through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and retraining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a very fine Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in the person of Clyde Cameron who was a great innovater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this Government came to office it created a separate portfolio of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs from Employment and Industrial Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I respectfully believe that as  Mr Street’s  work load is such that he does not have to handle <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters directly, some matters relating to productivity or even some aspects of industrial safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to the announcement made by the Acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ellicott,  on 27 July 1978 that the Indonesian and Australian governments had made arrangements for the reunion of Timorese families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs that the agreement reached in Jakarta during the talks between Australian and Indonesian officials provided for an exchange of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> teams to reunite families in either Australia or Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Information on the movement, and residence without proper authority of Papua New Guineans in the Torres Strait area and mainland Australia has been obtained by a task force from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, in the course of visits to the area in recent months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not aware ofthe number of residents of Papua New Guinea who have been engaged in the activities mentioned by  Senator Maunsell  but I am aware that Papua New Guinean citizens employed temporarily on a seasonal basis on Australian pearling and other vessels in the Torres Strait have not applied in the past to Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> authorities for permission to engage in such employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From information made available to me by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I understand that on average the pearling season in the Torres Strait extends over nine months and that at the conclusion of the season it is customary for pearling vessel operators to return those Papua New Guineans employed on their vessels to Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The task force formed in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to inquire into the movement of Papua New Guineans in the Torres Strait area and in mainland Australia has examined the matter of Papua New Guineans employed temporarily on Australian pearling vessels in the Torres Strait, and policy considerations involved in regularising the situation from an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> point of view are currently under review by that task force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask whether the attention of the Minister concerned has been drawn to a report in the Melbourne  Age  of 1 September that the Federal Government approval for the Iwasaki tourist project was given despite strong objection by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the express reservations of the Departments of Defence, Industry and Commerce, Transport, Primary Industry and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that in July the Government set the staff ceiling for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs at a level consistent with the satisfactory handling of migrant applications in the Department’s offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a recent increase in the work load of several regional offices, including Sydney, as a result of the recently announced changes in Government <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and changed arrangements with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure that the introduction of this tax is a smooth and co-operative exercise, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has met representatives of the international transport and travel industries in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Bill, the Minister may appoint as authorised officers, officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or officers under the Customs Act or members of the police force of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fortunate that in principle the Opposition supports this measure because I have distinct reservations about its repercussions on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> processing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will appreciate, I was fortified by the in-depth answer she gave to me yesterday when I referred to the existing staff ceiling at the office of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings me to the question of how the decision was made that the collection of this tax would be an <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> show, and I am being perfectly bipartisan about this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time we had a very fine Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the person of the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Sydney people have to go hither and thither to Foreign Affairs for a passport and then to <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> for a re-entry visa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can hive off a normal function from <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and give it to Foreign Affairs in one case we can do it in this case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the information I have, I assume that a group of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> people will be at the airport performing this duty, and I understand that the number involved will be 16. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is beyond my comprehension why the Public Service Board, when doing its forward planning, did not feed in at least a dozen people to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> offices in Sydney and other major regional centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is, there will be an intensification of the backlog in normal <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that in the concluding words of her reply to me the Minister said it was quite possible that the remarks I made yesterday would be brought to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and that Public Service Board decisions on job placements might be accelerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The officers in the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department are going to get a lot of flack from people about delays which should really be attributed to 16 of their comrades being put on other duties which is quite an unfair position to put them in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am curious to know whether it is going to be paid at a desk or cubicle at the airport or whether people will have the choice of paying at <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> offices in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who espouses full employment I do not object, probably on grounds of job creation, to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs officers collecting this tax, but I do have grave doubts about that Department’s ability to handle the matter, because I believe it should have added forces before this system comes into operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be obtained from the city and regional offices of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs booths at airports and major seaports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs does not have an office, offices of the Bureau of Customs will be able to have stamps available, as will Department of Foreign Affairs passport offices throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That brings me to another point which was raised by  Senator Mulvihill  concerning his feeling that the Department of Foreign Affairs would have been the appropriate department through which this matter could have been handled instead of doing it through the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was one reason that it was necessary for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to handle the matter to get complete coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took note of the question with regard to staff requirements which was raised yesterday by  Senator Mulvihill  and I gave the information to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs will not restrain travel agents from issuing a ticket but before embarkation it will be expected that the tax will be paid in accordance with the tax stamp procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that last Tuesday, 3 October, a meeting was held in Sydney between officers of her Department and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and representatives of Greek welfare organisations who are looking after the interests of the 175 people charged in the recent conspiracy case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was arranged by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in conjunction with my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was probably arranged by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs; I would think the calling of the meeting was in his hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the meeting was arranged by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs because of some concern that had been expressed to him by members of the Greek community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question which I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs concerns the reported granting of visas to six white South African cricketers in what I believe is a contradiction of the United Nations policy on South Africa and the Gleneagles agreement which this Government supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia has an active <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which has encouraged people to come here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish very briefly to make an appeal to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to forge much closer links between the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs special reports section and State authorities in regard to the practice of some solicitors in Sydney who appear to be misleading people who are in Australia on tourist visas about their alleged rights to have the visas converted to permanent residency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>Secondly, he should find out what follow-up has been taken by the Department’s special reports section in, as it were, culling out these sorts of people who definitely masquerade as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> experts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It does seem to be a case in relation to which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is acting quite properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other matter to which I wish to refer concerns partly the Department of Foreign Affairs and partly the Depanment of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I speak highly of the staff of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Minister for Science  (Senator Webster)  to take up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  the staffing situation in Suva, the definition of an <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officer, the definition of a Foreign Affairs officer and whether there is some sort of tacit plot with the Fijian Government whereby because somebody in Australia happens to have a trade union background it is thought to be a good security measure to stop his 81 -year-old mother from joining him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, of course, in the past 20-odd years the pattern of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> has changed the whole face of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The existing troika, consisting of the Minister for Productivity, representative Macphee, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, Michael MacKellar and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  has to devise a more integrated policy rather than the addition of an extra Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I come now to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last night I made a plea to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  about the case of Sydney Widjaja. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not unduly want to delay the Senate so I now seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  the letter I received from the  President  of the PolishAustralian Olympic Club, copies of which have been sent to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Premier of New South Wales and the Commissioner for Community Relations, together with a copy of the protest which has been signed by a vast number of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three areas that are covered in the report are: Firstly, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, which has occurred very substantially since 1945; secondly, the influx of married women seeking and finding employment within the work force; and thirdly, the fluctuations in the proportion and number of young people who are entering the labour market, accompanied by a trend towards longer average periods of full-time education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will examine each of these three points and consider, firstly, <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a factor in the growth in the labour force over the period I have mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The direct effect of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for those 20 years was a contribution of at least 40 per cent to the annual increase in the Australian labour force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the wide differences from country to country in policies, legislation and procedures concerning <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, the entry of visitors and the taking of employment, it would not be feasible to establish a uniform approach internationally to prospective working holiday makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said, I have not a list available and I am not sure whether the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> could readily provide that information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, relates to the announcement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs yesterday as to the new points plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is it possible to ask the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to consult those bodies at an early stage to ensure that this system will not be applied arbitrarily, in view of the number of clerical details that will be required during the investigations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs would be able to respond to the matters that have been raised by  Senator Bishop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The labour force was built up as a result of substantial <span class="highlight">immigration</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it is a matter of importance I will refer it immediately to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to see whether he wishes to make a statement on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Additionally, under an arrangement with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer is writing personally to each person who acquires Australian citizenship, sending a copy of the pamphlet together with an electoral claim card and post free return envelope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee was assured that the Department had had extensive dialogue with the Public Service Board and within a month of the introduction of the tax the situation would more or less level out and the Department would have the capacity to service airports and to carry out the normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns an abortive mission that I undertook last night to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know the link between our Foreign Affairs office in Buenos Aires and our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> people, but I would like some prompting of the Foreign Affairs officers in Buenos Aires to see what the Argentinian Government is doing now that Australia has offered to take this girl. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In summary, I wonder whether the Minister is now able to advise whether this new points system involves a new section in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs; what sort of establishment will be set up to decide upon that system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As will be realised, we are dealing with the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I will ensure that the Ministers concerned are advised of the comments that have been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In dealing with the estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  Senator Mulvihill  first raised certain questions with regard to the NUMAS scheme, the Press release on which was made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKeller)  on 13 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to go right back through everything, but on 6 October last year I received a letter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  thanking me for my letter of 16 September on behalf of  Mr Van  Gameren concerning his brother-in-law,  Mr Mujeeb  Chowdary The Minister said that in order to give full consideration to the matter, it might be necessary for further inquiries to be made and that upon those inquiries being made, he would be in contact with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 9 May,  Mr Donald  Edward Charles of 100 Percy Street, Portland, who is in the saddlery and leather business, wrote to the Regional Director of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Melbourne, informing him that he had met  Mr Chowdary  while he was in Australia, that he was very pleased with the type of man  Mr Chowdary  was, and that he had an opening for  Mr Chowdary  should he be fortunate enough to be able to migrate to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to read in this place the letter I received from  Mr Chowdary  ‘s brother-in-law because it tips a large bucket on officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Delhi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that  Senator Guilfoyle,  as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, will refer this matter to  Mr MacKellar  and point out that I, like  Mr Chowdary,  am just about fed up with the delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say at the outset that I, as a senator representing the State of New South Wales, am far from satisfied at the way in which the regional office of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney is administered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 29 February- I speak from recollection- that person had been given a letter from the Department saying that his application for permanent residence had been successful, subject to normal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and health requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all have a pretty difficult job and I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has a pretty difficult job when he is handling personal cases of this nature day after day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I and my colleague  Senator Mulvihill  have withdrawn from raising these cases on the adjournment debate in the Senate for the sake of the members of the Senate, if the situation does not improve in the Sydney office of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs henceforth I will be once again on the adjournment debate raising matters concerning migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>MINISTER FOR <span class="highlight">IMMIGRATION</span> AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 21 March you asked a question without notice of  Senator Guilfoyle  in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your question concerned <span class="highlight">immigration</span> operations in Iran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no officer of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs located in Iran. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, recent events in Iran have led to a situation where the Australian Embassy is no longer in a position to continue to handle its full range of consular and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  the letter from the Greek Labor Association of Western Districts, signed by its President, and a letter from the Regional Director of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want you to make a personal representation to the Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> regarding  Mr D.  Rizos of 77 Wingram St Harris Park NSW regarding his brother Georgios Rizos from Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs Commonwealth Government Centre Chifley Square Sydney, N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policy provides for the admission, subject to certain criteria, of the spouses, dependent children, parents and fiance(e)’s of Australian residents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When our programme started in 1976, the statistics of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department stated that the total of the Portuguese Community in N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790522_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, was it requested to do so by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, which seeks a monopoly of ethnic broadcasting to the exclusion of public broadcasting stations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 May 1 979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister can explain the implications of a paragraph appearing in a judgment given by  Mr Justice  Brennan of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to a recent deportation case which stated:  lt was relevant that  Mr  Pochi’s  liability to deportation depended in part upon an apparent failure by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethic Affairs to advise him that a grant of citizenship had been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some advice on this matter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Government justify the fact that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has reported that there is a shortage of skilled labour while the Government itself, through its staff ceiling policy, refuses the intake of apprentices needed to train skilled workers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls it a fact the Australia’s reliance upon <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a source of skilled tradesmen denies training opportunities to thousands of unemployed young people, causing unnecessarily high levels of youth unemployment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other aspects more properly concern <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or customs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to develop the requirements for control of our exclusive economic zone, for most of them have little or nothing to do with defence- control of fishing, illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> or smuggling for instance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Question Time this week, I mentioned that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  had said last week in a speech in Sydney that the availability of key occupational skills continues to be an important issue even in the current economic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask again: How is it that we are still placing staff ceilings on departments and statutory authorities which could provide a pool of skilled people to meet this demand, as has been mentioned by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to speak in relation to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> officers gave me a summary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has been sitting on this case for quite a while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I do not quarrel with the definition, the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will recall that senior officers from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs reiterated that a person subject to political duress has to surface in a third country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Northern Ireland however you would have to consult the Department of Manpower Services; if you are thinking of going to live or work in the Isle of Man or one of the Channel Islands, you should first consult the Island’s <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should you obtain a new passport, the production to the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Officer of the passport enclosed with this letter on your first return to the United Kingdom will indicate your settled status and facilitate your re-admission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Failing this, you will need to satisfy the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Officer of your settled status and in this connection you may find it helpful to carry with you documents, such as bank statements, notices of income tax coding etc., relating to the earlier years of your residence in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has recently claimed that about 200,000 Vietnamese refugees have drowned while attempting to flee from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to deal firstly with a question I asked the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs when Senate Estimates Committee C was meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to direct my remarks to the appropriation for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say firstly that I believe the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has handled this extremely difficult and sensitive situation with great sensitivity and compassion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I wish to speak to the estimates for the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, today certain comments have been made which I consider to be inflammatory and which ought not be considered by the officers in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs when dealing with the problem of refugees from Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was addressing my remarks to the subject of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and ethnic affairs and responding to some comments made by  Senator Sim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the compassion which the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  showed to the Vietnamese refugees in the Philippines were to be shown in foreign policy, the larger arena, and if we made an effort to understand that Vietnam needs to be assisted, the problem of the refugees would not be so great and we would not have the RSL demanding that refugees be stopped from entering Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for showing a compassionate understanding of the problems of the people who are fleeing from that kind of regime in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister and her officers would well know that one has to work on a component basis in any <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who is at the table, and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs know the complexities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I entered the debate only to repeat what I have said to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and his officers at various <span class="highlight">immigration</span> seminars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government and its Minister for Labor and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, were fairly reasonable to the Cypriots and to the first of the Chileans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the Senate for the discussion on the Estimates of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the question is that a recommendation has been submitted to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and a direct reply on this matter will be sent to  Senator Mulvihill  as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the answer to the question which was raised is that there have not been any preliminary talks between the Attorney-General’s Department and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and it is unlikely to be a matter on which the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs would become involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a response from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to those questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first incorporation was a letter from the Regional Director of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has informed me that an appeal to the Federal Court is understood to have been entered against the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirming the Minister’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances her eligibility for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia is the same as for any other permanent resident of the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This woman is welcome to approach Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers and apply for migrant entry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel sure that the discussion in the chamber this evening, in which different points of view on a very complex problem were presented, will be of assistance to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NUMAS will ensure a system of nondiscrimination and a clear definition of qualification factors within acceptable <span class="highlight">immigration</span> categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As questions raised in the Senate Estimate committee were dealt with in writing, I believe there are no other unanswered matters in relation to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, with the exception of the two questions which I dealt with for  Senator Mulvihill  tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of Estimates Committee C I must say that in the hearings which took place on Friday, 4 May, we saw the departments of Social Security, Finance, Health, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and Veterans’ Affairs come forward with very complete accounting of their estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the intervening period- I am speaking broadly, but the Departments of Social Security, Health and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs were mentioned- it had become obvious that the need for evaluation had been realised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We realise the difficulties faced by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in dealing with the tremendous number of people who have reached this shore without going through the normal procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to raise with the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs cases which have been shown up in all their stark reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that would enhance not only the reputation of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs but also it would enhance Australia ‘s reputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister for Social Security could express to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs the concern of some honourable senators at the failure to exercise compassionate discretion on behalf of such people when these cases arise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final matter that I wish to raise involves what I call the misuse of the powers of Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs officers to seize and imprison people who perhaps have overstayed their visas or who are here illegally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those cases, let us not oppress these people by snatching them off the street by using warrants to which apparently the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has access. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask the Minister how it is possible for a Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs official to enter a house without the occupant being present, to search that house and to confiscate passports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that within the power of an official of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have gone from the general Cases about which I spoke before to these specific cases- the misuse of the powers of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials and the taking away of the freedom of those people who in some way may have misused their entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she cannot at this moment perhaps she can refer them to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He put points that I think need the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They concerned the powers of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers and the manner in which we deal with situations of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am also happy to suggest that Commonwealth Police inquiries did take place at the instigation of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, which bitterly opposed the granting by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal of a licence to Ethnic Broadcasting Association of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790530_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs still waiting for this payment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be irresponsible for Australia to refuse to fill the vacancies through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> in the hope that after a prolonged period they could be filled through domestic training schemes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is in no sense a substitute for retraining and the reverse applies also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government recognises that the supply of certain skills through <span class="highlight">immigration</span> will continue to be necessary to fill needs which arise at short notice and to acquire new skills and techniques currently not in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the course of this inquiry, the Subcommittee heard evidence from a number of departments, in particular, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, Primary Industry and Health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Two of the Committee’s recommendations are not related specifically to matters covered by the treaty, but to two quite serious problems which are beginning to affect the Torres Strait area and its community, namely, exotic animal and plant diseases and illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Illegal <span class="highlight">immigration</span> from Papua New Guinea to the Torres Strait Islands and eventually to mainland Australia is a well-known practice and one which poses a major risk of disease entering Australia through animals brought into Australian territory by Papua New Guineans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Committee heard evidence from the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on this question last August, the Department has taken measures to identify Papua New Guineans living in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Committee was pleased to hear recently that the Department is now confident that the situation is under control, it believes that this control must be continued and strengthened through expanding the number of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers permanently stationed in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since March we have had three Ministers for Foreign Affairs, three Ministers for Defence, three Ministers for Health, three Ministers for Education and Science, three Attorneys-General, two Treasurers, two Ministers for Labour and National Service, two Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, two Ministers for the Navy, two Ministers for Housing, two Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and two Ministers for Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But on this occasion he is correct and I will have to seek the information from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has, whenever possible in the past, taken action to assist the processing of applications for Australian citizenship, including those from sportsmen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present a paper entitled ‘Multiculturalism and its Implications for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Policy’ prepared jointly by the Australian Population and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Council and the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs relating to the paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular we should look at the areas of Customs- international airports, <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, drugs and quarantineand the connection with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and international crime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The question relating to a greater diversity in English language courses, professional migrants and further arrangements at language centres should be referred to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The work was funded first by the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department, and later the Commonwealth Education Department in co-operation with the Academy of Social Sciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 2 1 years since the Migration Act was passed, the character of the Australian community has markedly changed, with radical amendment to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and in the volume and nature of movements into and out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most travellers respect Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, there are some who enter or remain illegally in Australia, regarding breaches of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws and policies as offences of small significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, people who try to evade <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls should gain no advantage over those many others who, being also ineligible to migrate to Australia, are prepared to abide by the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It believes that <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws and procedures should be observed and followed just as any other Australian law should be observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> restrictions applied mainly to people of non-European origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By 1 973 discrimination on grounds of race had disappeared from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> selection policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present level of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> for settlement is relatively low, with an emphasis on encouraging only those skills in short supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, I draw the attention of honourable senators to the Minister’s statement on <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and Australia’s population of 7 June 1978 which emphasised the Government’s recognition of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> as a necessary element in economic growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are pursuing a long term approach to population building in which <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is the only directable factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Australian community is now barely reproducing itself must recommend <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy to all persons who genuinely have the future welfare of this nation in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relatively low volume of admission for settlement in more recent years inevitably prompts attempts to circumvent <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and procedures either by malpractice or by entering for allegedly temporary purposes but then staying on without authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A visa is a document or notation specifically in the form of a stamped impression in a passport, which informs the carrier company and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officer at the port of arrival in Australia that the holder, prima facie, may enter Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The search for persons who breach the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> law is an expensive and an unwanted burden on the Australian taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that on 10 August 1978 the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  announced that from that date prohibited immigrants who had been deported from Australia for any reason would be barred from re-entering Australia for a period of five years, except in the most compelling circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of these provisions arose out of the recommendations of a management review which reported on its investigation of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies and procedures in July of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the Bill will provide for a considerable increase in control capacity while new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation is being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>White Australia policy is long dead, that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy today is totally nondiscriminatory and is applied consistently to all applicants regardless of race, colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin and sex. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  says that Australia wants to protect the social and economic future of all its citizens and that therefore it has to limit the number of migrants it accepts each year and give preference to those with close family ties, and with skills, professional qualifications or experience that are in strong demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So great is the number of migrants now coming from South Africa that Australia has increased its <span class="highlight">immigration</span> staff in Pretoria to cope with the increased numbers of applications from people in Rhodesia who wish to settle in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He thought that if he put his case honestly before the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs some sympathy would be shown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migrants in Melbourne and Sydney have made allegations of bribes up to $1,500 being paid to people who pose as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers expecting that people who are making desperate, last minute attempts to stay in Australia will pay any money to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report says that the two most common reasons given for the high gains from <span class="highlight">immigration</span> are that practice in Australia was more lucrative than in many other countries and that the more restrictive conditions for migration of doctors to other countries made migration to Australia comparatively attractive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these figures were given by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suppose after knowing this, I should not have been surprised to receive the following letter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs: Is it true that the Australian Soccer Federation has put certain proposals to the Minister concerning visas for overseas footballers wishing to play in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that these proposals satisfy the requirements of both the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and soccer administrators in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that discussions have taken place between the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Soccer Federation to enable closer consideration to be given to the rules related to the entry of soccer players from overseas to engage under contract with clubs in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In providing this answer the Minister Tor <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs draws attention to the need to distinguish between inquiries about migration and formal applications for migrant entry as measures of interest in migration to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs advises me that visitors with penal records are required to demonstrate significant reasons to warrant variation of the general rule that they should not be admitted to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That program, as the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has said, has been important not only to the students who have come to this country but also in respect of our relationships with various countries, particularly those in the Asian and Pacific region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) That a Select Committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into and report on Australia’s current <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program to ascertain whether: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not know of any part of the Federal Government’s administration where the destiny of people is concerned more than it is in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one occasion in about the early 1970s when we were dealing with certain aspects of Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> estimates, I moved an amendment with the blessing of my then leader who is now an illustrious member of the High Court, the then senator but now  Mr Justice  Murphy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the Government of the day half-heartedly agreed that possibly there were facets of the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> system which coiuld be made subject to public scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because at the time of the Whitlam Government we did operate on the fringe of one facet of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> when there was friction within one segment of the Yugoslav community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it would be beneficial, even with the NUMAS system, to have such a committee to which ethnic communities which argue that they are disadvantaged can come along and give evidence, as can officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had an association with <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officials from the mid-50s when I was a shop floor steward and a Labor Council delegate and now, with  Senator Davidson,  I have the honour of sharing the chairmanship of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had experience with most of the senior officers in the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> will always be a complex area and obviously it has to be subject to public scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that recently the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in an address to the Institute of International Affairs in Queensland stated that the United Nations defined 14 million people as displaced people or people subject to political persecution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have attended a number of seminars with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Opposition shadow minister, the honourable member for Maribyrnong,  Dr Cass,  and the United Nations Refugee people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the United States congressional record we see listed a host of congressional committees which do grasp the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> nettle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very nice for our political parties to have an <span class="highlight">immigration</span> platform, but in that sort of situation one has to look at a map and say how many kilometres from the war zone a person has to be in order to be considered a political refugee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been talking with one of our highly competent officers of the Senate and it appears that the United States has on-going committees looking particularly into <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is going to become extremely complicated under the NUMAS system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is a matter of compound complexities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that an exercise such as this would give the Senate its first indepth probe into two current facets of <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although I have dealt with two areas, there are three components of immigrationfamily reunion, job skills, and political refugees- and each year the problems are going to get more difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is not a matter of puting up a few sign posts and thinking that people will go down a certain avenue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Davidson,  with his vast knowledge gained as  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council, knows that these are questions that the Senate has never answered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to look beyond that, I can think of Government members who have served in high positions on ethnic radio committees and on the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forgetting the numbers involved in <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, from a trade union point of view I might believe that there are supressed trade unionists in Chile, Uruguay and the Argentine and another honourable senator might know of people in another area who are being supressed by a different form of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> is always a hot potato, but the Canadian Parliament and the United States Congress have dealt with the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the two areas of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to which I have referred, I believe that within three months we would have a much more informed Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our sources of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> open up a virtual Pandora ‘s Box but I suggest we open up only two areas, and I leave the matter to the good sense of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Savage and disproportionate staff cuts, encroachments in the field of foreign policy by other departments such as Trade, Transport and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, administrative shackles imposed by the Public Service Board and Treasury, and pressures for the Head of the department to become a business manager rather than a policy adviser have led to a loss of departmental self-confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister say whether  Mr Urbanchich  has been a member of any Federal government committee or has participated in any way in the formulation of government <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 200 and 300 copies of that list are circulated to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> offices throughout the Commonwealth, Commonwealth Police, Customs offices throughout the Commonwealth and State police forces which ask for the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She put forward her application to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and the reply came back, firstly, that the father was eligible because of his age and, secondly, that the mother and children were not eligible, the mother because of her age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  you,  Mr President,  and honourable senators would know that the interim measure adopted in these cases- what might be almost a stop-gap measure- is for Australian members of a family to send money to their families, whether it be to Timor, Malaysia or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, concerns the standards required by the Australian Government before citizenship is granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I am unable to do that now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On top of that there are housing grants, grants for <span class="highlight">immigration</span> services, grants for health services through deficit funding of hospitals in South Australia, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mindful of the concern expressed to me by officers of several Sydney and Canberra Slovene organisations, all of whom have been victims of personal smears inflicted by  Mr Urbanchich  but who rightly feel that the prolonging of this issue is a stigma on all Australians of Slovene origin, I now ask, with their concurrence, whether the Minister will arrange immediately with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to have tabled in this Parliament documents relating to  Mr Urbanchich  ‘s entry into Australia, which would have been the basis of evaluation by <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the second part of the honourable senator’s question, I will bring it to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether Ministers for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> ever release dossiers with regard to the entry of any person into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should really commend the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Honourable Michael MacKellar, and the Victorian State Minister for Housing and Youth, Sport and Recreation,  Mr Brian  Dixon, as both of these men have displayed a very humane and sensible attitude towards immigrants, despite strong opposition from the extreme poltical wings of their parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I think it has to be conceded that because of some uncertainties about the activities of many of these organisations, the difficulties of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and any government in this country have to be recognised when it comes to such matters as the issue of travel documents and visas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is also the question of the commercial practices of these various organisations I have already referred to the issue of their entry into Australia and the difficulty that they pose for governments and for the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-59-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to an  Age  article of 5 September 1979 in which Professor Jerzy Zubrzycki, Chairman of the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council, alleges that Nazi-type racism is flourishing in Western Australia and that prejudice against non-European migrants is promoted there by a number of organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have some information on this matter from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the meeting in Perth was attended by some members of the League of Rights and of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association who identified themselves as such and were vocal in expressing their views against Asian migrants and refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia has a bipartisan non-discriminatory approach to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs would urge all Australians to channel their resources and energies towards achieving the goal with which all members of parliament will agree, of promoting a tolerant and understanding cohesive society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the refugee problem, the shortages of food, and the nature of the regime there will tend to aggravate the increase in the number of boat people, and the Government and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs have been making major efforts in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then one gets an extraordinary sort of statement from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is a bit sensitive to this issue from the point of view of his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply- I appreciate what the honourable senator has said and that he has informed the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer also to the general <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls that are stringently enforced in regard to the admission into Australia of known criminals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 relates to an amendment of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Ordinance of the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Government must have some control over <span class="highlight">immigration</span> into the Territory, as indeed it has complete control over the influx of aliens into Australia, but the cases I have mentioned indicate that the final say should not be left to the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>asked the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1979: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best answer I got was that it was thought that the Regional Director of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Brisbane had spoken to the people concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether the statement made by  Mr MacKellar,  the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, on 28 September 1979 is in any sense a definitive statement of the Government’s view on this matter or whether we can still expect a statement from the Minister and, if so, when. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Button  would know, the Minister responsible for this matter is the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Budget was brought down it has been abundantly clear to all that the actual servicing of this matter would be done by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs at the point of visa and at the commencement of the entry to Australia of the student concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has always been regarded by the Government as a matter of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and not primarily of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a statement released today by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs concerning the ethnic television service which says, amongst other things, that the Government commits itself to a continuation of the present Special Broadcasting Service experimental service broadcast over the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs seen the report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking as one who has seen the work of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on the refugee island of Bidong in the South China Sea, can the Minister indicate whether departmental officers have any specific instructions relating to the family distribution situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Some specific cases which were raised in the article are being investigated by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Father Foale, the  President  of the IndoChinese Refugee Association, has been appointed to the Australian Refugee Advisory Council, whose membership was announced on 7 October by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average population growth in Australia between 1950 and 1970 was 1.9 per cent, representing an increase of 1.1 per cent by natural growth and .8 per cent by <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We wanted to work towards an objective of 1.1 per cent increase or thereabouts from natural growth and <span class="highlight">immigration</span> combined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that over a period I have insisted that the Government ‘s broad <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy needs constant monitoring to ensure that, however we categorise people who are suffering from economic or political suppression and kindred problems, we have an even balance in our intake of immigrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs (  Mr MacKellar)  has knowledge of that case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be agreed that neither the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs nor the Department of Foreign Affairs are very sure about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has advised me that the Government has increased the program for Indo-Chinese refugees to 14,000 for this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think this legislation results from a statement on consular matters made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 26 May 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Papua New Guineans have been using the islands as a bridge to Australia, and there has been increased activity by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to prevent that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I believe that in some way we must maintain <span class="highlight">immigration</span> control in the area, nevertheless we ought not to be so stupid as to try to stop every little gap and loophole to prevent a Papua New Guinean coming into the Torres Strait Islands, staying there with friends for six months, taking a new name and becoming a relative of a Torres Strait islander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, relates to Vietnamese citizens seeking to migrate to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Has any progress been made in reaching agreement with Vietnamese authorities to allow Australian <span class="highlight">immigration</span> officers to conduct necessary interviews with these people within Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commence by noting the reference by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Groom),  as recorded at page 2096 of the House of Representatives  Hansard,  to those in the community who actively encourage the circumvention of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think there is an honourable senator here who at times has not found that a travel agent has misrepresented our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having paid commission to a travel agent, they often ask honourable senators to carry out what I would call a mission impossible and try to make a case to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for some form of clemency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have expressed criticism and irritation to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs via the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  but I have been equally vocal when I have complained to the New South Wales Minister who is responsible for the New South Wales Travel Agents Registration Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot express too much my amazement at why the special reports branch of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, the Commonwealth Police and the various State travel agency registration bodies do not get together more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last 48 hours a Press release has been issued by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and his counterparts in the various State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In broad terms there seems to be a tendency for the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Productivity and the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to do their own thing with job expectancy statistics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have attended with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs seminars at which people have said that Australia is a large country whose potential is unlimited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I had a talk the other night with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs says: ‘Let us strike a target’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the officers from the Minister’s Department know that when they are dealing with personality- that is what <span class="highlight">immigration</span> is all about- it is pretty hard to stick to set rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has to convince these particular people that whatever policies are endorsed at the United Nations they should not dispossess people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is there anything in the legislation that negates action by a trade union to see that, in addition to a penalty being imposed on the employer for breaking the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> laws, the employer is also prosecuted for underpaying the person concerned? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The BUI proposes to amend the Migration Act to give effect to recommendations made by a joint management review, which comprised a consultant, a Public Service Board member, a departmental member and a member on exchange from the Canadian Employment and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Commission, which in 1978 inquired into migrant entry, control policies and the procedures related to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everybody in the Senate is well aware of the quite magnificent program of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that has taken place in this country over the last 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are all very well aware that the character of the Australian community has changed and that there has been some considerable amendment to <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies with the volume and nature of movements of people coming into and moving out of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent to those of us who have worked closely with the field of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> that the task of control and admission, of allowing people to remain or otherwise, has become extremely difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar has said, the Act is a 1958 measure being tested by 1979 circumstances, and the speech admits that the Act has been found wanting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the second reading speech states, people who try to evade <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls should have no advantage over those many others who, also being ineligible to migrate to Australia, are prepared to abide by the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in this world of emigration and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, it is a fundamental and internationally accepted principle that every country has the right to determine who may enter and, what is equally important, who may remain within its boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very glad that the second reading speech mentioned what I would call the history of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and the Migration Act in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Immigration</span> restrictions applied mainly to people of nonEuropean origin and the occupational categories which were sought by the Australian community covered the whole spectrum of occupations, including unskilled workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak on this matter with some feeling and, I hope, with some understanding because for a number of years it was my privilege to occupy the position of  Chairman  of the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia must take the time, as circumstances permit, to give very serious consideration to our attitude to this position and to the effect and influence it will have on our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program and on the kind of people we will receive into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the kind agencies of our Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur and the officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, I was able to visit that island, with its 33,000 refugees, and to move among those refugees for the best part of a day in conditions of heat and humidity which to me were quite indescribable and extremely uncomfortable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people hope that they might gain admission to English language countries and English speaking countries and take their place in those communities and be a part of the great <span class="highlight">immigration</span> program which extends across the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter of entry and control policies has always loomed large in Australia’s development of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth power with respect to <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take that point and simply put it to the Minister that if, after she or the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has had an opportunity, in consultation with his advisers to look at the points that I am making in order to satisfy himself or herself that I am not stretching too long a legal bow and that there is that possibility of that interpretation, I would be happy if the Minister could give some assurance that, following such an examination, the legislation would be repealed or amended at some appropriately convenient point of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps at the outset I should say that the legislation before the Senate will meet some of the needs of the times by tightening <span class="highlight">immigration</span> controls and by introducing new penalties and increasing existing penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the legislation is to make essential amendments to the existing legislation, and it will provide a considerable increase in control capacity while new <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation is being developed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of other matters could arise in that study of what is required <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was asked by  Senator Mulvihill  whether I could give an assurance that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs would seek to place on the agenda of the next meeting of State Ministers the matter of travel agents and their activities with regard to misleading people who intend to immigrate to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I am able to give the assurance that I will draw it to the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and, as this is a matter of concern to him as well as to  Senator Mulvihill,  I can assure that, if it is appropriate, the Minister will seek to have this matter placed on the agenda for discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendments proposed in this Bill will not affect <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I understand it, Interpol information is normally made available to police forces and not directly to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that would be a bipartisan approach to refugee problems and <span class="highlight">immigration</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As he stated, the Labor Government in 1973 amended the Crimes Act to repeal provisions which enabled the AttorneyGeneralnot the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs- to order the deportation of a person, not born in Australia, who had been guilty of certain offences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I give an undertaking from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  with whom I discussed the matter briefly during the dinner recess, that the Government would be looking at this question and would be able to make an appropriate response when the new legislation is brought down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is appalling that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs seems very uninformed about Government activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment I am negotiating with the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on behalf a man who is in an Adelaide gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  stated that in reply to a question today, but officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs do not know that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it was said by the present Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  at the National Press Club that a country gears itself on its annual intake subject to economic conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since <span class="highlight">immigration</span> was severed from the Department of Labour and <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, and some of its functions also went to the Department of Foreign Affairs, many more people have travelled overseas and many post-war migrants have become permanent residents and taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accept the Minister’s statement that at the next meeting with State Ministers dealing with <span class="highlight">immigration</span>, restrictions on travel agents will be discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  said in the second reading speech, it is to defray the costs of the overseas administration of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that the charges levied in this Bill are designed to save the Government some $4m- about 12 per cent of the administrative costs of the overseas operations of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Mulvihill  sees an enormous number of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this measure, intending visitors and migrants will be asked to provide $4m a year to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I assured him when we were debating the previous Bill, that issue will be considered by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and I hope that it will be raised with the appropriate State Ministers for their discussion and consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The testing of private students is a fairly formal process conducted by officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, or the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I ought to draw attention to a recent answer by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to a question on notice, in which he assured members of parliament that that charge will not apply to representations which they make on behalf of their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been said and was clearly stated in the second reading speech, the Bill does relate to some cost recovery of charges relating to permits and other <span class="highlight">immigration</span> matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a Bill which will allow some cost recovery for the many services which are provided by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the Estimates Committee C proceedings the Minister’s departmental officers made it abundantly clear that there are some people who would come into the country under the supervision of the Department of Foreign Affairs and not under the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I had in mind was that there are certain professional bodies which examine candidates overseas and for whom the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs provides services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where inquiries are made directly to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs the normal service will be provided free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I understand him correctly, there will be no difference between charges for services whether the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or the Department of Foreign Affairs provides the service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words if the instance he has in mind is where the Department of Foreign Affairs would need to determine refugee status and the service is provided, it would not matter whether it was the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs handling the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate last evening on the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> legislation, I commented that even with the wisdom of Solomon many problems will not be able to be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is more directly involved than my Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the war, Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy rightly did not distinguish between Yugoslavs who had served in World War II who came here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence I am standing here speaking to this legislation because it is presented by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and not the Minister for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs delivered a similar statement in the House of Representatives on 22 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs said in his Press release on the matter that the exemption would be given only to students on fully reciprocal agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it be the Commonwealth Department of Education or will it be the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation has to be seen within the context of an overall policy in terms of changing migration policies which were outlined by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in the House of Representatives on 22 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer specifically and, indeed, in some detail to the publication by the Australian Union of Students and the Western Australian Institute of Technology Guild which prepared a submission to the Minister for Education and the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preamble to the report in the chapter headed ‘Summary of Submission’ indicates, for instance, that there is an alleged proposal to ‘force them to leave Australia immediately on completion of their courses despite the fact that the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has indicated that there are a number of ways in which that matter can be dealt with and that the element of forcing them to leave Australia is quite incorrect in that sense although the idea that they should return to their home countries is one supported not only by the Government but by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The submission goes on to deal with the administrative problems which presumably AUS has a far greater appreciation of than the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 refer to a comment by the then Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span>, the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in 1973 the Labor Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> put clearly in perspective what this scheme was and what it was not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before proceeding to a general discussion of the Bill, I wish to make some comment on part of the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in the House of Representatives on 22 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the consequences for education in Australia, Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy and Australia’s foreign policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a similar way the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs or perhaps the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  or perhaps both, have had imposed on them these overseas students charge Bills, despite the fact that they introduce clear inconsistency into our educational policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They revive, whether justly or not, suspicions that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies are racist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some of the overseas countries there are suspicions that our <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policies are racist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This measure that we are debating tonight, which imposes fees on students who are going to come from overseas countries to study in our universities and colleges of advanced education, will only reinforce the feelings in overseas countries that we have a racist <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we could add the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs as well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has said that many people are well able to afford such costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate tonight a number of references have been made to the statement made by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  when speaking in the House of Representatives in August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is remarkable that this Bill should be brought into the Senate under the auspices of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  when it is very clear from the wording of the Bill that the charges involved are imposed on a student in respect of his enrolment in a tertiary institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mere fact that the machinery is under the control of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs does not disguise the fact that this is a fee to do with enrolment in a tertiary institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this Bill is to be under the control of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, who is an aspirant to the foreign affairs portfolio, it is remarkably insensitive to the foreign policy implications involved in this exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To answer  Senator Hamer’s  interjection precisely, as I recall it, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs claimed that somewhere between 70 per cent and 75 per cent of overseas students apply for, and are granted, permanent resident status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ethnic welfare rights officers were first transferred to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs from the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have asked the authorities and I have spoken to the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Michael  MacKellar, who is a most sympathetic person, to endeavour to bring about with the Indonesian Government the scrapping of this list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: ( 1 ), (2) and (3) the Report of the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services for Migrants (the Galbally Report) recommended increased Government assistance to migrants across a wide range of activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A comprehensive account of progress made in implementing the Report is contained in the Galbally Information Kit tabled by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on 27 September 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attached tables give details of specific projects approved under Recommendations administered by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-59-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be brutally frank, I asked a leading question that came partly within the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and partly within the responsibility of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> about immigrants to Australia who could have been involved in nazi collaboration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to be here when I ask questions about this man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret to say that when that report came down the Minister of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  proceeded to attack  Dr Grassby  rather strongly on the program  AM. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respect for individual liberties often seems to stop short at members of unpopular minority groups, and hostility and prejudice over <span class="highlight">immigration</span> have fostered a climate where it is difficult, even if the effort is made, to ensure that elementary considerations of humanity extends to the procedures for deciding applications to enter the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there are other bodies such as the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Control Association; the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Restriction Council; the British Australian Association; the Ku Klux Klan, Melbourne branch; the Conservative Party (Western Australia) Inc.; Women Against Asian <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Committee; Westralian Nationalist Movement; National Australian Association; Truth and Liberty Mission; British-Israel World Federation; and the Children of God. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, concerns Vietnamese refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has made many comments with regard to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every day of every week the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  considers the issuing of deportation orders against people who come to this country and seek to stir up racial hatred and racial opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Migration Act, Sections 12, 13 and 48- Deportation of aliens and immigrants and directions not to act as <span class="highlight">immigration</span> agent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again in the <span class="highlight">immigration</span> and citizenship area where appeals are necessary- these matters are the subject of a great deal of investigation, thought and recommendation- there is no significant appellate jurisdiction in the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the general proposition that  Senator Mulvihill  has put in regard to the distinction between rights under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and recourse to the Ombudsman are broadly correct, except that there has been a right of appeal in respect of deportation decisions under sections 12 and 13 of the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Act, which perhaps qualifies the views he expressed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though he had succeeded in an appeal, if the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs appealed to a federal court the person to whom the order referred would still be detained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Minister is going overseas for up to six weeks, is there anything in the Bill where there is an obligation on the acting Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> to act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is a reference to Australia’s <span class="highlight">immigration</span> policy, which applies to all peoples of the world other than refugees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I had sought the assistance of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs to provide translators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> had the mistaken idea that if it prepared anything it would be taking sides on what it thought was a trade union ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the credit of  Mr Linehan,  I told him of the lack of cooperation I was getting from the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I warned the Director of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> in Sydney that I was taking the matter to the employment and relations people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I read paragraphs 6.8 to 6.14 of this report tonight, it appeared that the agreement I reached with  Mr Linehan  and the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Department had not become a reality and that these matters were still being looked at. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Government will put its money where its <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs Minister’s mouth is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Guilfoyle: The Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator’s question- (1), (2), (3): The Report of the Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services for Migrants (the Galbally Report) recommended increased Government assistance to migrants across a wide range of activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A comprehensive account of progress made in implementing the Report is contained in the Galbally Information Kit tabled by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs on 27 September 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The other matter I raise is typical of the sorts of difficulties that occur in the mopping up process after the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has approved a permanent resident status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs been ordered to recall pamphlets on the Numerical Multifactor Assessment Scheme of migrant selection, or.NUMAS as it is often called? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will seek advice on it from the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs and perhaps encourage him to make a statement in case there is any public concern about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Opposition’s spokesman on <span class="highlight">immigration</span>,  Dr Cass,  stated last week during the debate on this Bill in another place the Opposition does not oppose the establishment of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Institute is to be governed by a council consisting of the Government appointed Director of the Institute, the Secretary of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, a Government appointed chairman and three to six other members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to 100 persons will be appointed as members of the Institute by the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, so I suppose it is not to be expected that that group will cause the Government any trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his second reading speech, the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  said that one of the early objectives of the Institute would be to define multiculturalism and then to follow that through with various worthy aims, which would include the development of awareness among cultural and ethnic groups, the promotion of tolerance, understanding and mutual esteem, the promotion of cohesiveness through existing political and legal structures, and the promotion of an environment conducive to participation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is very little evidence that the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs would do more than pay lip service to that aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just witnessed the case of the small welfare rights program which was transferred to the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs from the Department of Social Security, where it was very effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs annihilated this program without consultation with the ethnic groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs got hold of this welfare rights program, it quickly cut it off in its prime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not being done satisfactorily at the moment, it is clear, by the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter whether there was a Liberal Government or a Labor Government, it was always felt that the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council did not politicise on a party basis by having a link with the Government and/or Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Gordon  Davidson served on the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council for much longer than I did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what  Senator Grimes  said about the way these people are elected: It could be done in a much better way, having regard to the tried and true formula as applied by the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council over a long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another concern of the Opposition, expressed in paragraph (c) of the amendment, was that we should elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of <span class="highlight">immigration</span> to Australia and issues related to the development of the ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that discussions have already been held by officers of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs with those of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies to develop appropriate procedures for the future co-ordination of work programs and policies with those of the Institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we are all aware of his experience and of his association with the <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it may be appropriate that I draw the attention of the Minister for <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs (  Mr MacKellar)  to the comments that were made by  Senator Mulvihill  to see whether we can achieve a parliamentary interest, a non-partisan interest, in the affairs of the Institute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-103-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of these houses 20 are allocated to refugees as interim accommodation on the recommendation of the Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs, and 52 are being allocated as the need arises to refugees sponsored by interested organisations in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department of <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> and Ethnic Affairs is aiming to actively involve the community in the national process of re-settling the considerable number of refugees now coming into Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-127-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the recent Conference of State <span class="highlight">Immigration</span> Ministers consider (a) the lack of uniformity in State recognition of non-British degrees in various professions, for example, Veterinary Science, (b) the need for uniform adoption laws, and (c) closer supervision of small loan agencies which disregard normal interest charges when dealing with migrant clients. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>
