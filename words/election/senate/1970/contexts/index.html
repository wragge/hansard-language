<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, ls it not clear that the Government’s proposals for improvements in the health scheme are going to cost about twice what the Government said in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign would be the cost? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party presented these issues to the people in the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year, and as a result was very narrowly defeated by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also assure us that there has been no change in the Government’s promise, made 6 weeks after the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, that it would be a case of one out all out and that we would withdraw all our troops rather than withdraw one battalion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing the Minister’s willingness to encourage conciliation and arbitration in the settlement of differences of opinion between persons, I ask: Will the Minister whose knowledge and support of the state aid for education policy are well known, use his best efforts to settle the cleavage of pre-Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span> opinion said to exist between our Victorian senatorial colleagues, Senators Brown and Poyser, on the question of state aid? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the stated policy of this Government prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> was that it would investigate the making of special financial assistance grants to rural municipalities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government also give an assurance that such incredible open ended contracts as that signed to cover the purchase of the Fil ls will never again be entered into and that major defence issues will never again be used as <span class="highlight">election</span> bait? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700513_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister, in his policy speech for the 1’969 <span class="highlight">election</span>, promise to reduce taxation for lower and middle income earners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Prime Minister honour his <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to provide over 3 years, beginning with the 1970 Budget, tax relief to the extent of $200m on personal incomes? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister refute suggestions that the Prime Minister does not now propose to honour his <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking to give such relief to lower and middle income earners? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely one can put only one interpretation on this: The debate was initiated in an attempt to hurt the Government on the eve of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs noted the results of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Vietnam as reported in today’s Press? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not the fact that 4 major parties each polled approximately 1 million votes the truest possible indication of the existence of free elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I hear such comments made by way of interjection I feel that I must again direct attention to what happened when the enemies of South Vietnam tried in all ways, including bombing orphanages and other places, to frustrate the conduct of a proper democratic <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister not think it rather illogical that he should ask the Opposition to co-operate with the Government in respect of the order of business when the Prime Minister .refuses to disclose the proposed date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I may be permitted to do so, I should like to point out that nobody will be surprised about the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>; it will be either late in November or some time next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only people who will be inconvenienced will be those of us in the Senate who are expected to co-operate with the Government in these circumstances, knowing that at any time we may be given 3 weeks’ notice that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is traditional and normal for the Prime Minister to announce when proposed elections are to be held and I do not see that the circumstances are any different on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This practice has continued for the whole time that elections have been held for the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH I would say to the honourable senator is that I am sure that the Prime Minister will announce the date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at the appropriate time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we welcome the announcement thai the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held on 21st November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave - The Senate will be aware that to fulfil the requirements of the Constitution the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> must be held before 30th June 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, the Government has decided to invite His Excellency the Governor-General to communicate with the State Governors proposing that the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> be held on Saturday, 21st November 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When replies have been received from the States I shall inform the Senate of the full timetable proposed for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say, in response to the first question, that honourable senators will recall that in my statement I said that when replies had been received from the States following the invitation issued to  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral to act on the matter, a full timetable proposed for the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very alive to the need and I have it clearly in my sights that when we come back on the Tuesday after this break we will have to face up to our timetable and all matters relating to the time between then and when we rise for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, too, welcome the announcement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  of the date for the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 welcome the announcement of the <span class="highlight">election</span> date because to have imposed the receipts tax, particularly on the Queensland taxpayers, would have been most unfair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform you,  Mr President,  and all other honourable senators that the action of the Government in introducing these savage increases is going to be a great issue at the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When can senators expect to see a preview of a film aimed at educating voters to avoid informal votes in the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the commentary for which is to be given by Bill Peach who spearheaded the successful ‘This Day Tonight’ programme? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen a Press report that  Mr Whitlam  and  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, spoke from the same platform to open the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last night? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With  Mr Whitlam  and  Mr Hawke  speaking from the same platform to open the same Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, does this not align  Mr Whitlam  and the Australian Labor Party with  Mr Hawke  and his policy of a 35-hour working week and the militant use of costly and disruptive strikes if necessary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister approved any proposals to ensure that as far as practicable a minimum of informal votes will be registered at the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask further: With the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held on 21st November, can the Leader of the Government convey any information as to the outcome of the serious division in Labor ranks, in Victoria at least, as noted by the very large Labor meeting which expressed- (Opposition senators interjecting) - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Setting aside <span class="highlight">election</span> pledges I wish to refer to the letter written by  Senator Bishop  which he quoted a few minutes ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I inform the Senate that I have received certificates of the choice at the <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 2 1st November 1970 of senators to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Clerk  then laid on the table (he certificates of <span class="highlight">election</span> of John Thomas Kane for the State of New South Wales and George Conrad Hannan for the State of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Leader of  the Government in the Senate give some explanation of the unprecedented events which have occurred in the last week, by which a Prime Minister who waselected by the people of Australia has been replaced as Prime Minister by a person whom the Liberal and Country parties were not prepared to put forward to the people at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> as the prospective Prime Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education and Science by informing the Minister that students of the Tweed River High School publish a school newspaper and that during a recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign they invited both Labor and Liberal candidates to contribute an article. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710331_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J ask: In view of the fact that the then Prime Minister gave an <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking in 1969 that, this gap would be maintained “at 80c for a surgery visit and $1.20 for a home visit, will the Minister now give an assurance that this promise will be honoured and the gap will nol be widened during the term of this Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  as Leader of the Government in the Senate I offer, on behalf of all honourable senators in the first instance, my congratulations to  Senator Prowse  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Australian Country Party I offer congratulations to you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the presidency of the Senate and extend to you our very best wishes for a long and rewarding term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following my <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position of  President  of the Senate, I have to Inform youthat I wish to withdraw from the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Clerk  then laid on the table the certificate of <span class="highlight">election</span> of Neville Thomas Bonner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to report that, accompanied by honourable senators, I have presented myself to  His Excellency  the Governor-General as the choice of the Senate, and  His Excellency  was pleased to congratulate me on my <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the office of  President  of the Senate, an office which is one of the highest in the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I wish to add by way of underlining the facts is that it is a very idle use of question time for the Opposition in the Senate to talk about the candidates for a Vietnam <span class="highlight">election</span> when elections, as we know them, have no vestige of existence in the Communist parties which are opposing the establishment of democracy in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While  Senator Sim  was speaking this evening I interjected and stated that the then Prime Minister of Australia had said that if a free <span class="highlight">election</span> were held in Vietnam the Communists would win it, or words to that effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must, therefore, not overlook the possibility that a free <span class="highlight">election</span> may be an <span class="highlight">election</span> which establishes a Communist administration in the whole of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not there could be a free <span class="highlight">election</span>, the then Prime Minister was of the belief that if there were a free <span class="highlight">election</span> the Communists would win it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present the statistical returns from each of the 6 States showing the voting within each subdivision in relation to the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> on 21st November 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711027_senate_27_s50/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McManus was absent on 17th August when the certificates of <span class="highlight">election</span> of honourable senators to serve in the Senate on 1st July 1971 were tabled in the Senate and senators were then sworn in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: What action is being taken to implement the indication by a former Prime Minister that the franchise would be extended to 18-year-olds before the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, what is proposed to be done about those 18-year-olds who are already entitled to vote in the elections which take  place  in South Australia and Western Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition amendment proposes that instead of the form of application for a postal vote to be used at an <span class="highlight">election</span> being in accordance with a form issued under the authority of the Chief Electoral Officer and specified by him by notice in the Gazette, there should be a form of a colour specified by him by notice in the Gazette. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This does not prevent the Chief Australian Electoral Officer from specifying a colour but the proposal in the Bill is more flexible in that it allows him to identify the form by some other means, for example, by the words ‘1977 <span class="highlight">Election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be a standard form for every <span class="highlight">election</span> but before each <span class="highlight">election</span> the Commonwealth Electoral Office would promulgate that for the next <span class="highlight">election</span> the colour would be, I say, green. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason that we have moved that there ought to be different colours and not different forms for each <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That, although we accept the verdict of the Australian people in the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>, we do not accept the right of a Governor-General to dismiss a Prime Minister who maintains the confidence of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The clause states: ordinary general <span class="highlight">election</span>’ means a general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives next following a House of Representatives that expired or was dissolved at or towards the end of the period of 3 years from the first meeting of that House; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister further inform the Parliament whether the lack of enrolment cards and the inability of the Department to have enrolment cards readily available is part of an overall strategy by certain people in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to prevent enrolments, in order to consolidate the position of certain sitting members when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is eventually held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that the Prime Minister used the loans affair to achieve government and in view of the statement apparently made by the former AttorneyGeneral that the Prime Minister wanted the Sankey case to be taken over so as to terminate it, would the Minister not consider that it would be the general public’s thinking that it is rather odd, in view of the Prime Minister’s previous views before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that he does not want the matter to be prosecuted to the full, and that if there is nothing wrong this case should proceed in order to prove that the men charged are innocent or to prove that they are guilty if they are guilty? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I intend to say a little more about how that quick selection came about on four occasions, not through the fault of the Australian Labor Party, but because of the very undemocratic actions taken by the people who now sit opposite, in collusion with that person who is now known, I suppose, as ‘The Phantom of Paris’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the stations mentioned in connection with part ( 1 ) of the question, the following stations were not granted an exemption under section 1 16 (4a) of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, by the Tribunal in respect of the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for the period midnight 20 September to close (8.00 p.m.) of poll, 23 September 1978: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Senate requests the Government to re-examine the requirement, contained in Public Service Board General Order 3/D/4, that an officer or employee of the Public Service who wishes to nominate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to a House of Parliament must resign ‘before nomination’, on the ground that the wording and effect of that provision may be contrary to the provision of section 44 (iv) of the Constitution, which provides that any such person, holding an office of profit under the Crown, shall be incapable of being ‘chosen or of sitting’ as a senator or member of the House of Representatives, in relation to which a conditional resignation, contingent upon being chosen, might be regarded as sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790918_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember- my memory was jogged by  Senator Evans  during his speech- that one of the most inhuman, unchristian and rotten things to have been done in this country in recent years against human rights was done by  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  at the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> when, for political purposes or reasons, he denied to helpless and harmless Aboriginal people the receiving of eye treatment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased that he is the shadow Minister for Primary Industry because the farmers of this country will reject him and his policy whenever the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  decides to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The longer he remains in the portfolio of the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, the more rural seats this Government will win at any <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I address a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, ls there any truth in the statement that the new health benefits scheme, originally estimated in the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech of the Prime Minister to cost $16m, is now estimated to cost an extra $S8m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700303_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could not this <span class="highlight">election</span> promise be regarded as a blatant political falsehood by the Liberal Party to win votes at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700303_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following upon an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives and the filling of two vacancies in the Senate the Governed was returned to Office with a greatly reduced majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Prime Minister can be reasonably satisfied with the <span class="highlight">election</span> result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another factor influencing the <span class="highlight">election</span> result was the outward appearance of unity that emanated from the Opposition during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these factors, and taking into account the relevant problems associated with them, I believe that the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> from the point of view- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, I was referring to the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, the Leader who took the Opposition to the people in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these factors, and taking into account the relevant problems associated with people in country areas compared with their city brothers, I believe that the result in the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> from the point of view of the Australian Country Party was most gratifying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is some change over in industry it creates rather a sombre thought and it is not always news value, lt is one of the many things in this report which is virtually a vindication of what the Australian Labor Party has said, and particularly in various speeches which were made last year in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the result of which gave this Government a tremendous shock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that on this occasion, which occurred during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign,  Senator Georges  was with me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My theme is that the Government is virtually endorsing what the Labor Party said during and prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  saying with considerable eloquence during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that a Labor government would do certain things in regard to foreign policy which would make it most dangerous to elect such a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister in his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign said this: ‘We shall not sign the Treaty until we are sure that it is an effective treaty, that it provides protection to its signatories and that Australia’s security in the future is not endangered’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not think one will hear much more about that, as a result of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do nol want to be led away, but  Senator Cavanagh  has asked this interesting question: Why would wc not permit a free <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T shall give  Senator Cavanagh  one reason- there are many others - why one would not agree to a free <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would  Senator Cavanagh  guarantee, or could he guarantee, that there could have been free elections in North Vietnam in 1956? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we hear from  Senator Cavanagh  that we should have permitted free elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would Ho Chi Minh have allowed free elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, 1 think this was spelt out by my own leader in his policy speech at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is essential at the present time to point out that on vital issues the Government must take a different attitude from that which it took in pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the ALP has from the commencement of the Vietnam campaign opposed in some strength Australian participation in that area, it has found it difficult to overcome the argument that the Government’s decision to place troops in Vietnam was endorsed by the public as shown by previous <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and try to hold post-mortems on why there was a collapse on the part of the Government, I would direct honourable senators’ attention to my Budget speech made on 10th September last, before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that speech the results of the <span class="highlight">election</span> were anticipated and put on record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that <span class="highlight">election</span> the ALP polled 46.97% of the votes throughout Australia; the Liberal Party polled 34.78%; the Australian Country Party polled 8.54%; the DLP polled 6.02%; the Australia Party polled .87% - I do not know whether that is the reason for the resignation of its leader; and the Communist Party polled 08%, with other groups polling 2.73%. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> results do not endorse the Government’s policy of involvement in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vietnam was one of ihe issues on which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was fought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A study of the <span class="highlight">election</span> results shows that the seats which give the present Government its majority were seats won by candidates whose names were higher on the alphabetical list than the name of their Labor Party opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its legislation cannot be judged again on what the people decided at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a direction, supported by public opinion, as shown by the <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas prior to the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government may have been able to claim justification for being in Vietnam it cannot do so now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the first time for many years we are able to envisage, from what we have been told and from the number of Bills which have been introduced in another place and which will be ready shortly for debate in this chamber - Bills of vital importance for the development of this country - that we will be able to honour the promises given by the Government prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In about 1925-26 the Australian wool growers held an <span class="highlight">election</span> to determine whether to continue with this so-called reserve price system or go back to the free auction system without a reserve price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the last: <span class="highlight">election</span> I supported such a plan and I still support a reserve price plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promises regarding health was approximately $16m, but now 1 am led to believe that the figure is in the vicinity of $32m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was pointed out in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  put forward a proposal for a subsidy to reduce by 2% the interest paid by newly weds in their first 10 years of marriage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never known of an <span class="highlight">election</span> except those in 1943 and 1946 when the likes of the honourable senator have not put  a  smear on members who stood for the Australian Labor Party, and I have had enough of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, let me refer to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened to the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr McEwen)  when he, and no doubt others, thought in the last week before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the position was not so secure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know what happened at the 1931 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every time honourable senators opposite take part in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign their first thought is to say that those people who carry the banner of the Australian Labor Party are Communists, are mixed up with the Communists or are fellow travellers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700310_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that as British citizens they would be able to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The act of placing his name on the electoral roll entitles him to nominate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate, subject to the nomination being signed by ten or more people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that in due course the Government will attempt to translate it into Bill form to implement the promises given either during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  or which appear in this document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Government and the people of Australia that we recognise the confidence that has been placed in us as a result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 25th October 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could go on to 1954 and read the agreements which we drew up, such as the Geneva Accords of 1954, which we breached because we were not prepared to hold elections in Vietnam because, as  President  Eisenhower said clearly: If you hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Vietnam at this time the country will choose a Communist Government’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, after pressure has been brought to bear and after the  results  of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government has decided, firstly, to allow deductions from the salaries of Commonwealth public servants - which is a great service to credit unions - and, secondly, to allow the savings of credit unions to be recognised under conditions which are rather startling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But these are the people who supported the Government at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have this Government in the position that it had to hang back until the <span class="highlight">election</span> was over before it dared to put  even ils signature on the Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen the Government’s initial bungling compounded by all sorts of evasions, putting things off from <span class="highlight">election</span> to <span class="highlight">election</span>, and the plain fact is that there has been a lack of that defence equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall to mind the television scenes of the late Prime Minister coming out through the crowds after <span class="highlight">election</span> meetings when Labor supporters, Communists and others tried to frighten him and howl him down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the following <span class="highlight">election</span> the people re-elected him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was bad enough, but 1 then went into the Parliamentary Library and read in a Maxwell Newton publication that I am regarded as a right wing candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These have acquired a new status and a greater value in the Parliament of Australia and indeed, if I may put it this way, within the public life of Australia because they provide opportunities for senators, in particular, to apply themselves in addition to parliamentary duties to various areas - either those in which they are interested or those to which they are assigned by the Parliament in the course of their <span class="highlight">election</span> to the various committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Freeth  was defeated at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> and has now been appointed as our Ambassador to Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We fought the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the health policies of each Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Labor Party’s scheme received a lot of attention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the main reason for the support we got in the <span class="highlight">election</span> was the proposals contained in our health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a function which in its discharge is receiving the approval of the Australian people and it will continue to receive it by the confirmation of the presence of our retiring senators in this place at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> later this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  survived the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> and has come back with renewed strength. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year for the Senate, and possibly two members of the DLP will conclude their terms in this Parliament on 30th June 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion it does not suit the DLP’s plans to feed off its favourite host, the Liberal Party, and it felt that because this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year for the Senate it would change and have a bit of a suck at the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the DLP were shown up in their true colours when they made a lot of fuss and bother about  Mr Gordon  Freeth’s statement on Russian presence in the Indian Ocean, but when <span class="highlight">election</span> time came their preferences went to their old hosts, their good friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an evasion by the Government of its responsibility and it was said to give some credence to what the people were told during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to bring into operation for repatriation Service pensioners the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  that the Government would introduce legislation providing increased pensions for married means test pensioners who lose the economies of living together because of failing health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In my State of Western Australia - everyone will admit this - there was the greatest racket in the world to keep the quota announcement back and post it on the day of the <span class="highlight">election</span> so that the farmers received (heir quotas on the Monday following the Saturday <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, when the Opposition was desperate, the Australian Labor Party declared in wheat growing areas in Victoria that it would fight to the last ditch any attempt to impose quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Dame  Annabelle Rankin suggested in her second reading speech the proposal carries out, in part in my view, the promise made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Government would pay pensions at the standard rate instead of at the married rate to aged couples who, by reason of failing health, lose the economies of living together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We appreciate that if the separation was for a week or a fortnight it probably would be impracticable to carry out the general philosophy that is contained in the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> statement and in the Bill itself, but we would like further information as to the precise grounds on which the Director-General will be satisfied - whether it will be medical opinion or whether a time factor will come into it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700319_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my State of Victoria at the end of May there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Australian Labor Party is claiming that because of the unpopularity of the Government it has the best opportunity for years of winning the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result was that in those days no-one could ever pin on the ALP in Victoria any association with the Communist Party and it did nol do the Party any damage at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But how can the Labor Party possibly justify its association with this motley collection of no-hopers who have assembled to establish or set on foot this Moratorium, which is a miserable imitation of what has been already organised in the United States of America, and, having damaged its reputation, proceed to an <span class="highlight">election</span> and ask the people to vote for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government made it clear that wild horses would not drag from it prior lo the <span class="highlight">election</span> a declaration of its intention on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span> was over the Government announced its intention, but that announcement was made prior to the sittings of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, having evaded the issue before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government took action before Parliament met and indicated that in this particular case the Executive proposed to arrogate to itself a power which 1 believe it has no right to possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Urging that the embargo question should not be allowed to become an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue,  Mr McEwen  promised that the Government would not act to remove the embargo until an adequate opportunity was given to opponents of the move to place their views before the Australian Wool Industry Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember what  Mr McEwen  said after the Gwydir by-<span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then  Mr Anthony,  his  Deputy  Leader and the Minister for Primary Industry, decided that the time was ripe to lift the embargo as another 3 years would elapse before the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How could we have any confidence in anybody who could stand in this place heralding Chowilla and even fight an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this great issue and the great benefits to South Australia to result from the building of Chowilla and who could now 7 years later say that Chowilla is no good at all unless we have a dam upstream and that when we do we will consider the rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700421_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A consequence of such an <span class="highlight">election</span> will, however, be that the shares will be valued on an assets backing basis for all duty purposes, including the valuation of the property in the estate and the assessment of duty in accordance with this valuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In requiring that shares which are the subject of an <span class="highlight">election</span> be valued by reference to their assets backing value, the objective of the Bill is to place estates of shareholders in family companies in a position that broadly corresponds with the situation which would have existed if the property represented by the shares had been owned by the deceased persons themselves instead of by their companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in 1968 and although Labor received a majority of votes it did not form the Government and the Hall Government reversed the instructions given to South Australia’s representative on the River Murray Commission and agreed to the proposal for the building of the Dartmouth Dam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is obvious that this question will be debated in the South Austraiian Parliament next week and, from what we know, it is very likely that an <span class="highlight">election</span> will follow closely upon the parliamentary debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can well recall the electoral campaign for the seat of Denison in Hobart, in which I was the campaign director for the Australian Labor Party candidate, Neil Batt, and during the course of the 14 months prior to that <span class="highlight">election</span> I knocked on no fewer than 3,500 doors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700422_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Labor Party cannot win an <span class="highlight">election</span> it claims that the <span class="highlight">election</span> is crooked and the electorate has been gerrymandered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, some of the features of the Bill are included only because the Government is giving lip service to a promise it made prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700505_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But on this occasion, because the Moratorium is to take place and 2 State elections and a Federal by-<span class="highlight">election</span> are pending the whole question of foreign policy is thrown into the political arena. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When other methods have failed, an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, unless it is fought on that issue, is not a basis for deciding whether the people have given a mandate on that 1 issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should not be encouraged by the knowledge that it owes its position to, and is in power today only by virtue of, the fact that in sufficient marginal seats to give it a majority at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> it was fortunate in having candidates whose names appeared higher on the alphabetical list than did those of Labor Party candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Government supporters had the intestinal fortitude to face the people of this country in an <span class="highlight">election</span> tomorrow the Government would be defeated on this one issue alone because Australians are completely fed up with the Government’s attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make no apology for observing that the idea of a homes savings grant was taken from an undertaking made by the Australian Labor Party at the time of an <span class="highlight">election</span> to assist young people to purchase land and erect homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>SoI do not altogether agree with the basis upon which  Senator Byrne  put it, namely, that the DLP should have an <span class="highlight">election</span> as to which matter should proceed in the sense that if he were to put on a dozen matters tomorrow the DLP would monopolise the General Business period for the time necessary to discuss them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not know what comments he is prepared to make, in the midst of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, about the Commonwealth’s recent action in increasing interest rates, but if his argument was sound in February of this year., when he and the other 6 Premiers put before the Commonwealth what they considered to be an unanswerable case regarding the financial state into which they had fallen, then it is sound today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700507_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one who has some political nouse and is able to tell how elections generally will go, let me say to honourable senators opposite that they are the best people in the world to keep themselves out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party did well at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, not because of the Labor Party but because of silly business in our own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The average Australian has strength of character and loyalty, and if he feels that any Party or any group will shoot our own boys in the back - whether by disloyal actions or the attitudes which have been expressed in recent times - he wilt ensure that that Party will be given the right answer at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700512_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> I took up with the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Sinclair)  a matter concerning problems which fishermen on the north coast of New South Wales were facing, with the destruction of valuable nets and equipment by trading vessels hugging the coast in their movements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government itself has talked at <span class="highlight">election</span> time and under pressure about a reduction in taxation in different areas for the living - not necessarily for the dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After what happened on 7 th May, if the Australian Labor Party has not dug its grave so far as any chance of winning an <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country in the near future is concerned then there is something wrong with the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700514_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his policy speech during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  again referred to the necessity for a rescheduling of the taxation scale to reduce the income tax burden on the lower and middle income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700519_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commonwealth, in fact, is carrying the burden of insurance of these low income people, very much in conformity with the policy enunciated by the Labor movement at the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, namely, the policy of universal coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that the time is ripe for this Government to look at the proposal of universality which was so adequately put forward by the Labor movement at the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On other Bills of minor importance we have 20 speakers when we are on the air, but today no-one on the Government side wants to speak because the Government wants to rush the Bill through and get it settled before some <span class="highlight">election</span> or other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the policy speech of our Prime Minister,  Mr John  Gorton, during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign for the House of Representatives it was announced that there would be a new approach towards widening and improving the national health scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, this scheme was conceived in panic when it was put to the Australian people during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is a very important occasion when we debate it in this chamber for this legislation is to carry out the promise made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  in his policy speech before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to speak much more fully to the amendment moved by the Democratic Labor Party but in these last 2 minutes I want to stress that I believe that in this Bill we have legislation which is of the utmost benefit to the people of Australia, legislation which is carrying out one more promise made by the Prime Minister during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instructions were given in May 1969, with reminders going to the draftsmen in August and again in October - during, our Budget session, I remind honourable senator - and it proved impossible for the draftsmen to formulate the regulations before we rose last year, earlier than usual, for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But assume that such a document were published again by one of the health funds just prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, as the Opposition sees it the phrase ‘relating to health’ would enable the Minister to say that the document related to health and that therefore he intended to use the taxpayers’ money to inform people that the Government supported the document which had been issued by the health fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700521_senate_27_s44/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that the Government assisted members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party when they appealed to the Court of Disputed Returns against the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Senator McClelland  to this chamber, but the Government did not see fit to assist the Tramway Association when it had to go to the High Court to defend the decision of those whom the Commonwealth itself has appointed to the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have seen this Government, after narrowly surviving the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held last year, call Parliament together to sit for1 day only last year after which we were passed into the hands of Divine Providence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not say he was elected by the members of the Union because, as I understand the position, a fraction of the members of certain unions vote in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of office bearers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government should endeavour to achieve something like compulsory voting in union elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not wish to be offensive or provocative, but the fact is that after an <span class="highlight">election</span> there may be a change in the number of senators in the second nongovernment party in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It could happen that the committees would have a membership in the proportion of 6 to I, or 5 to 2, or in the event of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, there would be changes in that proportion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hear many of these promises on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he forgets that, whether it be despite those statements or because of them, at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor movement won a considerable number of seats from the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let the Minister answer this question: To whom have the farmers come with their problems since the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is convenient to say it now but I challenge them to come out in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and say what they are going to do for the primary industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the people who look after their interests, who provide money with which to fight <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, may be affected by such a policy, and as a consequence honourable senators opposite will not introduce the policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700819_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-121-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It might be said that a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is pending and that other matters are being attended to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is pending or whether we are in recess, all these things can be begun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This cry was kept up for 2 long years until about 3 weeks before the 1963 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> when the Government undertook that if it were re-elected it would make money available to the States for flood mitigation work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the course of his remarks  Senator Byrne  read to us the 1967 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech of his Party wherein, from recollection, he said it was proposed that a secretariat- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second fundamental that I lay down for myself in this matter is this: If the House of Government, which is the House of Representatives, has obtained an electoral mandate as a result of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, it is entitled to send legislation based on its electoral mandate into the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He pointed out that during the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Democratic Labor Party had suggested that there should be a national organisation dealing with this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what he said in the 1967 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their promise did not matter because the <span class="highlight">election</span> was over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We come along here now when there is to be another <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of the year and it is very embarrassing for them because here is a proposal to have an inquiry by the Senate into the same subject matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope the honourable senator will go out and tell those primary producers that during the campaign prior to the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700825_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a convenient time to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> now for the House of Representatives, even with only the normal half of the Senate due for <span class="highlight">election</span> before July next, would bring the 2 Houses back into a gear and avoid the burden of so many Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that both the Leader of the Opposition in this place and the Leader of the Opposition in another place have used the word ‘<span class="highlight">election</span>’ very much in their replies to the Budget, and therefore the moment of Budget reply must be for them a high moment of opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a reduction has, therefore, more than made good the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to deal promptly and effectively with this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government promised at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that it would reduce the burden of income tax on the middle and lower income groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 have said many times in this place that the Australian public should never start to put pressures on this Government at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, because when the Government makes <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in the heat and the atmosphere of an <span class="highlight">election</span> they invariably have tragic results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to purchase the Fill aircraft was not a defence proposal but an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His promise first saw the light of day in his policy speech in an <span class="highlight">election</span> atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The genius of the Liberal Party - if one looks back over nearly 21 years of this - is that it can go out on the <span class="highlight">election</span> platform and talk about great prosperity and the affluent society in which we live, but it can also intervene in the national wage case every year and keep wages down to a shameful level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the comments which one hears everywhere one turns, 1 think that the Government would learn a lesson from the people, from its masters, if it were to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Devitt  entirely overlooked the fact that a lot less than 12 months ago we went through the very expensive procedure of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Regardless of the time that normally expires between elections, the cost of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and the disruption in the administration of the country which an <span class="highlight">election</span> brings because of the engagement of people in <span class="highlight">election</span> matters rather than in running the country, he blithely says: ‘Let us have an <span class="highlight">election</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700826_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition that the new arrangement will not come into operation until October indicates to me that we will have very little experience of it before the Senate rises for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I agree with  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack that prior to the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> it will be necessary to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday- and Friday of one week and then sit on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the following week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700827_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A very important issue raised just after the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> was held was that of health reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How often since the last <span class="highlight">election</span> has there been an interim award - for want of a better term - so that doctors can classify another complaint as being in the intermediate class? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another point which I made earlier that 1 wish to repeat is that whatever the Government may feel about the policy that the Australian Labor Party espoused at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> of a flat li per cent tax on incomes to provide a health coverage from the cradle to the grave it is a better proposal than the intermittent scheme which the Government has introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the Government will be censured severely by the people of Australia at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious that  Senator Greenwood  has a very short memory because a matter of 500 or 600 votes in a few seats - no more than  A  - throughout Australia on the occasion of the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> determined whether the Labor Party would govern in its own right or the coalition would be returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer’s airy statement that the Government has made more than good its promise to the Australian community before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> means nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that the message contained in the Prime Minister’s words prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> should be followed - and 1 believe that this Government is attempting to do this - and that is that those people who of their own accord attempt to provide for themselves will be the ones within the community who are encouraged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700901_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him: Does he think that the Government is enhancing Australia’s prestige by stopping one person from coming here, irrespective of whether this person wants to speak at a meeting which is being held to protest against the declared policy of the Government and which has the support, one may say from the votes cast in the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>, of practically half the population of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems likely that the Australian C0at of arms, in addition to having the kangaroo and the emu on it, will have a cricket bat added to it if the Government is successful in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, or in a general <span class="highlight">election</span> if one is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With reference to the 1970 Budget, this meeting of Queensland teachers deplores the callous disregard of the needs of education at the  pretertiary  level and the failure to acknowledge in the Budget the undertaking given by the Prime Minister in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy that this Government would give consideration to the survey of the needs of State education over the next 5 years, made by the Australian Education Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite reduced taxes on ‘lower and middle incomes’ in accordance with the Government’s pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise and even before the application of such reductions, it has imposed such severe indirect taxation that the alleged benefits are reduced to nothing; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government allowed this nation’s health scheme to get completely out of hand until the weight of numbers in the ballot box at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> forced it to stop proclaiming to the nation and to the world that Australia had the best health service in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It attempts to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> because in the view of its veteran former leader, members of the Labor Party have been overcome by the starry eyed glittering of the ministerial benches which face them on the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have thought up this law and order campaign for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only thing that worries me is that Government supporters are prepared to belittle the name of Australia in the councils abroad for the sake of creating an atmosphere for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for some reason, perhaps because there seems to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the offing and because the Government has nothing else in its own mind that will secure its position it wants to wave a flag and persuade the people that if this person comes here law and order will be destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having said that, I know that  Senator Douglas  Scott expects me to say that the Australian Labor Party will be trying to take his seat away from him at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Government supporters are talking now about law and order as they seem to do on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>House of Representatives, the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns),  who immediately prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> said: ‘I have no confidence in the Prime Minister of Australia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the parties put forward their proposals for the following 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> an overwhelming number of voters endorsed the proposals put forward by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy is brought out only as a carrot offered to the people at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the previous occasion an <span class="highlight">election</span> was coming up and the Government said: ‘Now we have a tapered means test*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that such a defeat would have meant a general <span class="highlight">election</span> with perhaps a double dissolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I must be sidetracked momentarily bv honourable senators opposite,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  I would say that I believe the time is near when every ballot for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a union official and particularly every vote as to whether to go on strike will have to be conducted by officials in secret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of  Senator Rae  I might say that  Mr Leedman,  the leader of the Liberal Party whose team was so soundly defeated in the Advisory Council <span class="highlight">election</span> only a few days ago, said that one of the main reasons for the defeat was that the Government and the Minister were worried about the appearance of Canberra and not worried about the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been no child endowment increase since 1967 - prior to the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> - and the previous increase was in 1964, which also was a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This year being a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> year, I hope that we will again see an increase in child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This system is so obnoxious that it must be humiliating to the recipients of social service benefits to have their income debated from the hustings every <span class="highlight">election</span> time and a bidding process engaged in, with one candidate saying: ff we are elected we will give you so much’ and the other fellow saying: ‘If we are elected we will give you more.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not matter if there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> every week; the principle does not change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October 1969 the Government fought an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the clear promise that, over a period of 3 years, it would give taxation relief in an amount of $200m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Only in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>  Mr Whitlam  was saying that he too would offer tax relief and people could be assured that the Labor Party would be more generous with its tax relief than the Government would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>has been of great concern to the Democratic Labor Party, particularly as we all know during the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year, namely, the suggested welcomed accommodation to the Russian naval presence in the Indian Ocean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor government will ensure the introduction of a contributory national superannuation system and the elimination of the means lest, as is proposed in my amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When an <span class="highlight">election</span> was pending - I referred to this the other night - in came the tapered means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the honourable senator know it is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not indicated, to my knowledge anyhow, whether the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be this year or any other year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The position is not the same for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> as it would be for a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Soon after my <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate I moved a similar amendment on 30th September 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such an approach condemns pensioners to perpetual acceptance of the crumbs handed out at Budget or <span class="highlight">election</span> time by governments, irrespective of their political colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes I feel that both the major political parties want to retain pensions in the political field as a means of attracting support at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, when they might use them as a carrot for the less thinking section of our people, particularly the aged and the sick who are desperately in need of additional funds and will vote irrespective of what other policy items might be on the platform or in the policy speeches of the respective leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is a matter in relation to which the people should have the opportunity to exercise their will over the Parliament, and they have that opportunity through the ballot box at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General ascertain from the Australian Broadcasting Commission why  Mr Whitlam  was permitted, in effect, to open his Party’s Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in the weekend of 19th-20th September on the programme Four Corners’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does this piece of political bias herald discrimination against the DLP similar to that which occurred at the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> when 4 leaders of opposing parlies were invited by the ABC to take part in a ‘Four Corners’ broadcast just before the <span class="highlight">election</span> to attack the DLP, and the DLP was given no opportunity to reply? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will read  Senator Cole’s  amendment, because we hear a lot about this around <span class="highlight">election</span> time, and these things get turned about a fair bit.I know that the accusation is always made: ‘The Labor Party and the Liberal Party voted against an increase in pensions or automatic adjustment’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Marriott  touched on this aspect when he said that we had seen carried out a promise  -  I believe made recklessly during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- - by the Prime Minister to reduce taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite the honourable senator to see what sort of rise in pensions is given on the eve of the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives and to compare it with the rise given in this Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we give away our right tonight as easily as it appears it will be given away I can see a procedure being adopted in this place until the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, if there is one this year, whereby no more general business sessions will be held because while we are sitting as a series of committees and not as the Senate we will always be faced with this urgency of legislation coming from another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has not used ils last <span class="highlight">election</span> bait to the degree of compensating those who probably are not greatly affected, because many of them, generally speaking, would be able to continue in fairly normal employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister for Air tell us whether it is intended in the ordinary application of the rules relating to the use of VIP aircraft that Senate Ministers should be able to use VIP aircraft during the coming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and that that right would be denied to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, as well as to the Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and perhaps his Deputy Leader? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he also tell us where the rationale lies in an approach that the Government should authorise a set of rules permitting that course to bc followed for its own Ministers in <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigning while refusing equal rights to the Opposition? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>by leave - In the short break that we will have I wonder whether the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  will ascertain whether the rather early date on which the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held, namely 21st November, will affect in any way the sittings of the Parliament As is known, the House of Representatives, which dominates us a fair bit as to our sitting days, will rise on 13th November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I am disappointed that we go to yet another <span class="highlight">election</span> without the voting age in Australia having been lowered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently we cannot see something which is obvious and we allow the present system to continue for yet another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other thing which disappoints me is that this Government has failed to take its courage into its hands and bring together again the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good for any government to have to shape its policies towards an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and it is not good for the Australian people to be going to the polling booths just about every second Saturday afternoon to vote in one <span class="highlight">election</span> or another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the next time an announcement is made about an <span class="highlight">election</span> both the question of giving the vote to our youth, and the question of bringing the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives together again, will be in the forefront of the Government’s mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> has been announced will the Minister ask the Broadcasting Control Board to regard this matter as one of urgency and arrange to have the new standards presented to the Parliament before it adjourns for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> - preferably before the estimates for the PostmasterGeneral’s Department are debated in this place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - When I informed the Senate on 1st October that the Government proposed that the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> should be held on Saturday, 21st November 1970, I undertook to give full details of the timetable when replies had been received from the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the general cause for alarm, will he make a ministerial statement on these very vital matters, for the benefit of home owners in the area, so that it can be debated before the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Is there any truth in the report which appeared in last weekend’s ‘Sunday Telegraph’ that the new or second international airport planned for Sydney may be scrapped and that the Government may keep secret a report which has been prepared on a proposed second international airport until after the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, will the Minister assure the Parliament that the contents of this report will be announced before the Senate rises for the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701013_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was here just before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1967, and I think he was one of those who voted to pass the off-shore petroleum legislation which gave away resources of the people, which were in the custody of the Commonwealth Government, which amounted, according to estimates which have never been denied - in fact, they have been confirmed - to hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sense of social injustice was so great that the Government was moved before an <span class="highlight">election</span> to promise some decreases in the rate of income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to tell the Opposition this: We are going to fight this <span class="highlight">election</span> as I think the Australian people expect it to be fought, both in relation to the Government and to the Opposition, and that is on the question of the acceptance and discharge of public and parliamentary responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is to cost about  $3  1m a year, but $50m can be grabbed out of the air at any time to try lo buy an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If it achieves nothing more than bringing the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Senate and the House of Representatives together it will have achieved something indeed, lt will put the policies of all parties completely to the test at the right time; that is at a time when so much dissatisfaction is found in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-49-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will say so for the next 5 weeks until the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign is over and I will continue to say it afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anybody who is trying to produce a situation in which there is a lower informal vote in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is doing something very useful for the Australian people, the Senate and the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People who have built up an industry from nothing, who have had to fight to gain recognition not only in this country but throughout the world, are being hampered by the actions of a government which made a promise in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to decrease income tax and which has had to find a way out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701016_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether it is a fact that in Government policy speeches prior to the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> it was stated by Government leaders that it would be an objective of the Government to assist rural municipalities financially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701020_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Further will the Minister give an assurance that after the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> no credit squeeze will be brought about by the banks or by the introduction of a supplementary budget because the economy has been affected by the loss of the $90m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am certain that the farmers will deal with the Country Party as it richly deserves to be treated at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> following that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether crocodile tears are being shed or whether the nearness of the <span class="highlight">election</span> sponsored this proposal, but I am amazed that the Australian Labor Party, after declaring that it proposed to help the Government to kill the Democratic Labor Party’s proposal for a survey into the whole rural field, now states that because that proposal was not carried we ought to adopt some kind of alternative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea is that it will not come on before the Senate rises for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party will be able to hide away, dumping the rural industries as usual, not allowing this matter to be debated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senate standing committee - one of the new committees - is merely a means at this stage of political time, on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, to steal the thunder of the Democratic Labor Party and to try to capitalise on the heat which has been generated by the resentment of primary producers at the inactivity in respect of legislation and administration in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest thai to add to the labours of one committee of the Senate an inquiry into the problems of the dairying industry and the wool industry - a device which apparently commends itself to the Australian Labor Party - would be to put these problems into cold storage in order that au <span class="highlight">election</span> can be held on purely political matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means in effect that we will go to the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and will wait until next February before anything whatever is done for the rural industries, either by way of debate or by way of action, which is far more important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope he will forgive me for saying that the proposal which was put forward by the Labor Party today was put forward with the imminent Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the substantial relief, to use the Treasurer’s term, that the Prime Minister  (Mr  Gorton)  undertook in his policy speech before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> to give to the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ministers of this Government  have  not shown  very  great interest  in  this or  any  other debate since the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> date was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In his policy speech last year during a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the Prime Minister agreed to reduce taxation by $200m over a period of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701021_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are prepared to come back next week, which was not arranged, so that the Government can carry out its business and so that we can go to the country for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognising the amount of Government business which is before the Senate and the the pressure on the Senate to complete this business in time to conduct a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, my colleagues and I on the Government side of the chamber have worked on the basis that we will not speak in a debate unless there is a need to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps at this stage I could indicate that the ordinance arose out of a statement made  by  the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on 13th May last at Canberra during the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign for a seat in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The statement was made, as I understand it, at an <span class="highlight">election</span> meeting at which the Liberal Party candidate on that occasion was in attendance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we now know, and as history records, the candidate who would have been espousing that policy was not successful in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder even whether the sudden concern could be of a somewhat fleeting character and perhaps could be prompted by concern with the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year it was increased by 50 per cent, and that was not a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously the heat is building up as we get closer to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the farmers’ problems today 1 know that the Labor Party thinks it may be able to pick up a few votes at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> next month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague,  Senator Drake-Brockman,  has informed me, no <span class="highlight">election</span> was to be held then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held this year the Australian Labor Party is showing a new-found interest in the problems of the rural industries of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701022_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 6 years we have been muddling and waffling along with this project trying to cover up for the great mistake which was made by buying a pig in a poke for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In speaking on the Budget papers I expressed the view that I believed that the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  in giving effect to promises he made prior to the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> 12 months ago, and in response to the campaign carried out by many big unions for tax reduction on the lower and middle range of incomes, had exceeded what I would have expected in his taxation remissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had not intended to intervene at this stage, but I would like to point out that one of the main reasons why the Australian Labor Party sought to do exactly what  Senator Gair  has said - reject the Budget - was because we wanted to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> based on the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is seeking to take something out of the pint pot, because this Bill is to carry out more in toto than was promised as taxation concessions by the Prime’ Minister  (Mr Gorton)  during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign.I was at a loss for a while to understand why more is to be given tothe Australian taxpayers than the Prime Minister indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the debate on the Budget I and several of my colleagues pointed out that one of the worst forms of promise is one made during the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very clearly Treasury had not been consulted at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> promise was made without any research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole of this regressive system of taxation has been exposed and highlighted through the combination of a hasty deci sion made during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and a system of taxation which operates so that the people who are best off in the community will receive the greatest taxation concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubts that had this amelioration of taxation come about in the normal manner the Government would have done precisely what was in the mind of the Prime Minister when he made his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might even cost less, because it might be possible to get back to the figure originally suggested by the Prime Minister during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This measure will serve as a warning to the people of Australia to distrust promises made during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, lt is not possible to do business like that any more in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701026_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is not an easy matter and I cannot deal with it until after the coming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> because it will take up a lot of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General find out and inform the Senate whether, if the leader of a Federal parliamentary party delivers his opening <span class="highlight">election</span> speech on an evening when Parliament is sitting, the broadcast of that speech by the Australian Broadcasting Commission will interfere with the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now ask the Minister whether the delay in replying to my question has been caused by the fact that senior officers of the Department of Trade and Industry have been directed to carry out research for the Government’s Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, or whether it is a fact that no figures are kept of trade between Australia and mainland China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The gun has been fired, as it were, for this <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, lt is getting close to hypocrisy for the Australian Labor Party to say to honourable senators on this side of the House that we are trying to stifle debate, to cut down on the sitting hours and times of this Parliament and to hurry through legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe, firstly, because we have not said we will not sit next week and, secondly, because the Leader of the Opposition in another place  (Mr Whitlam)  is starting the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign tomorrow that we should support this motion, get on with the business and hope that we can finish properly and decently within the hours set out or return to work next week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 have received impetus from the rumours circulating that the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  proposes to include in his campaign speech for the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> a statement that certain concessions will be granted in the field of social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that one could probably describe the document as advance propaganda for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Advertisements appear in Australian news papers today stating that a parliamentary Party leader will have his Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign policy speech broadcast over all Australian Broadcasting Commission stations tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This motion would have had a lot more validity, if it had any at all, if it were not introduced in the atmosphere of a coming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and if the Senate were not 3 or 4 days away from the time of lifting, perhaps - who knows - but 12 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party has used, obviously for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes, a vehicle by which it can give vent to a number of thoughts which have been plaguing it for the last few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the <span class="highlight">election</span> held last June, I think, in Great Britain the Labour Government which had advocated a prices and income policy was destroyed by the trade union movement because it refused to accept that policy, in spite of the pleadings of  Mr Harold  Wilson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  - the  Deputy  Prime Minister elect, if I may put it that way; I suggest he will be the  Deputy  Prime Minister if Australia is unfortunate enough to have another LiberalCountry Party Government after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> - has been telling the dairying industry that it has to cut back production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not happen under ordinary circumstances, apart from the fact that a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>  is  almost on our doorstep, because the Whip of the Australian Democratic Labor Party said the other night: Oh, you are not going to bring them all back in here, are you?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the things that concerns me is that this year we are having a very short Budget session because of the approaching Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Next year we will have a clear run, without elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The following year the Budget session will again be short because a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> will be conducted in that year if the Government survives for that length of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The difficulty will arise again in 1973 because another Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held in that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-36-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all are conscious of the fact that a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on 21st November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Personally I feel that if we have not disposed of the business of the Senate by Friday night the Senate should adjourn until after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have not completed it by Friday night, I submit that the Senate should adjourn until after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether we meet next week or whether we follow  Senator Gair’s  suggestion and meet after the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> lies with the Government which has the right to submit to the Senate the times of meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we should at least follow it up by deciding immediately whether we will meet after the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Gair  that the Government now wants to take away certain of our rights, lt fixed 21st November as the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, lt could easily have fixed 5th December or 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In past years elections have been held on those dates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> could be held next April, as the honourable senator said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The writs do not have to be returned until the end of next June, lt is.no excuse to say that, because an <span class="highlight">election</span> has been fixed for a certain date, our rights must be taken away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people who are now wanting to take away our rights -were those who fixed the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> as 21st November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I arn wondering .whether we are making a serious attempt to conclude the sitting of the Senate for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign because, even though we are all in favour of measures such as the Loan (Housing) Bill, honourable senators talk about completely unrelated matters which happen to be in a field similar to that in which the Bill operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701029_senate_27_s46_c1/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen Press reports that  Mr Whitlam  did not raise the question of a 35-hour week when delivering the Australian Labor Party policy speech for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy of the Government to increase the amount of Commonwealth assistance to educational research in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is only because there is a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in the offing that the Government comes in with some measure of support for the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sands of time are running out for Vietnam and Australia’s external affairs policy; another <span class="highlight">election</span> issue has to be found. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It delayed action until the eve of the completion of .h:s session of the Parliament and just prior to a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time when the industry has reached such a critical state, when the price of wool is lower than it has been at any time in the last 25 years, when costs and prices are at a record level, when the employment situation in rural areas is in a severe position and after a series of protest meetings have been held throughout many rural areas in Australia, particularly in New South Wales, after the farmers have marched in Adelaide and in Melbourne, and in the dying hours of this session of the Parliament and, perhaps more importantly from the Government’s point of view just prior to a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> being held, the Government has decided to introduce legislation to establish the Australian Wool Commission, which will consist of a chairman, 2 members representing the wool growers, 1 member representing the Commonwealth Government and 3 other members, all of whom shall be appointed by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>He mentioned that there should be a statutory authority with a majority of wool grower control, but he did not say whether big and small growers would have an equal say in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of growers’ representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we hear this tripe being talked today about various sections, including the Government, passing the buck for so long, we know that the comment is entirely wrong and that it is purely a political comment made at a time of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> when certain people in a Party are looking for political mileage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been much criticism to the effect that the Government has rushed in this legislation because we are to have a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So let us not start talking this nonsense about these things being thought of only in the last week and having suddenly come into the Parliament today just before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say the Government rushed this measure in because there is to be a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point we have been making all along is that the government has waited until the last possible moment before a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to introduce this legislation, whereas it could have done so at any time during the period since 1959, when recommendations were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been blamed for doing nothing until this time, lt was suggested that it has taken this action only because a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have been told that we have introduced this legislation because a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision, together with the Crawford report, was considered and accepted by the Wool Industry Conference on 14th October, and last Tuesday this Bill was introduced into the Parliament That is the background to this Bill which the Opposition claims the Government has introduced in a hurry in an attempt to gain some votes at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister guarantee that a reply will be furnished before the Senate goes into recess for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware that the Government is endeavouring to make the 35-hour week a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> issue? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyway, he will not be successful at the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, we will be in such great number on the benches opposite that perhaps the need will not arise to use these 4 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honorable senator believes in such a proposal he should go out and advocate it at the <span class="highlight">election</span>, but that is another story and I do not want to be provocative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the machinations and problems of the Australian Labor Party, well, I do not wish lo reflect upon those beyond saying that people are entitled to draw their own inference from the fact that the day after the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> has been picked for the decision on a certain matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once the Senate rises and the <span class="highlight">election</span> is over one will obviously get more time to deal with the administration of the Department of Civil Aviation and I shall be taking it up again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Government going to go on from year to year, from <span class="highlight">election</span> to <span class="highlight">election</span>, doling out some kind of electoral bribe that it thinks will satisfy this section or that section of the community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between January 1969, the first time that the committee sat, and the end of last October - everyone will remember that that was the time of the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> - the committee had met on only 3 occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government received a jolt at the general <span class="highlight">election</span> some 12 months ago and apparently the committee got down to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, rumour has it that Towra Point, which the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  said in April 1969 - some 4 or 5 months before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> - was out of consideration by the airport siting committee has now come back into the area of possibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I pledge that the Australian Labor Party when elected to office - which will be at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> - led by  Mr Whitlam  will repeal the excise on the wine industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is reasonable to have suspicion that this may be an attempt to preserve a young Minister facing his first Estimates debate in that capacity, who has the important responsibility of control of the Army estimates and who has to present himself to the public in a fortnight’s time to contest the <span class="highlight">election</span> in a doubtful situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge the Government to take heed of my remarks and, certainly before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, to bring down recommendations regarding Australian content in television programmes because I believe that Australians engaged in this vital communications industry have not been given a fair go to date by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of these amendments will be to give to the Council of the Canberra College of Advanced Education the same sort of status as is at present given to the Council of the Australian National University by allowing for representation of both Houses of the national Parliament, on the governing body of the College: to make provision for the representation of the citizens of Canberra, by <span class="highlight">election</span>, on the Council of the College; and also to make some minor provisions relating to the prescribing of regulations by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He knew there had been Federal Cabinet discussion on the matter and that the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  had made ‘a good deal of remarks’ on what had happened at the <span class="highlight">election</span> 3 weeks before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps a reason could be that South Australia had the audacity to elect a Labor Party Government in May this year, or perhaps, because the Federal members from the Government parties were annihilated at the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">election</span> held last year, the Gorton Government is going to take it out on South Australia and deprive our State of this vital industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that address, preparatory for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Prime Minister dealt extensively with rural industries - I thought rather ineffectively because in my opinion he did not offer any worthwhile suggestions or remedies for the difficulties the rural industries face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that 1 am developing mastoids from the earbashing that I have had, on many innocuous matters, from people who have been practising for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign or who have introduced political propaganda into a session the primary purpose of which is to dispose of Bills that have come here from the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that in Government policy speeches made prior to the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives it was stated by leaders that it would be an objective of Government to financially assist rural municiplaities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:  fi) On 9th October 1969 the Minister foi Trade and Industry, in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech as leader of the Australian Country Party, said: it is now a policy objective of the Country Party that Commonwealth funds should be made available, through the State Governments, as a contribution to the costs in the smaller centres of population, of such amenities as swimming pools, child-care centres, civic centres and showgrounds, playing fields and the like.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That changed position is due, of course, to an increase in the number of DLP senators since the recent Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who cares to peruse or read the speeches I have made since my <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate and those of my colleagues will observe the continuing interest and concern that we have had for pensioners and those unable 10 obtain a pension because of the iniquitous means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year, in connection with the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, I read with interest what  Senator Gair  was reported as saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would not be a bad idea if the tremendous mineral resources of this country were utilised for the benefit of the people, as has been done in other countries such as Italy and Libya where they are making a great deal out of those resources, instead of their being handed over for a pittance, as ours were by this Government, in the legis lation which was raced through just before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> before last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The DLP should not criticise measures for which it voted, ft not only voted for the measures but also supported the Government at the <span class="highlight">election</span> by means of its preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This rebate was granted because of a rash <span class="highlight">election</span> promise which the Government wanted to honour quickly It did not give the Taxation Office time to work out a proper curve and the 10 per cent flat rate of rebate was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why the rebate granted totalled more than what the Government had promised prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710216_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-97-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has it been clearly and finally decided that this Parliament, when it permits the broadcasting of its proceedings, is not in contravention of an Act of the Parliament which prohibits the televising and broadcasting of political matter after midnight on the Wednesday preceding a Federal or State <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held on a Saturday? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally we are aware that the provision is that during the currency of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign political matters shall nol be broadcast after midnight on the Wednesday preceding a Saturday on which an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interpretation of that provision depends upon the <span class="highlight">election</span> and what political matter is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same situation applies to pensions, T believe they should be tied to the inflationary situation so that increases are automatic instead of the pensioners having to go to the Government which may be either looking towards an <span class="highlight">election</span>, coping with a lime of depression or simply trying to avoid the problem for some other reason that is best known to itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the worst <span class="highlight">election</span> result was that of the 1 948 prices referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the meantime there was an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until the <span class="highlight">election</span> was over nothing was done to meet the wishes of those in the industry who. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise by Labor in 1929 lo stop these exports caused some panic buying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eleven years ago - on 31st May 1960-1  had  the privilege of moving an amendment In this chamber to the Broadcasting and Television Bill that was designed to provide a qualified privilege to commercial licensees during an <span class="highlight">election</span> period in respect  of  the broadcasting of political matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides that  if  a licensee sells time on his commercial station  to  one political party he must supply the same amount of time at the same price to any other political party which is represented in the Parliament for which the <span class="highlight">election</span> is being held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Hannan  early in his speech made the interesting statement that if a radio station broadcasts <span class="highlight">election</span> material for one Party it is required to give equal time to anybody else who requests it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My reading of the Act suggests that all radio stations which broadcast <span class="highlight">election</span> material must give reasonable time to the other parties represented in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government merely exists, as I have said from time to time, not because of its virtues or the strength of its policies but .because of the support that it receives at every <span class="highlight">election</span> from the Democratic Labor Party although it sneers at thai Parly from lime to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Excuse me,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  but I must make this point: If our preferences had been given to the Australia Party in New South Wales the result of that <span class="highlight">election</span> would have been exactly the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I were one of the great vested interests in this country which was determined not to see the Australian Labor Party in power and I were faced with the decision of where to make a donation to a political party prior to the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> I would not make it to the Australian Country Party because it was so discredited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710223_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one of my colleagues says, under oath, lt seems that  Senator Hannan  will go to any lengths to submit a case, as long as he thinks it will please those nice young ladies or elderly ladies who have the right to select the first second and third Government candidates for the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710224_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If further definition is wanted I suggest that it will be in the minds of the students of the University to whom the right of <span class="highlight">election</span> is given because they have the authority to elect the person from among their number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that during the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in November 1970 the Minister for External Territories stated at a public meeting on the Gold Coast, Queensland, that he was not perturbed at the loss of the Chinese market for Australian wheat as in any case we were disposing of only our inferior wheat to that country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is there any similarity between the rejection of votes for the electorate of Campbelltown in the New South Wales Slate <span class="highlight">election</span>, where a number of ballot-papers were ruled informal because they were initialled by the Returning Officer on the front instead of the back, and’ the ruling given under the Commonwealth Electoral Act in the 1969 House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in respect of absentee votes which recorded a first preference for  Mr W.

    <p>Is political censorship carried out, at the Minister’s direction, in respect of school student newspapers such as the Tweed River High School publication, which, during a recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, published an article by the Australian Labor Party candidate that was subsequently censored? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the evidence of continuing inflation provided by the consumer price index figures for the March quarter and of the Prime Minister’s failure to enunciate any policies to cope with the problem, does the Minister agree that we are entitled to assume either that the Prime Minister intends to inflate his way through an early <span class="highlight">election</span> or that his reputation as a Treasurer was grossly inflated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONAll T can say to the honourable senator in relation to the political side of his question - it is clearly political - is that if the Prime Minister chooses to have an early <span class="highlight">election</span> the consequences for the Labor Party will be disastrous, particularly against the background of the situation today when the Labor Party no longer has the control of the great trade union movement which has been the backbone of its political life for the last 50 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Democratic Labor Party has claimed at <span class="highlight">election</span> times to be a Party of responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the people on my left, who talk so glibly at the present time about what they want to see done, proudly claim that they were the people who were responsible for Labor’s defeat at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have stood for that at every <span class="highlight">election</span> over a period of time in which the Democratic Labor Party has been responsible for keeping Labor out of government and robbing the people of the benefits about which it is talking so glibly at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On innumerable occasions the Australian Labor Party has put forward proposals to increase child endowment, but the DLP has supported the Liberal Party and the Country Party at <span class="highlight">election</span> times and has thus denied to the Australian Labor Party an opportunity to give effect to what the DLP now says should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The parents of Australian children should be made aware of the Government’s lack of interest in this direction and should realise that if, unhappily, the Government is returned at the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>, whether it is in 1971 or 1972, it will be the fate of child endowment payments to remain at their present stagnated level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-55-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONI understand that under the Public Service Act the practice is for staff to resign at least 1 month before the date on which nominations for the <span class="highlight">election</span> close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the agreement decided upon at the National Labour Advisory Council meeting last week on the payment of union fines under outdated legislation, and subsequently supported by the  Chairman  of ARC Industries Ltd, will the Ministers involved announce their acceptance of this agreement and not continue with an attitude which could provoke a national strike to secure a political advantage and which could create the atmosphere for an early <span class="highlight">election</span> before the Government may or will have to introduce more stringent credit restrictions and controls? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter was brought to a head by a decision of the Government which was reported on 5th May 1970 as a consequence of an <span class="highlight">election</span> meeting which was held to fill the vacant seat in the Australian Capita] Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was only in the course of an address at an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Prime Minister said that as from 1st January 1971 the basis of the land tenure system of the Australian Capital Territory would be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Principally those problems arose because of the ineffectiveness of the Government in meeting a situation which did not arise in 1970 during a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> campaign for the seat of Canberra but which have existed in this system for years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that when the idea of changing the land tenure system was first raised, on 5th May 1970 during a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the people of the ACT said, at the ensuing by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, what they felt about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710427_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not a reasonable proposition that, though relatively small in the total situation, $25m is a figure which Australia can ill afford to lose, especially when it was committed as a result of a political gimmick on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> 8 years ago, for equipment which has not yet passed the standard necessary for acceptability? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">election</span> was won narrowly by the Australian Labor Parry, but it has been pointed out to me that in that same <span class="highlight">election</span> the Democratic Labor Party very strongly fought the issue on the question of law and order and, although its vote was not large, it was double what it had been previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to point out that in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held last year the Democratic Labor Party put law and order in the forefront of its policies and received the highest vote that it had ever received in its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Party is never afraid to fight an <span class="highlight">election</span> upon the question of law and order and I challenge the Australian Labor Party to defend in an <span class="highlight">election</span> the kind of action by demonstrators that has resulted in this kind of legislation being introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It think it is significant that this was a very small part of the policy of his organisation in the <span class="highlight">election</span> to which he reffered Then the honourable senator complained about some youngsters who misused his telephone, read one of bis pri vate letters - probably one of his bills - sat on the floor of his office and, he alleges, kicked a policeman in the shins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that these are questions to be raised at the Committee stage, but I mention them now as an indication of the matters which will be raised at that stage and to show that it is the desire of the Government to lake away the liberty of individuals and to justify its action for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes by creating a fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Going right back to 1926, I remember a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> that was fought on law and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Government missed the bus in regard to this Bill in that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was not held, I ask: Why clutter up the statute book? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Having created that fear, before an <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government will threaten to use this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">election</span> matter’  in section  116(6) of the Broadcasting and Television Act preclude the Australian Broadcasting  Commission  and commercial  licensees  from  including  in their various news sessions broadcast or televised between the end of an <span class="highlight">election</span> period and the close of the poll on the day on which <span class="highlight">election</span> is held material which is considered to be news and which relates to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it does not necessarily follow that all material relating to an <span class="highlight">election</span> would fall within the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">election</span> matter’ as defined and, in such event, the restriction would not be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides in clause 3 for the recommended increases in the number of open and regional members of the House, clause 4 adjusts the quorum figure for the House and clause 5 provides that the amendments are to apply from the date of completion of the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is anxious that the amendments to the Papua and New Guinea Act contained in this Bill are made as soon as possible so that sufficient time will be available for the necessary redistribution action to be completed and in operation for the 1972 House of Assembly elections in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The note I have here says that in 1970, following a report by the consultants, Maunsell and Partners, the previous South Australian Government and the Commonwealth Government agreed to the project, but after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the present South Australian Government some alternative ideas were suggested’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  feel that I must show my appreciation to  Senator Jim  Toohey, because I feel that it was because of his popularity, the high esteem in which he was held in South Australia and the workthat he had done for the Australian Labor Party that enabled me to be elected as the fifth candidate at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last week in another place the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  indicated that for austerity reasons the Government did not intend now to proceed with a promise given at the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to the people of Australia to establish child minding centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot help but come to the conclusion that this Bill was conceived in the mind of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  after his very narrow <span class="highlight">election</span> to the leadership of the Liberal Party, because until his <span class="highlight">election</span> there was no inkling at all that the Government proposed to embark upon this course of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following that Budget session we had the Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government which had perpetrated the injustices, which I think were felt by the whole community to be injustices, did not do very well in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, but it was able to survive in some kind of fashion because of the support that it received from other quarters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to ensure that we will get justice for these people and the only way we will shock the Government into a realisation that it may be forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> upon this topic is to pass now the amendment I have moved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Democratic Labor Party supports the Government at Budget time and it supports the Government at the time of an <span class="highlight">election</span> and then it comes into this chamber and moves urgency motions, seeks discussions on matters of public importance and says it is sorry for the poor pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Party’s Federal Secretary, Jack Kane, to fill the sixth Senate spot in N.S.W., meant that the DLP finally had a parliamentary strength of five - enough to allow it under standing orders, to introduce its own urgency motions and interrupt the business of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill received a lot of prominence in Queensland during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and  Senator Gair  dealt with it at length in this chamber today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was an increase in pension rates in 1966, but this was done only as a matter of political expediency because an <span class="highlight">election</span> was imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was an increase in pension rates in 1968 because there was a fear that there would be an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was another increase in pension rates in 1969 because another <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one would feel rather happier in welcoming this Bill - even though the amounts promised by way of State grants for the training of pre-school teachers are rather small - were it not for the fact that the Government before the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> undertook to establish pre-school centres throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710512_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is the position in relation to the F111 purchase, which was a political gimmick in 1963 when the then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, in order to win an <span class="highlight">election</span> decided that Australia needed new aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart altogether from the mishandling by the Government of these aircraft projects, the Opposition is of the opinion, as it has expressed in the Parliament and outside the Parliament, that the acceptance by the Government of the F111 was a political gimmick adopted in 1963 in the face of a pending <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is common knowledge, as  Senator Bishop  said, that the original agreement to enter into the purchase of the Fill aircraft in 1963 was a political stunt prior to the 1963 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> when the Government was desperately thrashing around for an issue on which to save itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the month of July 1971, a General <span class="highlight">Election</span> will take place throughout Indonesia, the preparations of which are now in progress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure the smooth performance of the General <span class="highlight">Election</span>, the Government has to maintain an orderly situation of tranquillity and security during the preparations for <span class="highlight">election</span> day and thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears likely therefore, that the circular was issued because of concern at the possibility of foreign diplomats from some countries seeking to take advantage of the period of heightened political activity prior to the elections, rather than from any desire on the part of the Indonesian authorities to restrict opportunities for the outside world to observe the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>for the provision of science laboratories by private schools as compared to State schools has been doubled in the years since 1963 when this proposal was first made by the Government, along with the decision to buy Fill aircraft, as part of its <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmickry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This shortcoming in the Bill is compounded by the fact that an injured employee has no right of <span class="highlight">election</span> in this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710519_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With great respect I suggest that if this sort of situation is going to continue the sooner the Government decides to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> the better off we are all going to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am seriously suggesting that if the Government continues with this attitude through this Budget session then it ought to call it off and have an <span class="highlight">election</span> so that some form of democracy can be returned to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The continuation of the study, dealing with the effect of the 2 media on the vote of the sample in the 1969 Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> is peripheral to the Board’s main interest and will not be published by the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have great associations of workers which under the laws of the Commonwealth are conducted in an extremely democratic manner, in which the members must have control of their committees of management, and in which there are all sorts of provisions for secret ballots and <span class="highlight">election</span> of members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At <span class="highlight">election</span> time its members go through the pretence of asking the people to vote for them, giving electors the misguided idea that in the Parliament and through the Government they would determine the political decisions to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite cannot do so because they are wedded to a system which will permit the use of industrial power to thwart the wishes of the Government elected by the people of Australia and claiming the electoral authority which comes from having a mandate given at ah <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the happy day comes and there is an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the people will reaffirm what they have reaffirmed every time since 1949, namely, that our way of government in a democracy is a better way than the system advocated by the Opposition, and it will give stability to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-128-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was because it was just before a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> that these matters were brought before the Senate and the closure of the debate was moved in order to get a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because, by some freak of <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Democratic Labor Party numbers have been raised to five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710819_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-95-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does the Government justify the vast expenditure of lives and money and the vast amount of misery in Vietnam to achieve the farcical situation where only one man,  President  Thieu, is likely to contend the elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If VicePresident Ky after being forced out of the <span class="highlight">election</span> by  President  Thieu’s manoeuvres decides to stage a coup, which side will Australia support military and economically? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Australian Labor Party’s great concern to ensure that parliamentary elections are held in the countries of South East Asia, especially South Vietnam, I ask the Minister: What was the date on which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was held which resulted in the appointment of Chou En-lai as Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister advise how many candidates contested the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the supposed vacancy had arisen out of a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, the ultimate wash-up was that both the Senate Standing Committee on Disputed Returns and Qualifications and ultimately the High Court held that there should be a general <span class="highlight">election</span> and not an appointment under the provisions of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710824_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to his reply to my question yesterday on the Vietnam <span class="highlight">election</span> when he said, as part of his reply: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him again: Has the Australian Government protested about the undemocratic <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held in South Vietnam where President Thieu has effectively ensured that the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be a travesty of democracy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A subsequent question was posed by  Senator Sim,  I think, who pointed out that in some nations, which members of the Australian Labor Party seem to be in a hurry to visit, there are circumstances in which only one candidate stands for <span class="highlight">election</span> and, what is more, there is no Leader of the Opposition, and that is a pretty serious matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That a government could actively strive for such a result, with all its attendant financial and human misery, is an indictment which will gravely affect this Government at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This occurred in Australia in 1969 when, with demand moving strongly, but with a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> coming up after the Budget, the Government was aware of the electoral dangers in bringing in a Budget to control inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>25 for pensioners was still their biggest cash rise in years, no doubt because the Prime Minister was contemplating an early <span class="highlight">election</span> until his Party disintegrated about him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recipients of social service benefits are humiliated at every <span class="highlight">election</span> to find that their income is the subject of bargaining from the hustings, one political party offering this and another party offering something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710825_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard it as being of more importance as the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span> approaches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the results on <span class="highlight">election</span> night, if we have brought something to the public’s notice, if we have had a good debate on it, if we have brought out the various points of view and if we have caused the whole nation to think along the lines we suggested, we have achieved something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They  man  the polling booths, distribute literature and give many other services during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-55-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The whole of these proceedings took place before the Senate as it was constituted prior to and up to 30th June this year when, following the periodic <span class="highlight">election</span> for half of the Senate, the personnel of the Senate changed, a number of honourable senators having retired and a number of new honourable senators having joined this chamber and subsequently been sworn in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate itself persists, subject to periodic elections, and it goes on therefore in an unbroken stream discharging its duties as an integral part of the legislature and of the legislative process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710826_senate_27_s49/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Leader of the Government in the Senate remember that during the 1970 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, 10 months ago, the then Prime Minister promised to establish child care centres for working mothers and suggested that between 500 and 750 centres were contemplated? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government consider that child care centres are still necessary or has it repudiated the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government found education sufficiently important to promise concerted action on a national survey before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This situation has resulted from an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1949 when a Leader of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Basically he won the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the promise to bring value back  into  the 1. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1969  Mr Gorton,  when Prime Minister, made certain promises in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During last year’s Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Gorton  made a similar promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the new Parliament we will further investigate this complicated problem with a view to presenting to you at the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1952 a scheme for your approval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710907_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-78-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The promises made by  Mr Gorton  in the 1969

    <p>The Australian Labor Party has got so far in front of the Government in its statesmanlike attitude to matters that the Government would be afraid to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> tomorrow because it would not last long enough to count its deposits, if they were returned to its candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As hundreds of Australian conscripts have been killed in South Vietnam while allegedly fighting to preserve democracy and as Air Vice-Marshal Ky was until recently held in high regard by the Australian Government, why has this Government done nothing about his allegations of a lack of democracy in the South Vietnam presidential <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did this Liberal journal state that it was time the Government realised that it has only a slim chance of winning the next federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and that the Liberal Party of Australia urgently needs some initiative at the helm? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the period I was out of office, from the day before the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> until 1st July this year, I was engaged by the store to act as a public relations officer, as one commissioned to speak to groups within the community and to detail to them the facts concerning the ACTU acquisition of this store. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In making my first speech as a senator for Victoria may I say that I am very conscious of the honour which has been given to me by my State in my <span class="highlight">election</span> as one of its senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only reward that they ever seek is to assist in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor government which will quickly take the necessary steps to ensure that the gross inequities existing in Australia today are replaced by a humane policy of compassion and understanding, so that the one million citizens at present struggling to exist below the poverty line can lift up their heads and live a life of dignity, free from the fear of want, sickness and old age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the DLP has put this Government in power in the past and, without any doubt, it will support the Government at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> in an endeavour, this time we believe unsuccessfully, to help it to keep on carrying out policies such as those which are condemned in its amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710915_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first undertaking - a famous one - was to put value back into the ?1, and the second was to introduce and present at the 1952 <span class="highlight">election</span> for the approval of the people a national superannuation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our Leader,  Mr Whitlam,  when electioneering during the 1969 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign made the promise that when Labor was returned to government it would see that the percentage relationship between the average weekly earnings and the pension payments would remain static at 25 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest, also, in all sincerity that if it had not been for the fear of an early general <span class="highlight">election</span> 12 months before it was due, plus the fact that pressure would have been applied by the Opposition in this Parliament, the $1.25 and $1 respectively would not have been granted to pensioners on this occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>B. Chifley survived the 1949 <span class="highlight">election</span> national contributory insurance would have come into being and - as in the case of the Dominion of New Zealand - the means test would not still adorn the Commonwealth statute book. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the former Prime Minister the Right Honourable John Gorton made a speech to the Australian people in which he stated that child minding centres would be established throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At every <span class="highlight">election</span> time and every Budget time the income of the poor old pensioner is thrown into the field of discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that recipients of these benefits are humiliated at every <span class="highlight">election</span> to find that their income is subject to public political bargaining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Apparently the Australian Labor Party would prefer the present system to remain in force so that that Party can gain political capital at an <span class="highlight">election</span> out of any increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under that system he will be free from the humiliation which he suffers every time his income is discussed at <span class="highlight">election</span> time or in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>i notice that in the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Leader of the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Whitlam,  suggested - 1 think  Senator McAuliffe  referred to this in the course of his remarks - that the pension payments should be one-quarter of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I will not deal with it, any more than I will deal with national superannuation, other than to say that governments in the past have been committed in <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speeches to the introduction of a national insurance scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, Robert Gordon Menzies is reported to have resigned from the Lyons Government because the Lyons Government could not see its way clear to give effect to an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it because the Government and the Opposition like pensions to be in a political arena to be used as a football, or as a bribe to -get votes at <span class="highlight">election</span> time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-93-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 recall that in the early 1950s, when 1 was campaign director for  Mr Whitlam  and he succeeded in gaining entry into the national Parliament, the Returned Services League submitted a 9-point pension plan to all candidates in that <span class="highlight">election</span> seeking their support for policies for which the RSL is still pressing some 20 years later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 think I should bring to the attention of honourable senators that the Democratic Labor Party, and particularly  Senator Gair,  campaigned in Queensland during the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and made as a particular point their opposition to increased post and telegraph charges, but when the issue came down to a vote they did not oppose the increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the Minister is aware that we make our policy known following our Federal or State conferences, as the case may be, and during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government consider that its carrying on of an undeclared war in Vietnam in supposed support of democratic government can still be justified after the 90 per cent vote in favour of President Thieu in a one man <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point  1  make is that it is not unique to have one candidate at an <span class="highlight">election</span> getting  95  per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1  do not want to hurt anybody’s feelings, but I must say that I have been Leader of the Government in the Senate for a long time now and I never have questions directed to me to elicit criticism of elections held in Mainland China or Russia, behind the Iron Curtain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, has he also noted that a leading Victorian trade union official is reported to have issued the warning that if  Mr Clyde  Cameron’s views were made mandatory Victorian trade unions would not provide finance for the Australian Labor Party at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is fascinating that I have never heard the Opposition query the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> in North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite honourable senators to consider the Hursey case in which a man and his son, waterside workers, refused to pay a levy to the Waterside Workers Federation at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, because half of it would go to the Communist Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I have a good ally in that because after the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span> no other than  Mrs Whitlam  advocated the conscription of the young womanhood of Australia for the defence of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States and South Vietnam dissociated themselves from it because they did not believe that conditions would exist for a free <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must say that that did not indicate that he wished to take the risk of having a free <span class="highlight">election</span> which he might not win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that East Germany with 15 million people would not take the risk of losing a free <span class="highlight">election</span> because in a unified Germany they would have no say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would have hoped that they had a policy that they were able to demonstrate to the people at a forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> was in the best interests of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should an <span class="highlight">election</span> be held on this issue, they certainly would not win and occupy the Government benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>not overlook the possibility- not that the Communists would win, as  Senator Cavanagh  said - that a free <span class="highlight">election</span> may- again a qualification - be an <span class="highlight">election</span> which establishes a Communist administration in the whole of Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711007_senate_27_s49/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the situation with this <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation in this <span class="highlight">election</span> is that there is only one candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of the most eminent South Vietnamese, General Minh and Air ViceMarshal Ky - not so long ago feted on his visit to this country - have condemned the actions of President Thieu and the Saigon Government for the undemocratic manner in which they have conducted this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, one hears from various people the specious argument: ‘There are not free elections in North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many candidates are there for the Prime Ministership of the Soviet Union’?, as if this is some devastating, knock-down argument for use against anybody who asks: ‘What is the situation in regard to the elections in South Vietnam’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test came, among other things, with the conduct of the presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held on the Sunday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I left Australia on last Friday week to attend as an observer at the presidential <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I had the opportunity - the only opportunity of anyone from this Parliament and perhaps from Australia - of observing just how the <span class="highlight">election</span> was conducted and to what extend it did comply with democratic forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is my duty tonight in this very short time available to me as far as I can to report faithfully, accurately, and, J trust, objectively what were the results of my observations and to what extent I thought the <span class="highlight">election</span> complied with the ordinary democratic forms of the electoral process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not opt for such a trip because I thought that in the economy of time of an <span class="highlight">election</span> that commenced at 7 o’clock in the morning and concluded at 5 o’clock in the evening it was only fair that I should attempt to observe the <span class="highlight">election</span> in the capital city, Saigon, as well as, and as far as possible, the operation of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in one of the provincial areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To have gone to Da Nang or Hue may have deprived me of any opportunity of observing the <span class="highlight">election</span> in Saigon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elections were conducted under the presidential law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing was, first of all, that the elections should be held in pursuance of that law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a copy of the presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> law here, which perhaps 1 might be wise to table at the end of my speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> law the whole of the procedures which are to be followed in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a  president  are laid down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are most comprehensive in that they specify the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the nature of the polling, the selection of candidates, the operations of parties, moneys provided, even by the Government, to parties to conduct their campaigns, and things of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> had to be operated under that law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my objective assessment  -  I am myself a lawyer  -  I found that the <span class="highlight">election</span> was conducted explicitly in terms of their own law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly, if I table it, you may have access to this document to see whether you think it does in all ways comply with the ordinary principles that you would expect a free <span class="highlight">election</span> to comply with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second question was that if the <span class="highlight">election</span> complied with the presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> law, was that <span class="highlight">election</span> law a law in terms of the ordinarily accepted canons of democratic free elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the principles which one would apply to determine whether an <span class="highlight">election</span> was conducted according to the canons which we would want to apply to determine whether an <span class="highlight">election</span> was free and democratic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Saigon in the morning the voters were present in great numbers, as you would find them in an Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore they have - and it is prescribed in the presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> law - a slate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was told that at the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held a week or a fortnight before that at one place there were 81 candidates for  5  electoral positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case, the presidential <span class="highlight">election</span>, he was presented with one slip because there was only one group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, it could be the B coupon because the A coupon had been used for the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The count and the conduct of the <span class="highlight">election</span> appeared to be in the hands of schoolteachers just as we have schoolteachers as our presiding officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The envelopes were counted in the public view and were tallied just as we might tally an <span class="highlight">election</span> if we went in and acted as scrutineers as we have done so often at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If something is not done to rope those people into the scheme, it certainly will become a noose around the Government’s neck at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711014_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 know that during the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year it was bandied around that the Commonwealth Government was providing $100,n for the reconstruction of the wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the wool aid emergency scheme about which we heard so much 2 years ago, despite the establishment of the Australian Wool Commission about which we heard so much 12 months ago, just before the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and despite the introduction of legislation of the type we are debating today, the simple fact is that the wool growers of this country are in a parlous situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This reminds me that that proposal was submitted by the former Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  during the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We proposed during the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and we reiterate now that the only body capable of providing the finance to meet the needs of the rural people today is the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Coupled with the Country Party’s fading power as its rural chickens come home to roost, could this move be construed as a final desperate attempt to hold the Party together long enough to secure a few votes at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, or is it perhaps an indication that  Mr Anthony- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government holding back on the implementation of this most urgent reform so that it can be used again as an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick for the general <span class="highlight">election</span> which is to be held in 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy included in the Government <span class="highlight">election</span> programme in 1969 included a promise to reduce personal income tax on middle and lower incomes over 3 years by $200m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This proposal arose initially in 1963 when the Labor Party indicated in the course of the preparation of its policy for the 1964 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> that this proposition would be supported financially. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then, as  Senator Devitt  said, a very small number of the faithful were able to get the idea written into the Australian Labor Party Federal policy - not State policy - for the 1964 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The determination of what that jurisdiction should be was a most time consuming task and it was not completed when the Parliament was prorogued for the <span class="highlight">election</span> which took place in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711111_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In considering this question honourable senators should have in mind how much time is available forcommittee work  -  I refer not just to the hours of meeting of committees; how much time is available in the Senate - and we come here for at least 26 weeks in a year to attend sittings of the Senate; and how much time there is for the electorate and for elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711123_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-92-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As one - who has at least some political nous about how elections are won, I challenge them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The genius of the Liberal Party - which you are displaying - is to be able to squib at every <span class="highlight">election</span> time the result of its last 3 years in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It knows that that is not the situation, but it knows that the best way to win elections is to avoid standing up to its stewardship by trying to put the blame and the fear onto other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The usual plea will be made for cooperation but from now to <span class="highlight">election</span> day in every consultation with a Minister we will have to say: ‘Do 1 go this far or do I try to trap him?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 concede that there was an Achilles heel in that instance but had we chosen to do so we could have sought to capitalise on the incident as an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In directing a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I refer to the statement made on televisionlast night by the Prime Minister that the state of the economy would not be an issue in the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When it is time for the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>, the result will be an overwhelming victory for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far, the steps taken are that last year during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign it was announced by the then Prime Minister that steps would be taken in relation to the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In October 1970, the previous Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  in his policy speech for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, announced that the Commonwealth Government would establish an Office of the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make this point: In December, less than 2 months after the Government had been returned at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the then Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of the States inviting their co-operation in coming together to discuss the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>one of the factors to blame for the state of the Northern Territory rolls for the recent Legislative Council <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Bourke,  who was called to the Territory during the <span class="highlight">election</span> owing to the illness of the Electoral . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that promises have been made that the electoral rolls will be updated before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the Northern Territory <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I was at Katherine and Tennant Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The number who voted at the <span class="highlight">election</span> gives distorted figures of population in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In it we see, as we have seen so many times in the past, that the price of wool bottomed in late October of last year, just prior to the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and it peaked virtually on the day thai poll was conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span> the price of wool slumps again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore it should be the right of a State to be able to exercise its own political judgment on the basis of its <span class="highlight">election</span> to government by the people of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will note that the Opposition’s amendment adopts the precedent that is set out in one of the subclauses of clause 10 for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the  Deputy Chairman  in the House of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711210_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the reasoon why this has suddenly become a matter of great anxiety to the gentlemen opposite is that they have lost one of their great stocksintrade with which they have been accustomed to giving the Australian people nightmares, especially in <span class="highlight">election</span> years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720222_senate_27_s51/#debate-133">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was perhaps the first and only party in Australia to put forward a definite proposition on this matter for adoption by the people of Australia at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose the greatest national disaster which could befall us would be the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> was pending and the Government made a gesture in the area that  Senator Douglas  McClelland knows a lot better than I do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to honourable senators opposite that if they want to make an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue of this matter we will welcome it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious to me that if things keep going as they are, another <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held before I get the chance to talk on my motion on this subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720223_senate_27_s51/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has only to go back to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of about 1952 when  Mr Menzies,  as he then was, said that Australia had 3 years to prepare itself against a possible conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We must come to the conclusion that the Government, having lost the yellow hordes of Asia as an issue, is looking for an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will try to convince the Australian people that this presence constitutes a great menace to us and will try to engender a feeling of fear about it in an attempt to win the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Ministers of these countries - as distinct from our own Prime Minister whom 1 will admit, to my knowledge, has not made a pronouncement on the matter but will during the coming general <span class="highlight">election</span> - came to the same conclusion as  Mr Friedheim,  again of the United States, who in Washington on 10th January when he was discussing the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean had something to say which is in accordance with the standpoint of most of the nations in the Indian Ocean region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 remind those optimistic members of the Australian Labor Parly who feel that they have more cause to be optimistic now than they have had for many years that in February 1963  -  a memorable <span class="highlight">election</span> year - ‘the unemployment figures were higher, in terms of percentages, than they are now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720224_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has the Leader seen a copy of the McKinsley report, commissioned by the Victorian Liberal Party, which indicates that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held now the coalition would lose heavily? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this indicate that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held now a Labor government would be returned to office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, can this demarcation dispute be resolved by the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government which would amalgamate all 3 branches of the defence forces into one efficient department? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up until the Evatt amendment of 1947 one had to resign from the Public Service in order to stand for Parliament and pray that one either did not lose or, if one lost, got back into the Public Service after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion suggests that the Senate, the political master, be invited to conduct an inquiry into the servant, the Public Service in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have often suspected that the Opposition had no sense of humour, but the thought that in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year there could be anything approaching an objective inquiry into the Public Service surely is a joke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that under our quaint system of elections almost every year is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Willesee  said, this would affect such interesting things as the wages policy of the Public Service in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people object to the National Service Act and want to have it repealed, as I understand is the policy of the Australian Labor Party, there is a legitimate means by which that ultimate objective may be pursued - that is, by making it an issue at the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very easy to say that all wrongs can be rectified at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A previous <span class="highlight">election</span> would have rectified that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>All wrongs cannot be rectified at any particular general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of other principles in the Opposition’s policy for the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>, we may see the end of the National Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is wrong to say that the suffering of a person as a result of the passing of oppressive legislation introduced by a government, despite the great support that person may have and despite the unanimous or majority opinion of electors on that particular issue, can be rectified at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While it can be said that there was some mandate by majority at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, minorities have to be given some recognition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that when he is required to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition will not oppose his re-<span class="highlight">election</span>! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because it is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year these political procedures are being revealed in the machinery of government and the machinery of opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without giving too much emphasis to it, let me mention that we all know it is true that the Labor Party has a selected candidate for a seat in the State of Victoria for a pending Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has of course, referred to the relationship be: ween the Opposition and a person who is one of its candidates for an <span class="highlight">election</span> which is lo be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the, Australian Labor Party, having some pretention to persuading the people to give it power after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, to use a man like  Mr Johnston  as a carcass around which to generate a public campaign is a despicable performance for any organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party has endorsed Barry Johnston as a candidate for the forthcoming House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Labor Party has endorsed this man, who has not committeed a crime at this stage, as a candidate for an <span class="highlight">election</span> it is the subject of condemnation by honourable senators on the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Byrne  has said, the matter on which the Attorney-General commented very properly in carrying out his official duty was the extraordinary and deplorable behaviour of a candidate who has been endorsed by the ALP to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to this Parliament and who has thumbed his nose at the due process of law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Johnston,  who is to be the Australian Labor Party candidate for Hotham at the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, attended a meeting of the Australian Labor Party as an endorsed Labor candidate,  Senator Greenwood  not only prejudged his guilt, as was so ably proved this afternoon by  Senator Murphy,  but also tried to gain cheap political capital - but achieved notoriety and, 1 suppose, infamy - by launching an attack not only on  Mr Johnston  but also on the Labor leader, the Leader of the Opposition in another place  (Mr Whitlam),  the  President  of the Victorian branch of the Labor movement,  Mr Crawford,  and on every member of the Labor movement throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although you have not been tried for an offence, because the Attorney-General has said that you are guilty you should not come to a Labor conference as the endorsed Labor candidate for Hotham, offering yourself for <span class="highlight">election</span> and asking the people to give you a mandate to represent them in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And we have been prepared to put that issue to the people <span class="highlight">election</span> after <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a man who now, as a member of the Australian Labor Party and that Party’s endorsed Labor candidate for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, has been served with a notice to attend for call-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>is on the verge of an <span class="highlight">election</span> victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia faces no discernible threat, in the words of the Liberal’s ex-Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  for at least the next 10 years and an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held in the next few months as a result of which a government will be elected which is pledged to repeal the law under which  Mr Johnston  has been charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances I do not believe that  Mr Hughes  would have recommended the prosecution of a candidate of one of the major political parties who was alleged to he calling in question by his own conduct a law which will be a major issue in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in which he is a candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Parly insists on sticking to this lack, to placate its left wingers, it may so disenchant the electorate that it commits the equal absurdity of throwing away an <span class="highlight">election</span> which up to now has looked already won. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has indicated also that after the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> there will not be a draft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I believe that the Labor Party will reverse that policy before the next <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They believe that they can use the Australian Democratic Labor Party or any other means during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to gain power and that the power thus granted to them allows them to embark on anything to any limits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But it has been the philosophy of this Government that if it can deceive the people at <span class="highlight">election</span> time it can protect the status quo by any methods at all, particularly deception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government introduce legislation before the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> to require the publication in a public register of all substantial financial contributions directly or indirectly to any political party or organisation which supports candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is an interesting question because in recent weeks when Labor Party leaders have risen to give a dissertation on what their policies are to be for the <span class="highlight">election</span> I have been reminded of a Walter Mitty test pilot in action because each day they take up a new kind of aircraft, test it, see whether it will fly with the wind but invariably it crashes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote something which was quoted in 3 or papers, and which was analysed as such and not denied, of what  Mr Whitlam  said in opening the Labor Parly’s Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They know - those of them who are listening tonight can judge me when I next come up for <span class="highlight">election</span> - that every wage increase they receive which is not matched by an increase in productivity takes from them the standard of living that they want to enjoy, and that every advantage they gain, in terms of increased leave, which is not matched by an expansion of the economy and an expansion of production only makes it more difficult for the pensioners and superannuitants on their fixed incomes to survive in our community as it is today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I say again to the business community and the manufacturing community: If you expect to have your interests reasonably regarded, it is necessary for you to provide a quota from your area for the Parliament, rather than think, perhaps, that because you make a donation at <span class="highlight">election</span> time your interests will be safeguarded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he read the reported statement by the Leader of the Opposition in another place,  Mr Whitlam,  when in Ade laide attending the unusually quiet Australian Labor Party Federal Executive meeting, that Labor would try very hard - I believe this is significant enough to repeat - labor would try very hard - to raise a volunteer army and do away with conscription if it won the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that if the Australian Labor Party won an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this basis action would be taken by the Federal body, which is the boss, to ensure that its own real views of intense antagonism to the independent schools would be put into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 shall conclude by setting out 6 points of principle on which I oppose entirely this proposition for an independent schools commission which  Mr Whitlam  says is one of the big issues on which he will fight the November <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that  Senator Young  has preselection problems which have been complicated further by the possibility of  Mr Hall  seeking a berth on the Senate ticket for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Young  finds himself in a somewhat similar position and seeks to use the Australian Labor Party as a whipping horse to bolster his chance of pre-selection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government at every opportunity is raising the suggestion that law and order is at stake and is apparently intending to create a bogey to bolster its chances of winning the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Il is also evident in the action by the Attorney-General in .stepping up prosecutions against national service objectors in this the <span class="highlight">election</span> year while some of these prosecutions may well have been effected two years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The danger of law and order myth as even a semblance of an issue lies in the re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of a Government which could then claim a mandate for more and more repressive laws as did the Nazi Party in Germany. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State Ministers for Agriculture agreed that the best solution to the problem should be to provide for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of producer representatives to the Board in lieu of the existing provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-105-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A producer will be entitled to vote at a poll and to be a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> if he is the owner of 200 hives of bees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-105-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposals have been submitted by the apiarist associations in Western Australia and New South Wales that it be made a condition that candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> should be restricted to persons who only pack honey from their own hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-105-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This poposal is not acceptable as it is considered that as provision is being made for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of producer members it should be left to the producers to decide by a majority vote whether a beekeeper with packer interests should be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-105-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State apiarists associations in the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations have all accepted the principle of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of producer representatives and it is considered that the amendments proposed will give honey producers added confidence in their representatives on the Board which is necessary to enable the Board to continue to conduct its affairs in the best interests of the Australian honey industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-105-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to qualify as a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> or for the right to vote for a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Honey Board an apiarist must have 200 hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I am in full agreement with the provision that a person should have 200 hives in order to be eligible to become a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> or to vote at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is provision in this Bill for packers to be appointed quite apart from the <span class="highlight">election</span> of honey producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia in the case of the <span class="highlight">election</span> some 3 years ago of a member of the Egg Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to 5 people on one farm were allowed to vote for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a member to the Egg Board because of the wording of the relevant Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They fear that the same thing may occur in the case of <span class="highlight">election</span> of members to the Honey Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these dates were to be used as the criteria for determining who was to be qualified to vote at this first <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Honey Board it would give an unfair advantage to some people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Primary Industry to have a consultation with the State Ministers for Agriculture at some future date - I know it cannot be done before this <span class="highlight">election</span> - to see whether something can be done to bring about a uniform registration date in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each State would then have the same registration date for the purpose of future elections of the Honey Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister for Air  (Senator Drake-Brockman)  who in this chamber represents the Minister for Primary Industry may be able to tell us why, at this time, a uniform registration date cannot be introduced for this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill - this is why it should be fully commended by the Senate - is to change this unsatisfactory method of appointment of producer members and to provide for a reasonable form of democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> by the producers themselves of their representatives on the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, on this point of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of representatives of honey producers to the Honey Board, the eligibility qualification of 200 hives does embrace the major honey producers of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although, as I have said,  1  believe that this change in the method of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of representatives of honey producers to the Board will go a long way towards removing the dissatisfaction that obviously exists among certain producers in the honey industry, it is my opinion that a good deal of dissatisfaction will continue to be felt because a referendum of honey producers to seek their views on whether or not this Board is required has never been held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the general set-up of the new board and the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> of members will be better than the method that has been adopted in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we can safely leave the <span class="highlight">election</span> of representatives in the hands of the people who are eligible to elect representatives on the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Bill is passed there will be a poll of producers at least for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of producer representatives on the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Minister’s second reading speech, the amending Bill lays down that there will be a poll for the <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Honey Board and that eligibility to vote will be restricted to those producers of honey having 200 or more hives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>to extend the terms of office of the present industry members of the Board to 30th June 1972 or such later date as may be specified by the Minister to enable the <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was that the South Australian Apiarists Association requested that eligibility to vote or eligibility to stand as a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Australian Honey Board should be based on the ownership of 200 hives at the last date of registration instead of the time of voting as provided in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>figure of 200 hives was arrived at as the number which would give as many people as possible the right to vote and to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, that includes the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the representatives as well as other matters which might be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have already raised in this chamber the issue in relation to a decision of the High Court of Australia in the case of Willocks and Anderson in which the High Court invalidated regulations which purported to confer jurisdiction upon the High Court to act as a court of disputed returns over the mere matter of a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span> for the membership of the Apple and Pear Board, I think it was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720411_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-107-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am prompted by  Senator Maunsell  to recall that, whether we like it or not, a famous Commonwealth <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in 1938 during which a future Labor Prime Minister argued about the supremacy of the air arm. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the evidence of what happened in Victoria over the weekend who knows but that by the next <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition again may be a rabble and the DLP, with its small numbers, will have to do the Opposition’s job as it has been doing for a considerable period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720419_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government in the general <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1969 and the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1970 said that it would negotiate with the health insurance funds regarding the payment of increased benefits for nursing home patients who have been regular contributors to health insurance funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720420_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No doubt the Leader of the Government in the Senate is aware of the result of last Saturday’s State <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Tasmanian House of Assembly at which the Australian Labor Party won a handsome majority in every electorate, and also that the Leader of the Liberal Party resigned his leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government guarantee that any recommended scheme will be placed before the public well before the <span class="highlight">election</span> so that its advantages and disadvantages, in relation particularly to the economic factors involved, can be debated at length? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to secure these policy objectives, there were 5 desirable objectives in the October 1969 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, (a) prevention of the ALP victory which would have destroyed national service, the ‘forward defence’ policy and the  pesence  in Vietnam; (b) reduction of the Government’s majority to a still comfortable 6-7 seats, to ensure that the Government could not claim any popular mandate for its defence or ‘Russian’ policies <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be recalled that at a recent Senate inquiry in the United States it was revealed that this giant conglomerate first of all set out to try to prevent the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Allende Government in Chile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable senators that, first of all, ITT attempted to prevent the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Allende Government - although we do not like that type of government, nevertheless it was democratically elected - and, having failed to prevent that Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> ITT set out then to destroy the Chilean economy as a means of destroying that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At every <span class="highlight">election</span> that has taken place since the DLP came into existence in 1955, the DLP has boasted proudly that it has propped up in office this Government which has committed itself to this policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well recall in the 1966 <span class="highlight">election</span> - the Vietnam <span class="highlight">election</span>, the khaki <span class="highlight">election</span> - a DLP spokesman saying that Australia could not afford to do anything about overseas capital or to impose restraints upon overseas capital at that time because such action could place in jeopardy the interest that the United States of America might take in the defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Already the announcement has been made that at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the DLP again will be giving its preferences to the present Government- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that already the announcement has been made that at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the DLP again will be giving its preferences to the present Government which has not as yet introduced any legislative or administrative proposals to stop this carnivorous eating of Australia’s national assets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, when a Labor government is elected to office in the next federal <span class="highlight">election</span> it will take action to stop this flood of capital coming into this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The danger in this respect - again,  Senator Kane  hinted at this - is: How far will such a company interfere in a country’s Internal operations at <span class="highlight">election</span> time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of squabbling about what is going on in the country and speculating on who will win the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and on how it will be won, the Government must realise that this important legislation requires amendment at the earliest opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I join my colleagues on this side of the Senate in expressing disappointment that the report, of the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources, which deliberated for 2 to 3 years, should receive such scant recognition by the Senate only a few weeks prior to the winter recess, with a busy Budget session ahead and with an <span class="highlight">election</span> in November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While a Press statement which was released states that no decision has yet been taken, I again ask the Minister whether the Government will guarantee that the details of any recommended scheme will be put up for public discussion before the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> or whether the giving of such a guarantee will be refused because of the divisions in the coalition Government about that scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I was at Mount Hagen in the week before the opening of the House, a person who had been deeply concerned with that area for 20 years said, when I asked him for his view of the understanding of the people of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that approximately 80 per cent of the individ uals entitled to vote would have voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720511_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Queensland 3 years ago it was only natural that the Country Party Premier of Queensland and his Cabinet Ministers, on their tours of the State, would come in for some criticism in country areas regarding the inequality of freight charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One could be excused for wondering whether there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> around the corner somewhere in the next week or two because of the remarks which have come from the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before entering this field of the <span class="highlight">election</span> - after all I have to reply to some of the unfair criticism which has been levelled against the Government - I think that I should speak to the Bill and the reason for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Queensland Government - one might well say that it will be the Government for many years to come, perhaps even for decades, despite the rather fine political speeches heard tonight; I might even term them part of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigning that has been carried on tonight by some Opposition senators from Queensland - applied to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for special assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have not pointed out these things merely because a State <span class="highlight">election</span> is being held in Queensland this month, although it seems to me to be strange that members of the Opposition said quite a lot in this debate in condemnation of the Queensland Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720516_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By amendment of the Bill in the House, we have provided that an action under section 141 of the Act in relation to an <span class="highlight">election</span> for office in an organisation must be taken within 12 months of the completion of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By virtue of  a  further amendment in the House, we have made a like provision in relation to application for an inquiry into a court-controlled’ ballot for <span class="highlight">election</span> to office in an organisation except that the period for instituting proceedings is 6 and not 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that point, the <span class="highlight">election</span> meeting was brought down with laughter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is for you,  Senator Georges,  as a Queensland senator claiming to represent your State, to make a judgment upon in your own State during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, but hardly in the Commonwealth Senate when it is dealing with a Commonwealth Grants Commission Bill designed to give $9m to the people of your State in order to lift living standards there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the second score,  I  do not know how he will explain why the Queensland Premier in 1969 gave an assurance to the people of Queensland, prior to the previous State <span class="highlight">election</span>, that he would order an inquiry into the freight anomalies in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>lt was a very poor show that he should take the opportunity in winding up the debate - that is what the situation amounted to because our intention was not to enter into a major debate on the third reading of the Bill - to be facetiously provocative and to accuse the Opposition of turning the debate into a forum for an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the Minister’s benefit, I inform him that the $9m that  Mr Johannes  Bjelke-Petersen is getting under this legislation will be paying for part of his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a hardy perennial which is raised every time there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was said that there was an electioneering aspect about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The debate from the other side of the chamber did have an <span class="highlight">election</span> flair to it and 1 am quite confident that if the Queensland elections were not to be held on 27th May we would not have had the outburst that we have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood  is the one who mentioned the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is the one who claimed that we were electioneering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held on Saturday week, and it is patently obvious that the question asked by the honourable senator, which bears absolutely no relationship to any matter of Commonwealth responsibility, is but one way in which some cheap publicity might be secured for a party which cannot get any other publicity that is likely to assist it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not I know what the Queensland Police Union is doing; whether or not I believe what it is doing reflects confidence or otherwise in a government, obviously are only questions which could be designed to ensure that this Senate becomes a forum for the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that my Party at one time, under certain leadership, had the odd impression that it could win elections by the number of matters of urgency that it put on the notice paper for discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there came the time when the Democratic Labor Party, following the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Senator Kane,  had sufficient numbers to stand in this place in justification of the raising of matters of urgency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask the Minister: As any such scheme would vitally affect the aircraft industry, its skilled workers and the future role of the Government Aircraft Factories in the national scheme, does he consider it necessary that a decision be made before the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> is held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will be the Minister for Labour after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in that case he will revert the whole thinking on legislation back to conciliation, where it should be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must accept that the Minister was the member of a political party which, popular opinion polls showed, was out of favour with the people and would never see the light of day in a subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware thai a magistrate’s court held at Brisbane on 13th and 14th March 1972 for the purpose of taking evidence into the alleged disappearance of drought aid funds was transferred from a public court to a conference room in the Brisbane Treasury Building with an allegedly inadequate period of notice to the public and has now been adjourned until a date after the State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had occasion to say before that it is an unobservant person who would not realise that there is a State <span class="highlight">election</span> about to take place in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I only regret that the Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span> has produced the result that this forum is available for the purpose of debating Queensland State issues which have absolutely no relevance to any issue concerning this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-57-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If honourable senators opposite think that they can influence the Queensland <span class="highlight">election</span> by going there tomorrow, one day before the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, they amaze me. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind him that 53.7 per cent of the members voted in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> conducted by the Federated Clerks Union of Australia in 1970; that in 1964, 59.4 per cent of the members voted; and that in 1961, 68.6 per cent of the members voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, in the 1967 ballot for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officials the Port Kembla branch showed a return  of  55.23 per cent and the Victorian branch showed a return of 56.04 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that there is no doubt in my mind, as I know there is no doubt in the minds of anyone on this side of the chamber or in the minds of honourable senators on the other side that this Bill is a political stunt to try to save the Government’s hide at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This has been a deliberate act by the Government in seeking an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue or to build up its lost prestige. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill has been presented in order to confront the trade union movement with the pernicious clauses it contains for the purpose of fighting an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue of law and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government thought at one stage that the big <span class="highlight">election</span> issue would be apartheid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At one <span class="highlight">election</span> Petrov was used as the big issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Government has kicked the communist can as often as possible in recent <span class="highlight">election</span> periods until the people have become sick and tired of it and it can no longer be used as an issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In one <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government used the Vietnam war as an issue and on that occasion it was successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their policy, at least in Victoria for many years, has been one of freedom to vote, particularly in municipal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that some municipalities in Victoria by their own decision have made voting compulsory, but the vast majority of local government elections in Victoria are held on the basis that a person eligible to vote may do so or may decline to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that only 25 per cent to 30 per cent of eligible ratepayers have voted in the majority of local government elections in Victoria, at least in cities, towns and shires outside the metropolitan area of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is so concerned about this great democratic method of <span class="highlight">election</span> it should move quickly to that end, with the co-operation of State parliaments, to ensure that this system of so-called democracy is available to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is strange to note that each year prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government introduces a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We find again this year that prior to a general <span class="highlight">election</span> we are debating another Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are only 5 or 6 altogether in this Bill which is so important that it has to be rushed through on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was the legislation which this Government put through the Parliament in the dying stages of the 1970 autumn session and prior to the 1970 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A similar pattern was disclosed at the 1968 elections, at which there was a ballot for similar-, positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Government now thinks - as it did in 1970  -  that the best weapon it has to fool the people on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> is legislation to alter the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is more important - and this is the assurance that we give to the Australian people - upon our <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of this year we shall repeal this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was that section written into the Act by the Chifley Labor Government as a result of the ‘John Austral’ series of radio broadcasts which were dramatisations of political matters deliberately connected with an <span class="highlight">election</span> and deliberately designed to influence the results of a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that there should be appropriate procedures which will enable the advantages and the disadvantages of amalgamation to be made known to the various members of the organisations, that the members of the organisations will have the opportunity to vote, not in accordance with the rules of the organisations but in accordance with the way in which a court conducted ballot will ensure that the <span class="highlight">election</span> is conducted fairly and so that there should be an effective membership decision as to whether or not the amalgamation is to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If those people not only want to preserve the little existing protection that they have but also get greater protection for their right to work in their own profession in their own country, they should not only vote this Government out of office but actively come out and support Australian Labor Party candidates at the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has indicated its lethargy and inaction and I warn all those who are engaged in the television industry - actors, writers, producers and technicians - that if this Government is returned to office the very little protection that they now have can well be dissipated after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am aware of the situation which has developed in Victoria concerning the difficulty of the Commonwealth Police in apprehending  Mr Johnston  and of the fact that he is to be a candidate at an <span class="highlight">election</span> and that certain responsible persons or persons who hold high office in the Australian Labor Party are prepared to conduct a campaign on his behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#debate-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But this is a question which 1 am sure has absolutely no foundation in the sense that only a period of 5 days has elapsed since the Queensland <span class="highlight">election</span> and the question imputes, on the part of a government which has been returned, action which no responsible government in this country would undertake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This distortion is part of a thoroughly dishonest campaign which will be carried out during the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The proposal was announced first in October 1969 - perhaps honourable senators will recall that this was just prior to the last Federal general <span class="highlight">election</span> - as a political gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The matter was left to lie without a great deal of activity until the Government, which is again approaching political annihilation in another Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, increased the original vote of $3m to $8m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should not be made a political plaything of the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government every time there is an impending <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should this country be unfortunate enough to see the present Government returned to office in October or November this year, 1 could almost bet my last dollar, without any increase in Parliamentary salary, that the question of the Institute of Marine Science will again go into limbo and be raised only at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it because after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, if the Government is successful, it will cut down the vote and take away money from the Institute? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing in the relevant Act or regulations to say that a person who has been nominated as a candidate, or his company, shall not spend money to campaign for his <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720601_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let there be no mistake about it: This is a Budget designed to try to save the Government’s fortunes at the coming general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer was anxious, perhaps as an <span class="highlight">election</span> slogan, to give a brief portrayal of the Budget as he saw it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In practice, this means bigger rises in <span class="highlight">election</span> years and smaller rises at other times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the past performance of this Government is any guide, orders for expensive and flashy defence hardware, placed immediately prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, can lead to an extended financial hangover which persists long after the electoral purpose of the orders has been completed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Expedience is concerned with short term measures and the short term in this case is the 3-month period - less, I hope - between now and the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that the people of Australia should beware of Treasurers so ostentatiously bearing gifts immediately prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, enjoy the Treasurer’s gifts today for who knows what the Liberal Government might do tomorrow - that is, after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I suggest is that many Australians might dwell on it before <span class="highlight">election</span> night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are being asked to make the Budget an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Election</span> after <span class="highlight">election</span> saw the return of  Mr Menzies,  as he then was, as Prime Minister, and thereafter his 3 successors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all remember the famous cry of previous elections, particularly in 1963: Where is the money coming from?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our 1963 <span class="highlight">election</span> proposals were costed at 170m over a period of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam had ‘made a botch’ of estimating his <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that, if it is said that at <span class="highlight">election</span> time a Liberal style of government would normally use some of its influence to encourage business, there is very little encouragement in this Budget for the business community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a period of post-war rehabilitation during which there were acute shortages of goods in Australia, and any government that won <span class="highlight">election</span> in  1949  was assured .of being returned because it was basking in the glory and the efficiency of a buoyant economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This state continued until  1961 -  an <span class="highlight">election</span> year when there were  135,000  unemployed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a Budget designed to restore the economy and solve the unemployment position and to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I  do not think anyone disputes the fact that the general public believes that it is a Budget designed to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In order to win an <span class="highlight">election</span> there have been handouts to every section of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We must remember that possibly less than 10 per cent of the electors decide an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to the question of the Budget winning votes, if the unemployment position was markedly reduced by the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> some people might accept the fact that the Government knew what it was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the imminence of the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> at which members of the House of Representative and a  Senator will  spend and have spent on their behalf considerable sums of money exceeding the statutory limit of $500 as prescribed by the Electoral Act, and in view of the necessity to make a statutory declaration which, according to the Electoral Act, is false if the sum spent on behalf of members and candidates exceeds $500, when can the Government be expected to bring in legislation amending the Electoral Act which will remove this embarrassing ambiguity and thus clear candidates from the obvious charge of perjury? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister representing for the Interior disclose whether, in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1969 and the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1970 there were any known breaches of section 147 and the associated schedules of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which require the furnishing of statutory returns of electoral expenses with respect to the following: disclosure of excess expenditure above the figure prescribed by law; detecting of understatement of moneys expended by candidates, parties or organisations in the interests of candidates; failure to submit returns as required by law? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister make available a schedule of returns submitted in relation to the aforementioned elections, giving details of the contents of returns submitted by all candidates; by parties or organisations which have expended money in the interests of candidates within the definition of 147 of the Act; and by newspapers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless should any Minister take that to heart he has time to resign his portfolio between today and <span class="highlight">election</span> day, which will probably be Christmas Eve - the same day of the year as that on which the last cyclone struck north Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, the Government has been in power for 2 decades and it is only when it faces the crisis of a declining vote in a national <span class="highlight">election</span> that it has suddenly been able to find money for a number of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720824_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Quite apart from the serious consequences of revaluation to the primary, mining and secondary industries and unemployment, is it not an act of  surpreme  irresponsibility and reckless ill judgment for a party leader, a few months prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, to foreshadow the possibility of a currency revaluation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The simple answer to this is that no government can allow the legitimate business of the country to stagnate simply because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is approaching. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Budget will solve nothing, despite the attempts of its framers to ease somewhat the taxation problems facing the average man, despite attempts to increase pensions, despite endeavours to provide subsidies to those in need, despite attempts  to  improve the lot of students in secondary and tertiary establishments and despite many of the other gimmicks which are characteristics of this <span class="highlight">election</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least it is rather significant that in <span class="highlight">election</span> years some very good promises are always made by the existing government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would suggest that many of the pensioners say: Thank God for <span class="highlight">election</span> years’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one goes back and examines the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises that are made and what is done in relation to budgets in non-<span class="highlight">election</span> years one can see quite well that the only time the people in the lower income bracket receive anything from the Government is in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government kicks them in the teeth for 2 years and gives them a hand out at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with  Senator Cavanagh,  I do not think they have accepted it on this occasion and that is one reason why I said a few moments ago that I believe the <span class="highlight">election</span> will not be held until November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say merely that the Prime Minister has no intention, in my opinion, of holding an <span class="highlight">election</span> before November because there is an event coming off on which he wants to make history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be unrealistic to expect  Mr Whitlam  in his Budget speech not to look towards the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720829_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If recommendations cannot be made before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, what guarantee have the people of Australia that the recommendations by Professor Henderson will be carried out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government give a firm assurance now that the recommendations made by Professor Henderson will be implemented, and that this long-needed inquiry will not be used as an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick by a desperate government on the eve of dismissal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand from the answer the Minister gave to my earlier question about the inquiry into poverty that he believes that no report can be expected until after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister explain how the Prime Minister was able to say on the ‘AM’ programme this morning that an interim report on the basic issues of poverty was expected before the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to my <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate I was urging on various committees 2 things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be interesting to see after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> how Western Australia starts to get on the move once again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Western Australia returns to good government, as it will after the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>, we will then have the same type of situation that we had in 1959 where in a period of 12 months Western Australia went from a State on the verge of bankruptcy and a State that had made no progress whatever to a situation which resulted in the greatest progress in any period of its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Opposition’s point of view this is obviously an <span class="highlight">election</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal has been said to the effect that the Budget is good merely because this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not have much appreciation or much regard for a government that did not have enough sense to bring in a good Budget in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are grateful that, even if this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year, a number of people has been given something of which they are in need and which they will appreciate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Budget will gain considerable public support for the Government when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Government can remedy this serious Budget omission by making a firm commitment in its <span class="highlight">election</span> programme to increase substantially in the next budget child endowment payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hope that the failure to increase child endowment will be remedied before the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, as I would assume, we are successful at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> I would not be at all surprised to see the means test go by the board very smartly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather significant that in this <span class="highlight">election</span> year  Senator Hannan  and other Liberal senators, including  Senator Greenwood,  have concentrated their attack on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In commenting on the issues of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, because these arc <span class="highlight">election</span> issues, I would say that most people in the community realise that the Budget which has been brought down by this Government is an <span class="highlight">election</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the years that have preceded this <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government has generally put the brakes on the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it believes in the sorts of things it is putting up at this <span class="highlight">election</span> such as social welfare, the need to control overseas investment and the need to plan the economy, why has it not done these things during those 23 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one  who  is proud to be a member of the Government earn and as one who I firmly believe will be contesting an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the next few months,I proudly support the measures that have been promised and that  I  know most surely will be implemented in a short space of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are facts which cannot be disputed, and I am quite sure they will be revealed further during the coming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in my State as well as perhaps throughout the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Australian Labor Party have said that they consider that this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an Independent I think the Labor Party would like to be in the same position, if this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> Budget, and produce a similar one because in my opinion it is a very good Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be unrealistic to expect  Mr Whitlam  in his Budget speech not to look towards the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That arises from Gough’s <span class="highlight">election</span> van which, having for a year or so careered recklessly all over the community without Ralph Nader’s approval, like the second hand car in the television advertisement, distributing <span class="highlight">election</span> promises right and left is now falling to pieces as the sheer weight of public opinion focuses upon the stream of policies which now have no legs with which to run, and as the force of the alternative budget and the value of our promises leave it for dead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those issues are divided into one of 2 classes, either those that it knows are right and yet are opposed in its own platform and therefore should be opposed - in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year it will not oppose them but will remain silent - and those that it would want to commend but will not because it is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I made the remarks that I made, lt would be utter nonsense to suggest that for this Senate or for any political party at <span class="highlight">election</span> time- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that this Senate committee may well go on past the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are its policies going to be sub judice now and after the <span class="highlight">election</span> if we hold matters in relation to the Senate committee on ice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have been engaged in a debate on the Budget and we are facing an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the near future at a lime when the threat to the Government is the greatest it has ever been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of I he Broadcasting and Television Act written into the Act, in the first instance, by the Chifley Government as a result of the John Austral series of radio broadcasts which were radio dramatisations of political events connected with an <span class="highlight">election</span> and deliberately designed to influence the results of a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the television programme ‘Our Man in Canberra’ a comedy or satirical programme designed for general entertainment and nol designed to deliberately influence the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister further tell us: Is there no limit to the efforts by this Government to traduce the trade union movement in this country, which has a legitimate place under law, just because it thinks it can obtain some advantage from this in the few weeks preceding a general <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have some relevance, when the <span class="highlight">election</span> comes around, to know precisely the view of the Australian Labor Party on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It raises the very real question - it may be in the <span class="highlight">election</span> con tex to which  Senator Georges  and other Labor Party senators have referred - of how much credence can be placed upon what  Mr Whitlam  says and his ability to persuade the governing bodies of his own organisation to give effect to what he says, because this is one clear example of his being out of step with his own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no more than 2 months, I suppose, we will go to the <span class="highlight">election</span> hustings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His remark reminds me of a statement made some years ago by a former senior Minister when it was alleged at an <span class="highlight">election</span> time that there was a nest of traitors in the Department of Foreign Affairs, but as soon as the <span class="highlight">election</span>  was over we  heard nothing more about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is  there this sudden  attack  2$  or perhaps  3  months before  an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the Government has woken up to the tremendous influence the programme has had, is having and is likely to have on the Australian people during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people will be looking to the programme, bearing in mind the tightness of control of the mass media generally, for an independent assessment of the political complexities and arguments that will arise during the course of the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, out of the Government’s ‘resubmit at <span class="highlight">election</span> time’ file we heard yesterday about an article in the Communist Party newspaper ‘Tribune’ of 3rd June 1 970- -something that was written more than  2i  years ago and which no-one in the Senate bothered to mention until a mere  2i  months before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These things were trotted out of the Government’s ‘smear at <span class="highlight">election</span> time’ file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With reference to the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, I asked the PostmasterGeneral:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This attack which has been launched against members of the current affairs programme This Day Tonight’ is designed deliberately to destroy in the minds of the Australian people the credibility of the ABC a mere 2 months before an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that it has done so because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is soon to be held and never before has the Government been led by such a disaster as its present Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to make a prediction, but from talks I have had with supporters of the Liberal Party throughout Australia I would not be surprised if, should the present Liberal-Country Party Government be returned to office at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, which is a possibility,  Mr McMahon  were to be Prime Minister for only another year before being kicked upstairs to the position of Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not prepared to put its foot down about anything because it thinks that its action might affect votes at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nonsensical that members of the Australian Country Party and those who hold seats in electorates verging on country areas are so scared about the possibility of not retaining their seats at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> that they are prepared to sell their souls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say straight away that this is almost certain to occur after the general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to add my personal regret that, owing to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Republic of Singapore was not able to send delegates and, 1 8827/72- iS-  [26]  for other reasons, delegates from the British Solomon Islands were unable to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a clear commitment by the Government, and when the Government is returned at the <span class="highlight">election</span> it will be in a position to give some indication of the date on which the legislation to give effect to that objective can be brought in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was closed in order to store up something so that when the Budget came along in this <span class="highlight">election</span> year - of course, this is good politics but it does not keep people in work and it did not keep pensioners with food in their larders - the Government was able to take off the locks with this Budget and come up with something which it hoped would appeal to the electors at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will see about that when the <span class="highlight">election</span> results are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With an <span class="highlight">election</span> probably hingeing on public reaction to the document which the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  delivered last night, the Government has placed all its eggs in two baskets: income taxes and pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What’s the value of a politician’s word in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it is <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it being saved to be used as another <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick so that the Government can come along, like Santa Claus, in the policy speech and say: “Yes, we are going to abolish the wine tax”?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I well remember that at the height of the Vietnam war in 1969  Senator Jessop  and a couple of his colleagues in the other place lost their seats at the <span class="highlight">election</span> because of their policy on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had the present Commonwealth Government not been using the communist bogey as an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue year after year and created bad relations with Communist China, as it termed that country in those days- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we become the government and as soon as the <span class="highlight">election</span> has been held this will be one of the first things that we will look to, because we believe in getting the people out of the cities to where they can have a decent living without having to travel for li hours each day in order to get to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thank the honourable senator for reminding me because I now want to tell the Senate that immediately on the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a federal Labor government we are going to release all pol itical prisoners who have committed a breach of the so-called National Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing would please me more and nothing would please the Australian Labor Party more than for the <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing would please the people of Australia more than to have a quick <span class="highlight">election</span> and nothing would serve the nation better than a change of government, which will be the inevitable result of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is now some doubt that there  will  be an early  <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So the Prime Minister is now dilly-dallying He has refused to declare when an <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear that the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be postponed until the latest possible moment because no time is suitable for the Government to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> and no time is suitable for the Prime Minister to face the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But these are arrangements which have been made by a Government which faces an <span class="highlight">election</span> in complete disarray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720912_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are witnessing one of the great historical occasions in this country at a time when honourable senators opposite are afraid of some political implications at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that this is going to affect the <span class="highlight">election</span> one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a matter on which the <span class="highlight">election</span> will turn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these things combine to make them eminently capable of understanding what is involved in casting a vote at a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from those facts, it is quite absurd to have 18, 19 and 20-year-olds voting at some elections and not at others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that the Council fully supported the action proposed at the time by the Australian Labor Party and the Australia Party in seeking to take legal action to force the vote for 18-year-olds in this year’s Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the eve of the 1969 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the former Prime Minister,  Mr Gorton,  said that he believed that 18-year-olds would be able to vote at this year’s poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> he indicated his expectation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet these people are barred from sharing in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of those who will make the decisions that affect their lives in nearly every way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party firmly believes that we ought to do in this country what has been done in the United States of America and the United Kingdom and allow our people to vote at 18 years of age as the citizens of Papua New Guinea voted at 18 in the <span class="highlight">election</span> held earlier this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope that those who have indicated their support for this principle - members of the Government parties in this chamber and of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, if it adheres to its conference decision of several years ago - will support this measure.I hope that the legislation will be given a speedy passage and that it will be introduced before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No-one has been told when the’ <span class="highlight">election</span> is likely to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament is entitled to know and not to be treated to some kind of cat and mouse game arising out of weakness and inability to state firmly when the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held, so that the 2 Houses of the Parliament may act in  a  responsible and sensible way to determine the programming of their business and to see to it that the matters which ought properly to be dealt with are dealt with and that legislation is prop erly dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘period of sittings’ be deleted and that the following words be inserted: be considered after the Prime Minister h:is announced the <span class="highlight">election</span> date for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, unless otherwise ordered, the days and times of meeting of the Senate for the remainder of the present period of sittings be considered after the Prime Minister has announced the <span class="highlight">election</span> date for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My own feeling is there is not any urgency to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The longer we take in getting to the <span class="highlight">election</span> date the better it will be for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the good aspects of the Budget and because people are more satisfied in their minds about the situation in Australia a later <span class="highlight">election</span> must all be to the benefit of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators have a right to be told when it is disclosed by the person whose prerogative it is to determine the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a Premier of a State and it was my own prerogative as it is the undisputable right of the leader of a government, to determine the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span> and to disclose it when he believes the time is propitious and in the best interests of the workings of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, in the ordinary circumstances and following history, elections have been held here in the first week of December; they have also been held in the month of November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strongest argument for what the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate is putting forward tonight is that he is desirous of dealing with the business of the Senate as expeditiously as possible in the event of the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> being announced which would terminate this session earlier than would normally be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave out all words after ‘period of sittings’, insert ‘be considered after the Prime Minister has announced the <span class="highlight">election</span> date for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Acting Leader of the Government is showing some vision, foresight and precaution in trying to get additional working time in which to dispose of all the business which is ahead of us before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of this year or at about that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an additional reason this year, because pf a pending <span class="highlight">election</span>, to sit extra hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>None of us can dispute the right of the Prime Minister to determine the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is his right and his right alone to determine the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in making that decision he will consult those whom he believes he should consult in deciding on the time when the Government should submit itself to its masters at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have been associated with politics will know how frequently in the past we have been able to point to Prime Ministers who have kept secret and close to their hearts the date of a pending <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How frequently has the date that has been announced been unexpected, and how frequently have elections been held prematurely when the average person in the community has not expected an <span class="highlight">election</span> for at least another 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hate mentioning this, but as a former Premier of a State I know that we would decide the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span> and would have regard to many factors in arriving at a date which we believed would be convenient for the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would avoid having an <span class="highlight">election</span> on a Saturday preceding a Monday that was a holiday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would try to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> on a date when we had available to us the services of schoolteachers and others as presiding officers, poll clerks and other personnel who are indispensable to the proper conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us support the proposal advanced by the Acting Leader of the Government, get our heads down to work and clear the sheets of the business paper as much as possible so that we will be ready in the event of an <span class="highlight">election</span> being called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has proposed an amendment in the terms read out by  Senator Gair  suggesting that a decision on extended sitting hours be postponed until after the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> has been announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally speaking we have about 7 or 8 weeks notice of an <span class="highlight">election</span> and that period allows some ambit into which we would be able to fit the business that we are required to deal with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With all due respect to  Senator Gair,  arguing the point about seeking the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> is secondary to dealing with the backlog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just because there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the offing is not an excuse for any Minister to delay a long overdue deputation or a long overdue reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter when <span class="highlight">election</span> day is, 1 would like to believe that when we are here the parliamentary machine is churning out decisions or that as a committee we can interrogate top departmental officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 take  Senator Gair  up on one point - that it is the righof the leader of a government to set the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a set time for a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, unless the government is defeated on the floor of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the matter could be resolved conveniently by determining that the <span class="highlight">election</span> shall be held at a particular time so that all organisational matters in relation to the <span class="highlight">election</span> can be attended to properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure him and  Senator Gair  that if they were to determine that the <span class="highlight">election</span> should be held in 3 weeks’ time we would be prepared to sit each day of the week each week for as many hours as arc required to finish the business of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that the alteration of sitting hours should be postponed until we know more definitely when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is likely to be is a reasonable one and I think it should be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Gair  said, in the event of a decision being made that the <span class="highlight">election</span> should be held before the 12-week sitting period has elapsed, we would avoid that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely those men and women who have comprised the standing committees and who have worked so hard, compiled reports and presented them to the Senate do not want the Senate to rise and an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held without some discussion having taken place on those reports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would go further than that and say that I could not see Premier Tonkin, Premier Dunstan or Premier Reece telling the world 6 months, 4 months or even 2 months beforehand when they were to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are enlightening, and &lt; I think the people of Australia will show at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> the result of this enlightenment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are being dealt with in this way because of some panic, some hysterical reaction which I believe is not helping this Government, even in its party political interests or in its <span class="highlight">election</span> prospects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is consistent with what the Government has been doing for a long time, and that is one of the reasons why the Government will be destroyed at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe this is because a general <span class="highlight">election</span> is in the offing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may be wrong, but I think the approach which the Labor Party adopted in less impassioned days when an <span class="highlight">election</span> was far more distant was a far more reasonable approach to adopt than its present approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But because of the gerrymander which existed in that State for many years, we were not able to form a government until  Mr Steele  Hall, who believes in electoral justice, introduced an electoral redistribution after the 1968 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to put on record that after the redistribution took place in South Australia the Labor Party received less votes at the 1970 <span class="highlight">election</span> than it received at the 1968 <span class="highlight">election</span> when it could not win the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the fact that teaching staff, school committees and parents associations throughout Australia are desirous of making firm arrangements for the end of year school functions and that these arrangements necessitate the booking in advance of halls and in many cases school buildings, which will be required for use as polling booths, will the Minister request the Prime Minister to make an early announcement of the <span class="highlight">election</span> date so that the people and organisations I have mentioned can complete their arrangements? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the present escalating prices being received for wool are conditioned hy a shortage of wool in world pipelines, a swing away from synthetics to some extent and back to wool, manipulators and futures marketeers on the world wool buying scene and the impending Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1949 <span class="highlight">election</span> was fought on a number of issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The leader of the newly formed Liberal Party that was successful in that <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Menzies,  obviously still had a social conscience because he promised on that occasion that his Government would abolish the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As that was part of the social services policy of the Government elected at that <span class="highlight">election</span> one would have thought that there would have been considerable movement towards abolition of the means test or towards establishing a national superannuation .scheme by the enactment of a national insurance bill as a matter of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then the apostles of doom came on the scene and have been on the scene at every <span class="highlight">election</span> subsequently when the Labor Party has endeavoured to do what the Liberal Party said it would do when it stated its platform in 1946, 1947, 1948 and those early years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then of the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> when, it must surely be admitted by Government spokesmen and defenders of Government policy, the tide is running very heavily against the Government - if we are to take cognisance of public opinion polls - a rabbit is pulled out of the hat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not been until the Government has been hard pressed in respect to contesting the 1972 general <span class="highlight">election</span> that it has seen fit to take any meaningful steps towards recognising the unfairness of the means test to aged and invalid persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I can say at this juncture is: Thank God that this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year, because there is no way in the world that this Government would have paid any of these benefits in some oases, and there is no way in the world that it would have paid more than 25 per cent in those fields where it could not dodge responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720926_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Where, under the Constitution, a State is entitled to more representatives than are provided for under the divisions which have taken place - those divisions being applicable at present - we should know what should be done in respect of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in order that that State may have its full entitlement in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There could well be a close division in the political representation in another Parliament as occurred after the 1961 and 1969 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Why has noindication been given by the Government as to when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this childish approach to the programming of Parliament has gone on long enough and the Parliament is entitled to be told when the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held and what the programme is for the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would expect that in Australia, as well as in other countries, it would be the only intelligent approach to such an affair of state, instead of this behaviour which I have described as infantile, this cat and mouse behaviour with regard to the <span class="highlight">election</span> date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I suggest, in view of his motion, that it is time this nonsense was stopped and the Parliament and people were told the projected date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> so that we may determine a proper programme for the conduct of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy’s  argument is based on pure supposition that there may be an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem to be a rather curious procedure for such a Bill to be introduced into the Senate within a matter of weeks of the rolls closing for a general <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be borne in mind that we are involved in an <span class="highlight">election</span> only for that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The logical approach would be to proceed with caution and to take into consideration questions which need to be taken into account rather than to impose upon young people a responsibility just prior to a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, section 41 of the Constitution provides that no adult person who has or acquires a right to vote at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State shall, while the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for either of the Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, lowering of the franchise age would increase considerably the number of potential electors in each electoral division throughout the Commonwealth and I am sure it would be quite obvious to honourable senators that even if this Bill became law very little, if any, time at all would be available for the newly enfranchised persons to secure enrolment for the coming House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators would well know, with all their experience, that the rolls close at 6 p.m. on the day of the issue of the writs and only those persons whose claims are received by the electoral registrar up to that time may be enrolled for the purpose of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus it would seem to be that in practice we would have virtually a voluntary enrolment situation for 18 to 20 year olds for the coming House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> lt could not be compulsory; it would have to be voluntary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to realise that a change to give 18 year olds a voce at the coming <span class="highlight">election</span> would, if there was a large influx of claims for enrolment immediately prior to the close of the rolls, impose very great extra pressure upon the electoral administration in expeditiously producing the final rolls made up to the issue of the writs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has to be considered if one wants to have a transmission of a voter’s intent into a situation of reality in a parliamentary <span class="highlight">election</span> scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the extension of the franchise to young people of the age of 18 years and under 21 years will provide for a more accurate reflection of the relevant opinion of electors the most accurate and democratic means of ensuring the equitable Parliamentary representation in the House of Representatives of substantial bodies of political opinion in the community is by the electoral system of proportional representation voting for <span class="highlight">election</span> to that House; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the deposit of a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to either House should be reduced to $30 or alternatively the voting percentage requirement for the return of a deposit to an unsuccessful candidate should be lowered’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, then it is realistic that such young people if they exhibit these qualities and accept these responsibilities should be given the greater responsibility - perhaps the greater duty - of participating in the government of their country by the use of the electoral process, by the exercise of the franchise in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of governments and, therefore, in the control of the national destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no definitive opinion on this and there cannot be until they are actually tested at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only recently we have found the Australia Party, in areas where it has put up a candidate at an <span class="highlight">election</span>, obtaining a rather significant fraction of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Senate general <span class="highlight">election</span> on 22nd November 1958 the Democratic Labor Party received 387,792 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result of that tremendous vote the DLP returned one member to the Senate, although it had polled 8.41 per cent of the aggregate vote at that Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal-Country Party received 2 million votes or 44 per cent of the vote and its candidates were successful in winning 15 scats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures 1 have in front of me are for the Senate general <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a look at what happened in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1967 the DLP received 540,000 votes or 9.77 per cent of the vote and obtained 2 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the history of the Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the figures more illustrative of the proposition I am putting are those for House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the House of Representatives general <span class="highlight">election</span> on 30th November 1963 the Democratic Labor Party received 407,416 votes or 7.4 per cent of the total and obtained no seats at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same <span class="highlight">election</span> - I repeat that I am not being critical of it - the Country Party received 489,000 votes or about 82,000 votes more than the Democratic Labor Party and obtained 20 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1966 the Country Party received 561,000 votes and obtained 21 seats; the Democratic Labor Party received 417,411 votes but obtained no seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was held in 1969, the DLP received 367,977 votes and obtained no seats at all, whereas the Country Party had the usual record in relation to its vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the most accurate and democratic means of ensuring the equitable Parliamentary representation in the House of Representatives of substantial bodies of political opinion in the community is by the electoral system of proportional representation voting for <span class="highlight">election</span> to that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way this amendment is framed does not, to my mind, suggest an alteration of the Electoral Act for a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion the Senate cannot wisely pass this Bill at this stage when it knows, even if  Senator Murphy  did not listen to the late news tonight, that the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be announced some time next week or the week after next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore we know that the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held in November or December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  is at liberty to bring these matters in whenever he so desires, but to expect support from this side of the chamber for what is obviously a phoney <span class="highlight">election</span> stunt is far too much for anybody to swallow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720928_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The general <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives will be held on Saturday, 2nd December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Senate is entitled to know what is, in the opinion of the legal advisers of the Commonwealth, the constitutional position in relation to the representation of Western Australia and whether, in fact, one more representative should be elected at large from that State or whether some other method needs to be adopted in order that the requirements of the Constitution can be met in relation to this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event that there are inescapable reasons why the Senate should not continue to operate even in a nonlegislative role pending the calling of the newly elected House of Representatives, will you ascertain whether it is the will of the Senate that Parliament should be called as soon as practicable after the return of the writs for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the House of Representatives so that the Senate committees can proceed with their processes of investigation and report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the approaching termination of the session, which will be followed by a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, can the Minister give an assurance that a greater effort will be made to provide answers to the many important questions which have been on the notice paper in my case for almost 2 months and in other cases going back to December 1971, especially since procuring these answers would not appear to involve a great amount of effort or research in many instances? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721011_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator O’Byrne  refers to officials, it should be known that this man was a Labor candidate in the Tasmanian State <span class="highlight">election</span> last year and, following that campaign, was reinstated as the producer of this current affairs programme in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that the Government does not intend that the franchise will be lowered before the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> cannot be construed as opposition in principle to a lowered franchise age; rather the Government takes the view that the time and the circumstances are not appropriate to bring about such a major change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Senator Murphy’s  suggestion was introduced in England, I know that Labor people here and in London said that the Labor Party would win the <span class="highlight">election</span> because of the 18-year-old voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am quite sure that  Senator Little  will accord with that view because his Party, the Democratic Labor Party, is represented  in the Senate whereas although the percentage of votes it gains at each <span class="highlight">election</span> would normally entitle it to some representation in the House of Representatives if that chamber were a truly representative assembly, it has no representation there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first is the timing of the Bill and its impact on the forthcoming general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we know, a general <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on 2nd December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have, presumably, the situation where some people between the ages of 18 and 21 years, if they were speedy in their actions, would have the right to vote at the <span class="highlight">election</span>, but there would be no obligation upon every person between the ages of 18 and 21 years to enrol because the Electoral Act at present provides for a period of 3 months within which a person, after attaining the age of 21 years, may enrol before he commits the offence of failing to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, as I recall the figures quoted by  Senator Cotton  when this Bill was last before the chamber and the ones 1 have seen elsewhere, approximately 9,000 out of a total of 55,000 eligible 18 to 20- year-olds in South Australia have enrolled for the purpose of voting in elections in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 was indicating that if the Bill were to become law the anomalous situation would exist - just because of the practicalities of the situation - where there would be conferred upon some people aged between 18 and 21 years a right to vote at the forthcoming general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I believe, simply because of the timing of this Bill and the impact it would have on the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>, that it is undesirable that the Senate should give it a second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But somewhere between 90 per cent and 98 per cent of all those eligible to vote at an <span class="highlight">election</span> always vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many people over the age of 21 years who in terms of comprehension of what our voting system is concerned with, and in terms of ability and intelligence to make the type of judgment that we would like to see people make at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, are not equipped to make that sort of judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, will the Government remove 2 irritating restrictions upon radio broadcasting and television imposed upon these media many ages ago by a dying Labor administration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Minister will not go as far as that, does he realise that half way through the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign a blanket of silence on Federal matters will descend upon the media in Australia’s most densely populated areas because of a State by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister inform the Senate whether arrangements have been made and whether all Australians on the bases will be able to cast a vote at the general <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held on 2nd December 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721017_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government give an undertaking that the Commission shall be completely unbridled in the presentation of all current affairs programming during the course of the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> compaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior whether he is now in a position to indicate to the Senate that it can anticipate amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to enlarge absentee voting facilities for the pending national <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this will not be possible due to the need to dissolve the House of Representatives in the near future as a prelude to the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, although the Committee would hope to make its report to the Senate very early  in the new Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also indicated that, after the general <span class="highlight">election</span>, I proposed calling the Standing Orders Committee together to examine these and related matters over a period of at least a week for the purpose of making some recommendations to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have made our position clear to the Parliament, and the Senate has made its position clear to the Government, and we trust that the Government, will make its position clear to the people who will vote at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the honourable senator that the position will be changed radically upon the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a government of another complexion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it has implemented a lot of new ideas and propositions on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> but there has been no indication whatever - apart from the lowering of the threshold for the payment of estate duty, probate duty, death duty and gift duty - that the Government is disposed to accept the resolution which was passed by this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 suppose that people who happen to be listening to this debate will not be under any illusion that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is coming on shortly and that what they have been listening to tonight have been the preliminaries of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason Opposition senators are in a rather invidious position tonight when, for electioneering purposes, they are posing as the friends of those who may suffer from estate duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In normal circumstances we could do that, if we had plenty of time ahead of us, but the sittings of the Senate will end next week or the week after for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gets the opportunity once in 6 years to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to represent his completely insignificant party in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all he said that this is an electioneering matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Senator Negus  is not standing for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year, because  Sir William  Big Ears and all of the people behind him are struggling, they decided there was some political mileage in this and they crossed the Senate floor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite thought that they had the <span class="highlight">election</span> in the bag. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I were advising the Attorney-General on how to conduct his campaign in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>, I would suggest to him that the less he says about law and order the better it will be for his Party, because we have seen something of the record of this Government on law and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I prophesy to you,  Mr President,  that this <span class="highlight">election</span> will have come and gone and there will have been no prosecution of persons responsible for the bombing outrages in Sydney; there will have been no statement by the Attorney-General; there will have been no effort to mobilise the forces of the Commonwealth to see that these people are prosecuted and to see that this sort of thing is prevented from happening in the future.I make that prediction now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Australia has to be very concerned if  Senator Greenwood  continues after the next federal <span class="highlight">election</span> to occupy the exalted position that he presently occupies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After  Senator Primmer  and  Senator Poyser  had spoken, his opening remark on this matter was that it was not surprising that members of the Australian Labor Party who had a candidate running for a scat in Victoria at the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> who was In defiance of the National Service Act should be raising this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that this evening  Senator Greenwood  would have done the same in regard to  Mrs McLean  rather than say cheaply and nastily that she has gone to gaol not only to give the ALP a voice in the Parliament against the National Service Act but also so that the whole question of the American alliance, the ANZUS Pact, Vietnam and things of this nature can be raised in the Parliament just prior to the holding of a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Johnson for the courage of his convictions is that it is being realised by this Government that if it had to fight an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue of conscription alone it would be annihilated overwhelmingly at the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know full well that there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 2nd December and that there will be a dissolution of the House of Representatives on 2nd November, which necessitates an earlier closure of the Senate than normally would be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This too is a waste of time and whether or not the Government adjourns taking a vote on it until after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the vote still has to be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is being done on the eve of a federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in a manner similar to the agreement which was entered into between this Government and Ansett Airlines of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This gives one more year after the <span class="highlight">election</span> for adjustments to be made within the respective schools and systems and for the Australian schools commission to be established. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the outcome of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December - it will not matter which party is in office after then - the Government will have to balance health, education, defence and many other issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We should not have to let things drift on for 5 or 10 years until maybe 3 months before an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not enough is done about physical education and no matter what happens after the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December, more money must be spent to make this a healthier nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a crisis which has grown up over  23  years of this Government and now, on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, something is being done about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is natural on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> and with a dual system of education and because of the events that have gone before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721019_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of these comments can the Minister tell us whether it is his view that the doctors intend to increase fees substantially straight after the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might say that when the Minister is forced out of this chamber at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and has to go back to his legal practice he may be looking for some of this work to sustain him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are members of the Australian bases in the Antarctic seldom given the opportunity to vote in Australian elections; if so, will the Minister take immediate action to institute appropriate measures to ensure that provisions are made for all eligible persons stationed in the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> for Members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was noi present during the second reading debate on this Bil] because I wanted to speak at length on it, but 1 would like the Minister to give the Committee an assurance, if he can, that prior to the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government will not just go ahead and appoint the commissioners or the other people at the top of this Corporation and so tie the hands of a future government after 2nd December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think this should awaken the electors of Australia to what they can expect as the Campaign gets under way; that is, that small portions of statements by Labor members will be used to bolster up the Budget on which this Government hopes to win the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The opinion I was expressing was the opinion of the industry itself that the Minister may appoint these members before the 1972 general <span class="highlight">election</span> and then, should there be a change of government, there would be no way except by expiration of time - in one instance, 5 years; and in another, 3 years - by which those members could be replaced by the new government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President, there is shortly to be a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepted this view and on 20th September last the Minister for Defence announced that no-one would be disadvantaged by participating in the new scheme; that everybody would have a right of <span class="highlight">election</span> to ensure that by participating he would not be disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721026_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think this aspect may be discussed further when we return after the recess and <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill lapsed when the House was dissolved in 1969 for the genera) <span class="highlight">election</span> held in that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to  Senator Greenwood,  who is in charge of the estimates now before the Committee, that if the report has not been presented to the Parliament - I am practically certain that it has not been - steps should be immediately taken to ensure that that report is presented to the Senate before the Senate adjourns for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the right of <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Commonwealth Advertising Council is restricted, in the first instance, to those who have done work for and on behalf of the Commonwealth in the preceding 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First,  I  notice that the Bill seeks to amend the National Health Act which would, in normal circumstances, provide to the Senate a very wide ambit for discussing the whole ramifications of the Government’s health scheme and the proposals that will be submitted to the people by the Australian Labor Party in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On special occasions such as <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, the selection of Press representatives is generally determined by the capacity of the aircraft and the VIP’s nomination, having regard to the number of news services desiring representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721027_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am unable to say what the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has said regarding the Charlestown by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, butI would have thought that it is absolutely clear that as far as the Charlestown by-<span class="highlight">election</span> is concerned, which will occur on18th November, the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act would prevent the broadcasting of any <span class="highlight">election</span> matter relating to that <span class="highlight">election</span> between midnight on Wednesday, 15th November, and the close of the poll on the following Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will recall that in 1969 an amendment was passed to the relevant section of the Broadcasting and Television Act which indicated that the Board had a function whereby it could exempt from the generality of the provisions those broadcasting and television stations whose programmes would not be received in the area where an <span class="highlight">election</span> was being held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Government in 1969 insert into the Act section 116 (4a) which provides for exemptions for stations that do not transmit into an area which is the subject of a particular <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the PostmasterGeneral on 12th October 1970 advise the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters that despite numerous representations made to him the Government had decided at that time not to pursue any amendment to section 1 1 6 which would completely lift the restriction on the broadcasting of electoral matter from midnight on the Wednesday preceding an <span class="highlight">election</span> until after the poll closed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the PostmasterGeneral made a statement about the matter on 12th October 1970 is unknown to me, but the Government’s policy is that the period between midnight on the Wednesday preceding the polling day and the close of the poll on the Saturday under our law is a period in which no <span class="highlight">election</span> matter may be broadcast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undoubtedly when the history of our country is written it will be recalled that the 1949 <span class="highlight">election</span> was a disaster so far as Australia was concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the most significant things the Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon,  could do to ensure his re-<span class="highlight">election</span> later this year would be to make it clear he appreciates the problem of the ‘cities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Parliament had not met for 9 months and as a State <span class="highlight">election</span> was imminent the matter had to be raised somewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he made some general observations interlarded with the comment that at the end of the year, after the <span class="highlight">election</span> has taken place, there will be a new type of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has this promise from me that if his Party wins the <span class="highlight">election</span> I will buy him a dinner with a limit of S15 that he can eat his way through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure it was the realisation of this that prompted  Mr Gorton  in the 1970 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to say on 4th November - almost 2 years ago - at the Malvern Town Hall:  1 now announce  a  new objective to which we give very high priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is therefore somewhat surprising that at the end of the parliamentary session, in one of the last dozen Bills to be passed through this House - it was one of the last Bills to be passed through the House of Representatives - we should be seeking to bring into effect a promise that was made during the 1970 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that this Bill is but another piece of pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda such as we have seen in recent times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Government’s initiative - hardly the right word - is designed as nothing more than a vote catcher in the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Judging by the provisions of the Bill the shortage will last for many years if this Government is returned at the <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We might find an <span class="highlight">election</span> by many Australian women - who work purely for economic reasons - to stay in the home if a home care allowance were provided for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721030_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of whether it is the Government’s fault or not that this mess has occurred which prevents the Leader of the Country Party from having his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech broadcast in metropolitan areas, surely the democratic process ought to permit him to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, will the Government consider the possibility of introducing into this place legislation which will operate from a period prior to the commencement of the general <span class="highlight">election</span> with the understanding from all sides that such legislation would be enacted in both Houses, if required, after the elections and that it would have retrospective effect in order that we may find a common sense approach and permit the democratic process to operate as it should? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme represents the fulfilment of a Government pledge during the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1970 that legislation of this character would be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not for a moment suggest that these amendments are brought in here purely to give an airing to the policy of the ALP in relation to this matter for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, seeing that our proceedings are being broadcast today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However much I respect  Senator Bishop  and perhaps a few other members of his Party, I say that there are many people in his Party at present making statements about an enormous number of matters which have political consequences because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is in the offing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It announced its own comprehensive Bill, which is now Labor Party policy, and the facts are that if the Labor Party wins the general <span class="highlight">election</span>, as has been announced by the shadow Minister for Labour and National Service the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  that Bill will be the basis for future legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat what the shadow Minister for Labour has said: In the event that Labor wins the <span class="highlight">election</span>, such amendments as I have moved would be put into legislative form at an early stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question which was asked was: Are we prepared to deprive workers of the increased benefits contained in this Bill until such time as Parliament resumes after the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that we are on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which the ALP almost certainly will win- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have to thank God for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> on 2nd December, because that is the only reason why these amendments are before the Senate tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is the way in which the Government is to introduce amendments into the Act, it is nothing but a hollow political sham and window dressing for the coming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first purpose is to reveal to the Senate and to the Australian public that an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise which was made by the Australian Labor Parly is not being honoured in the fullness of the terms in which it was made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an issue in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that we recognise that the Government has departed from its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise and is seeking to limit to some a benefit which it promised to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the combined effect of the determinations made by the Public Service Arbitrator and a Public Service application of those determinations, the Government is implementing a policy which is inconsistent with its stated <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday the Prime Minister was asked whether he proposed to implement the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party had the courage of what it is now doing it would have been prepared to tell the Australian people during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign it was proposing to introduce this measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that if it were done that way it would accord with the somewhat rash promise of the Labor Party to abide by openness in government, and it would also ensure that we keep the Labor Party honest and in accordance with its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> a number of unions committed very substantial funds to support the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until I had heard the cass put by the Minister for Repatriation  (Senator Bishop)  and the interjections of his supporters I had believed that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  virtually was in favour of the idea contained in  Senator Greenwood’s  proposition; that is that no restriction should be placed on an individual’s receiving the benefits of the promises made by the Prims Minister in his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign because of an ancillary matter relating to membership of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the determination is disallowed and there is not within 24 hours a measure before the Parliament in this or another place to ensure that the promises of the Prime Minister during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign are carried into effect, we are prepared to take that step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least he was trying to carry out the promise that he made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A particular party made a promise as part of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and it won the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A promise was made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and the people voted for the party which made it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament is now meeting and it is possible to extend to all people in the Public Service, by legislation, as has always been the case before, the promise made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government should give everybody in industry the advantage of the promise it has made, lt should put to one side introduction of those things that were not contained in the promises made by the Prime Minister during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  have no doubt that the Government would be able to get its proposition on leave through the other chamber because of the change that has occurred since the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somebody, I think it was  Senator Little,  complained and asked why the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  did not apply an instant interpretation and say: ‘Well, if you were not in a union before <span class="highlight">election</span> day you will not receive anything.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that the <span class="highlight">election</span> is over I can say that I am surprised that such an astute political genera] like  Senator Carrick  did not use this in the last campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it perfectly clear - in moving this motion I think  Senator Greenwood  made it perfectly clear - that the object of the motion is to get rid of a highly offensive and discriminatory decision and to point the way in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  of 4 weeks annual leave for all Commonwealth employees should be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever views we might have in regard to the principle of 4 weeks annual leave - I believe that this is something which should be determined by the industrial tribunals of this country, and I am opposed to pace setting which is practised by governments in regard to their own employees - nevertheless, we on this side of the chamber recognise that the Prime Minister made a. clear <span class="highlight">election</span> promise in this regard and that he and his Government has a clear mandate to introduce the principle of 4 weeks annual leave for Commonwealth employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There-, fore this motion and this debate are not meant to prevent the implementation of- 4 weeks annual leave but to ensure that the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise is properly carried out and applied to all Commonwealth employees, as the Prime Minister so clearly promised when he went to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within, I think, three or four days of the <span class="highlight">election</span> the then Minister for Labour apparent or presumptive or whatever one might call him at that stage,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, made it quite clear that this promise would be carried out only in relation to members of Public Service organisations and unions and would not be applied generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement was made three or four days after the <span class="highlight">election</span> and after the people had given the Labor Government a clear mandate on a specific and unambiguous promise made by the Prime Minister of 4 weeks annual leave to all Commonwealth employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious from the steps that have been taken and from the public statements that have been made by  Mr Clyde  Cameron since the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the- whole purpose of this exercise is to restrict the benefit of 4 weeks annual leave to members- of Public Service unions and organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But here we have the most naked and blatant piece of division created by the Prime Minister within days of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dealt with it already but I wish to summarise it again - is that it is in blatant contradiction of the Prime Minister’s solemn <span class="highlight">election</span> promise in unambiguous terms - nobody on the Government side of this Senate’ can get away from the clear and unambiguous words the Prime Minister used - that all Commonwealth employees will be given 4 weeks annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet not only do we have this major change in the law and the implementation of this major promise of the Prime Minister made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign carried out by regulation but also we have had many other examples of this kind of thing since 2nd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is: it that now when inflation is worse than it Was .prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> we do not hear much about it, whereas before the <span class="highlight">election</span> Labor spokesmen were forecasting the collapse of the economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister any comments to make on reports that since the federal <span class="highlight">election</span> more than 200 terrorists have left Australia to carry on their activities elsewhere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>general <span class="highlight">election</span>, was that costs., in these funds were increasing considerably and the then Government, realising that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was pending and not wanting to increase the medical and hospital fund contributions, did nut do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure whether, as a consequence of his Party’s defeat in the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Senator Greenwood  - I regret that he has left the chamber - has been chastened, which I doubt; but it is interesting to note that he now claims that he is concerned about personal freedom and freedom of the individual to make decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-71-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Democratic Labor Party supported the former government, which constantly and right up till the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>, opposed every attempt to secure 4 weeks annual leave not only by public servants but also by all other organised workers in Australia before various tribunals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-71-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So did the statement made by the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  3 days after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-71-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sympathise with the Labor Party’s dilemma because of its massive Bacchanalian over expenditure to honour promises made in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, but I look at it with some envy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the plea from white collar workers who in the main, until the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, supported the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time it is particularly noteworthy “that within 2 or 3 months of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2nd December the Senate takes the stand that the subordinate legislation that is authorised by the various Acts of this Parliament shall be scrutinised and, according to our judgment, will stand or be cancelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want a few more members’ fees so that in the pool of public service union revenues there will be a greater scum or cream to come off into the political kitty for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 would think that when we recall that the Prime Minister conducted the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign with duplicity, taking into account this arbitration coupled with his electoral speeches, we should highlight the Senate’s performance of a most useful role to ensure not only that unionists in the Public Service receive the benefit of the extra week’s annual leave but also that those public servants who, for their own reasons refuse to join a union, should also receive it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet not only do we have this major change in the law and the implementation of this major promise of the Prime Minister made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign carried out by regulation but also we have had many other examples of this kind of thing since 2nd December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out before, the Opposition parties do not deny the right of the Labor Government to implement its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that all Commonwealth employees would be granted 4 weeks annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main argument in this debate is that whatever happens to be Labor’s policy,  Senator Bishop  will say that one must read the Prime Minister’s pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech as embracing the whole of the Labor Party’s policy and that whatever is granted by this Government must be read in relation to every facet of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 26 of his policy speech before the <span class="highlight">election</span>  Mr Whitlam  stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730306_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government received new approaches from the South Australian Labor Government since the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December last requesting that urgent action be taken to improve the quality of River Murray water, particularly of that part of the Murray which flows through South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I will comment that the appointments to the Corporation by the previous administration immediately prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> were, I believe, a most indiscreet act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was quite obvious that the proper course would have been to await the outcome of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why was  Mr Mick  Young, Federal Secretary and campaign organiser for the Australian Labor Party, permitted to use VIP transport, for travel on the electoral duties of his Party during the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite the economics of the question, a determination was made prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year to use timber sleepers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the urgency to report upon an acquisition scheme, as indicated in Australian Labor Party amendments which were moved to the previous Government’s wool Bills, is his present attitude inconsistent with Labor priorities before the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the action taken by the previous Government in appointing such an important body should not have been taken on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He lost his seat to  Mrs Maurice  Blackburn and won the seat back at the following <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan’s  Party does not have to worry about the Democratic Labor Party because the DLP is not fielding candidates in the <span class="highlight">election</span> - so that is one obstacle out of the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All sorts of half-baked statements have come forward, but no definitive statement has been made, if the Government intends to introduce a Bill, as is reported, to give 4 weeks annual leave to all public servants in accordance with  Mr Whitlam’s  <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, then there can be no further argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can also understand the disappointment of the Opposition at not thinking of including a promise to grant 4 weeks annual leave to Commonwealth public servants in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said in this chamber that the decision to grant 4 weeks annual leave did not come about by negotiation but that it was a handout by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his policy speech before the <span class="highlight">election</span> promised that he would give 4 weeks annual leave to every public servant instead of the present 3 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remarkable situation which has been arrived at is that the Opposition is trying to get the Government to carry out the promise made by its leader in order to win the <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Australian Labor Party Government is fiercely resisting the efforts of the Opposition to carry out the Prime Minister’s promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, on 6th December, that  Mr Clyde  Cameron, who is now the Minister for Labour, confirmed that 4 weeks annual leave would be granted to public servants but added that it would apply only to those public servants who were members of given organisations or unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is surprising that now, after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, we see the Opposition and the Australian Democratic Labor Party supporting the concept of 4 weeks annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> not one of the political parties opposite mentioned that it would support or introduce any proposal to increase annual leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that Government’ supporters who have spoken in opposition to the motion moved by  Senator Greenwood  have proved conclusively that the policy of the Government was very clearly spelt out prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental issue which concerned the Opposition in relation to this matter was that an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise had been stated in general and unqualified terms that all public servants were to have 4 weeks annual leave but when the Government decided to implement that promise it retreated and said that the additional leave would be available only to those who were members of unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government today, belatedly, gave an assurance that it would honour the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise it gave, and it retreated from the position it adopted within a fortnight after it took office that it would limit this benefit to some unionists and not grant it to others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was that it was not prepared to sit by idly and do nothing when there had been a blatant repudiation by the Labor Party Government of one of its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Special Minister of State, who represents the Treasurer in this chamber, to the premature announcement by the Premier of South Australia during the course of his current State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that a $300m petro-chemical industry will be established by an American owned company at Redcliffs in the north of the Spencer Gulf area of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware of the details of what is going on in the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government feels that the fact that its Ministers met quite quickly after the <span class="highlight">election</span> and its quick action in proposing certain aid to the States have resulted in improvements which have been reflected in the employment figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is appropriate that I should draw the attention of honourable senators to what has been happening during the recess and since the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave -  Mr President,  the Senate notice paper contains a notice of motion for the disallowance of the Honey Industry (<span class="highlight">Election</span> of Board) Regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave -  Mr President,  the Honey Industry (<span class="highlight">Election</span> of Board) Regulations were introduced during the previous administration as Statutory Rules 1972, No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These regulations contain provisions relating to the entitlement of honey producers to enrolment as electors in elections for the Honey Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence of doubts which arose concerning enrolment as an elector and therefore eligibility to vote at an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the possibility that this would depend upon the discretion of returning officers, I gave notice on 12th October 1972 for disallowance of these regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting that in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the then Prime Minister made no specific proposal to increase pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 pointed out that I was not fired by any party political persuasion on the eve of a State <span class="highlight">election</span> but was merely quoting the valued opinion of high Treasury officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Three years ago, as a result of agitation by Country Party people throughout Queensland regarding the inequality in freight rates and to pacify them on the eve of the <span class="highlight">election</span> held 3 years before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Premier of Queensland brought in a firm of management consultants named Beckingsale Management Services Pty Ltd. That firm was commissioned to make an inquiry into freight rates operating in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it mean that the ALP believes it is in power because of the program it put forward in its policy speech at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, or is its mandate based on the ALP Conference proposals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adverting to the interjection which was just made, I am well aware that our colleague,  Senator Bonner,  in whose <span class="highlight">election</span> in his own right we all rejoice, received an overwhelming mandate from his Queensland electors to come into the Senate and oppose all that was contained in the Government’s policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the last <span class="highlight">election</span> with all its alleged defects gave the Government 54 per cent of the seats, although it obtained only 49.6 per cent of the primary vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that over the vast majority of elections since 1949, more people have preferred to vote for the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party and the Australian Democratic Labor Party than for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently there was some undertaking given to the Federal Conference of the Labor Party and once again the Labor Government sees its responsibility to its union base and Labor Party supporters - not to all the public servants and others in the work force who may have helped in their <span class="highlight">election</span>, but only to unionists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor was not elected to power to single out for privileged treatment the members of the unions which support it and traditionally contribute to <span class="highlight">election</span> funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in defiance of its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy, it attempted to introduce compulsory unionism for Commonwealth public servants; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 6 months prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> many of us said quite definitely that under our federal system, to which I do not object, there was a parallel between the imminent era of  Mr Whitlam,  in his anticipated role of Prime Minister, and that of the great American  President  Franklin D. Roosevelt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having gone around many electorates at large before and since the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, I am more than ever convinced that the people are clamouring for a better deal on national health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when we come back for the first session next year it will be found that most of our <span class="highlight">election</span> promises have been carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposals which the Prime Minister outlined in his address prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> are complimentary to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not really an argument on political philosophies but it was the highlight of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and something which had not come to Australia before - a fully mounted costly publicity campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like to see Australian elections following the pattern which we see- in America and which is something I abhor, but I foresee that we will become involved in this type of campaign in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that the La’bor Party approached the <span class="highlight">election</span> in that way, but having taken the lead in this matter over all other parties, it has gained success. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that honourable senators opposite will bear in mind that at future elections they will be posed with this same situation, so that in attempting to regain government in the future monetary contributions probably will be the most important factor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main aims that Labor has pronounced, not only in the Prime ‘Minister’s pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> speeches hut also in the Governor-General’s Speech, are complimentary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As was pointed out to the Senate by the Leader of the Opposition, under the electoral system the Labor Party can come to office without the first preference support of 50 per cent of the Australian people and yet acquire 54 per cent of the seats at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the Queen’s Opposition, which claims that it was defeated unfairly in the <span class="highlight">election</span> and which is competing with us for the management of this country on the basis that it is better able to run this country than the Labor Party is, debating a very important national issue, namely, United States bases in Australia; and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate says: 1 must admit that  Dr Forbes,  in leading for the Opposition in the other place, had the intention of flushing out the differences between the left and right wings of the Labor Party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>  Mr Barnard  made the Australian Labor Party’s position very clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He won a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland by an overwhelming and record majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  ;i  matter of fact, in the time since the new Parliament met the Opposition has been quoting the policy speech which  Mr Whitlam  presented before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and which was the blueprint of victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If no increase is to be granted, it may be that many people voted at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> upon the basis of misunderstanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The full benefits flowing from the former Government’s 1972 Budget and its sound economic planning have showed up completely the falsity of the assertions which were made at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that there would be 200,000 unemployed in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were going to have disastrous unemployment, according to those who put forward the Labor Party’s case before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also provides that the increases will be retrospective to the first full pay period after 2nd December last - again keeping an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When they were in office we used to hear, on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, reference to a 50c a week rise in pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its policy was to increase pensions by a max imum of 50c a week and such increases were always dangled as a political carrot before electors on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in an endeavour to win votes for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must stand condemned in the eyes of the people of Australia as members of a political party that has completely repudiated its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises of 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill also honours another <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Labor Party in that the class B and class C widow pensions will be brought into line with the pension payable to class A widows, namely, $21.50. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I conclude let me refer to an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that was made by the then Prime Minister,  Mr McMahon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed that the present Prime Minister - the Leader of the Australian Labor Party - dishonoured an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tt is the result of the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and embodies some new philosophies in the field of social services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The rate has been plucked out of the air by a political party in the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in which promises were made to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This excellent Bill fulfils an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise but the Government has shown some restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Minister may have admitted that his Government might have to review the question of the rate at which the pension shall be increased to achieve the target of 25 per cent of the average of the weekly male earnings, I think I must point out again that one of the important planks which the Labor Party put down in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was its desire to have a pension rate which, to quote the Prime Minister again, ‘will no longer be tied to financial and political considerations of annual Budgets’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is so, can the Minister state the reasons why the Government rushed in to give premature recognition to North Vietnam before the ink on the ceasefire agreement was really dry and the fighting had stopped, particularly in Cambodia, when straight after the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> it virtually exported or deported the Taiwanese officials from this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that  Mr Phillip  Adams was one of the publicity officers of the Australian Labor Party who directed its publicity campaign for the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if this money was made available before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, can the Minister explain the break with tradition that any producer must, in normal circumstances, put up portion of the front money so that the entire cost of his production is not financed by the Australian taxpayer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, is it a fact that the taxpayers’ money was being used to support this biased assistance even before the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might also point out to the honourable senator that I know that  Mr Phillip  Adams was approached by the former Prime Minister to work for him during the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government it was discussed, among other matters connected with immigration, and the Labor Government decided to adopt it as its policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, when I made a statement that the new Government would seek to alter the voting system, the Prime Minister gave his personal word that the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> would be contested according to the preferential voting system as at present used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that last night the Prime Minister said that it could be contested on a new system - optional preferential - I ask: Does this mean that the Prime Minister has repudiated one more <span class="highlight">election</span> promise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My understanding is that the issue which arose shortly prior to the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> was whether, if the Australian Labor Party were elected to govern^ ment, it would introduce legislation for first past the post voting in place of the preferential system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of South Australia said during his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech that he would make land available at Port Noarlunga for an ACTU scheme to build homes for workers at a cost, it now eventuates, of $10,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The increase of $1.50 in the base pension rate which was alluded to by the honourable the Prime Minister in his recent Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech, to be introduced in each autumn and spring session of Parliament until the base rate amounted to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, was granted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to bring forward legislation to lower the franchise age and the age of candidature to 18 years for Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At present, the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides that persons who are not under the age of 21 years are entitled to have their names placed on the roll and, when enrolled, to vote at elections for senators and for members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, under a special provision, a member of the defence force serving in a war zone outside Australia, who is under 21 years of age, is entitled to vote at a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In South Australia the 18-year-old franchise has been operative for State elections since June last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators may be aware, the age qualification for candidature at Federal elections has been coincidental with the minimum age for enrolment and voting since federation and the Government takes the view that there is no logical reason to depart from the uniform age practice under Commonwealth electoral law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that, in conjunction with the extension of the right to vote at 18 years of age, young people of this age should also have the right to nominate for <span class="highlight">election</span>, if they so choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They already enjoy this privilege for South Australian House of Assembly elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lowering of the age for candidature for Northern Territory Legislative Council elections to 18 years is a natural consequence of the adoption of that age for candidature for <span class="highlight">election</span> as a member of this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lowering of the age for enrolment and voting for both House of Representatives and Legislative Council elections in the Northern Territory will be achieved by amendments of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the decision result in the resignation from the new body of 2 eminent Australian artists and protests from Australians eminent in the field of art, who claimed that the Government had ignored its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730314_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, of course, that a balanced doctrine - for want of a better term I adopt the term used by the honourable senator - is embodied in the Broadcasting and Television Act insofar as it relates to political advertising during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The electoral officer in Victoria has contacted the Chief Electoral Officer in Canberra and has pointed out that an <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held in Victoria shortly and that he has fixed 21st March as the date for compilation of the Victorian roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that they do have an interest in politics and in what happens in this country, and that they will cast their votes according to their judgment of the political parties and the candidates at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I commend the Government for introducing the measure, which will give the 18-year-olds of Australia the right to vote in federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I vividly recall that on each of the last 9 sitting days of the Senate prior to the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and present Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Murphy,  moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable him to bring forward a Bill to give 18-year- olds the right to vote at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government parties of the day, supported by the Australian Democratic Labor Party, saw fit to deny 18-year-olds the right to vote at the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Little  would know that enrolment for State elections in South Australia is still voluntary, even if one is over the age of 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enrolment is not compulsory for State elections, but it is compulsory in Commonwealth elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The reason for this was very easy to see in the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Lower House on Saturday last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  was able to say that the actions that he and the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Barnard)  took were purely in line with the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and, as has been emphasised on many occasions, that the Labor Government had a mandate to take just those actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other important aspect for Australia following the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this new Labor Government is the likely effect on our domestic financial policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-65">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and  Mr Barnard,  whilst saying that they will adhere to a promise given prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the Australian troops would be withdrawn, are interpreting that as suggesting that it is still legitimate for them, within the terms of their promise, to leave a number of troops, variously stated to be perhaps 600 or 700, in Singapore after the departure of the battalion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730315_senate_28_s55/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No such proposal was included in the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-94-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Life  President, Dr Banda,  in declaring Conference open dealt rather extensively with the parliamentary system of government in Malawi and the village type of <span class="highlight">election</span> which had been adapted to the Westminster concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those rules, made in great haste in the early weeks after an <span class="highlight">election</span>, were brought in, I think, to operate from 1st February. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December 1971,  Mr Justice  Kerr proposed that the salary should be $13,000 and that there should be a further review soon after the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730328_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a matter which my Department has been watching and which was being watched prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wonder whether that is not a pious hope that is designed to accommodate present abilities to earlier <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and whether, by the end of this year, a situation will not have arisen in the Australian Capital Territory whereby any effective selfgovernment will be limited to areas so few in number that the persons who have been concerned to promote the cause of selfgovernment may feel that there is not very much merit in what would then be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, when we offered ourselves for <span class="highlight">election</span> or re-<span class="highlight">election</span> each of us knew the conditions of service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any increases should apply only after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Townley  accepted the payment which was prescribed by law when he stood for <span class="highlight">election</span>, surely he was enough of a man of the world to know that it could be altered at some time, as it has been altered from time to time since federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to follow  Senator Townley’s  suggestion and wait until 1975, the year of the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, this would mean that these increases not only would not be fixed today but that there would be n gap between 1968 and 1975 before salaries were again examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be one of the experiences in which we rejoice that there has been introduced into this place a system of <span class="highlight">election</span> that has given to this place in the representation of the people a variety of political opinion that is not capable of being expressed elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730329_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party asked people to support it at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, which they did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Were 18 merino rams shipped from Australia to Bombay after the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>, with the full authority of the Labor Government, to the order of the leading Indian textile combine, the J.K. organisation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730403_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say this to the Opposition: Notwithstanding the events which have occurred, the plain fact of the matter is that the discrimination in the Crimes Act and the previous Government’s failure to provide portability of pensions were 2 of the reasons why the Labor Party obtained the major ethnic vote of the major groups at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue before us for discussion is that on 2nd December last, within a fortnight after the general <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Senator Murphy  inherited a position of trust in the office of Attorney-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 18th October 1972 - and this was not so close to the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the former AttorneyGeneral could not act on it - the Assistant Director of the Special Reports Branch of the Department of Immigration made certain statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730404_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my policy speech at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> I said - and I say it again - that the greatest problem which this Government or any other government could have at present is racing inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>increased at a faster rate than that since the December <span class="highlight">election</span> and I feel that what the people want from this Government is positive action to correct this racing inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat what I said in my policy speech during the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign: The greatest problem that the incoming government faces in the control of the affairs of Australia is to correct inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as 1 am aware - I may well be wrong - the only time that this matter has been subjected to a vote of the people was during the Presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> in the United States last year when the people of California voted in a referendum on the subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to what occurred in the State of California in the United States of America during the last presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> when there was a poll in that State to determine whether or not the death penalty should be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator should be aware that in accordance with its undertaking to the Australian people at the general <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government has taken up directly with the French Government the question of the legality of French atmospheric tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-72-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government: Is it not traditional in the Australian Parliament that, following a general <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives, there is a debate entitled the AddressinReply debate which gives all honourable senators the opportunity to address the Senate on any subject desired? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very happy to be able to stand in this chamber tonight and say that the abolition of the wine excise was one of the policies enunciated by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  during his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that immediately on <span class="highlight">election</span> to government the Australian Labor Party would abolish this tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party has been accused of using the abolition of the wine tax as a political issue during recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pledge that the Australian Labor Party when elected to office - which will be at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> - led by  Mr Whitlam  will repeal the excise on the wine industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign they said from the hustings we were putting up this proposition only as political bait. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it took the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government to put in a position where they could vote against the wine excise these members of the Liberal Party who tell the electors they are men of free choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> show that  Mr Giles  has got himself into a bit of a political knot and is writing statements to the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, for the first time in the history of the division of Angas,  Mr Giles  had to go to preferences to retain his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Party decides for some reason or other not to run a candidate,  Mr Giles  is gone because the Country Party is an emerging force in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party won the seat of Flinders at the State <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10th March last and went very close to winning Rocky River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Young  will have problems for he is number 2 on the ticket for the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and faces the advent of  Mr Hall  running as an LM candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the good vote he got his Party ran candidates in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> and won seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I should like to endorse what  Senator McLaren  has said about Reg Curran, the member for Chaffey who was defeated in a recent State <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promise at <span class="highlight">election</span> time was that the Labor Party would grant it to all public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Great liberty was given to  Senator McLaren  when he referred to what had been said by various South Australian senators about the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also said in the course of that debate that if the Government were to introduce a Bill providing for 4 weeks annual leave for public servants in accordance with its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, which was to do so without qualification or strings of any kind, the Liberal Party section of the Opposition in this chamber would not oppose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight, that Bill having been presented in this chamber we, unlike the Government which did not abide by its <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking in this regard, are abiding by the undertaking we gave to the Senate in that debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless we recognise that this policy was clearly enunciated in the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises of the Australian Labor Party and obviously it gained a clear mandate for that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has not already done so will the Minister give consideration to taking early legislative action to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to the ban on the broadcasting of political matter within 48 hours of an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure he will agree that in the past ithas been found impossible to put this ban into practice, particularly in relation to State elections and especially if they are held when the Australian Parliament is in session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AsI understand the position to date, the general interpretation of the existing section has been to exclude news broadcasts relating to political speeches and events within the 3-day period from midnight on the Wednesday preceding the rate of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say in further replying to the honourable senator that if the situation is to be eased it will be necessary for solid assurances to be given by the licensees so that if a particular station chooses to indulge in partisan and biased reporting on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> the parties discriminated against can be confident that they will have an opportunity to reply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the campaign preceding the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the new Government, at each place the Minister visited he made on the spot checks of the mounting problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This seems strange when we look at the figures for the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This record shows that the first action occurred on 7th December which was pretty quick since the <span class="highlight">election</span> was held on 2nd December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But there is to be a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> either towards the end of this year or early next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It could well be that the Government will have the numbers in the Senate after the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign there was a surprising and perhaps historic agreement among all parties represented in this Parliament that decentralisation had become a pressing national issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is in a position to give full expression to all those promises made during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign about spending capital in country areas to make them attractive for Australians to live in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have noticed that newspapers such as the ‘Australian’, which are no friends of us or anybody on this side of the Senate and which, in the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, by their support assisted in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the present Government, have said definitely that there ought to be a judicial inquiry to determine the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730412_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As to the suggestions about Australian Labor Party policies, I point out that already the new Government has done a great deal to carry out the policies that were announced during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the great achievements of the Labor Government upon its <span class="highlight">election</span> was immediately to abolish conscription and withdraw all forces from South Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730502_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Education that the establishment of a fourth university in Victoria has been contemplated for a number of years and that at the time of the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1970 both major political parties - that is, the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia - announced their intention to establish a fourth university, if elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a paramount reason for rejecting the proposal put by him now, and all the other proposals, because in the policy speech of the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  made before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> and since circulated, these words were used- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whatever might be said by the honourable senator opposite - he is entitled to put his view - I am entitled to put the view that this is a measure introduced by the Government in pursuance of an undertaking made to the people in most specific terms before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, I point out to the Senate that included in the Australian Labor Party policy speech were these words: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we are entitled to say that whatever might be the views and the judgments of persons on the measure - it is clear that a number do have judgments which accord with ours - rat the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives where the people’s views were sought the people returned this Government with a mandate to introduce precisely the same measure which was passed by the Senate in March 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true, of course, that the AttorneyGeneral has supervision of the law, but I worry greatly when a politician has to make a decision in  ne  atmosphere and pressures of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, wilh the media beating up a melodramatic and emotional campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I noted during the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Prime Minister indicated that when a Labor government was elected it would be Government policy to implement the general principles embodied in the recommendations contained in the report dealing with the problems of mentally and physically handicapped persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister: Does this reflect the Government’s complete disregard for the rural sector, which was evident in the policy speech delivered before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and the decisions that have been made since the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 2nd’ December? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is becoming quite obvious that the sooner a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> is forced for both Houses of Parliament by the Government the better it will be for everyone because the Government’s legislative program in the Senate has been delayed for far too long by the combined Opposition engaging on a weekly basis and, when Senate is on the air, on a daily basis in a witch hunt of the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have had today is a continuation of what was started when this Parliament first sat after the <span class="highlight">election</span> - a combination of minority parties which do not have the support of the people of Australia wanting to decide what the Senate shall do and wanting to take out of the hands of the Government in the Senate its power to introduce the legislation which it has been authorised by mandate of the Australian people to introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> there has been a change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, the fact of the matter is that the ALP is like any other political party in that if it can fix things to stay in office it will do so.The DLP made clear to the public during the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign what would happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The decision is that optional preferential voting will be introduced at the first available moment’.I was foolish enough, wise enough or rash enough to mention this before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact was that before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, although  Mr Whitlam  kept it dark and everybody was sworn to secrecy, I was not sworn to secrecy and was told by people in the know that the Committee had decided to recommend optional preferential voting because it was nearly as good as first past the post but did not sound so bad to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately the Democratic Labor Party knew beforethe <span class="highlight">election</span> that it was all fixed and that at the first available moment the new Government would bring in optional preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other day I was reading a statement by a South Australian, politician - this will appeal to the Minister for Works  (Senator Cavanagh)  in which he pointed out that in the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> in that State the Labor Party received SI per cent of the votes and won 57 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that the Swedish Social Democrats could not have held Government continually for 40 years without a break, but for the fact that they had a fair and honest system of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And there is great temptation  for  a party in office to have dishonest systems of elections - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only the quota-preferential method comes anywhere near satisfying the criterion of justice to all electors,  whereunder  their right can be realised to cast a useful vote that takes part in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the Labor Party holds the 2 largest seats in the Commonwealth and its members do not complain that the work is too heavy, because they are able to do it, they are willing to do it and they do it, and they are re-elected <span class="highlight">election</span> after <span class="highlight">election</span> to these 2 largest seats in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation was reached with respect to Kara Kara that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, despite the completely gerrymandered nature of the electorate, the handful of voters - fewer than  18,000 -  elected the Labor Party candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This fact was demonstrated in the voting figures at the last Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a result of that redistribution, the Labor Party lost the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party and other people prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> were talking about taking legal action to compel the then Government to arrange for a redistribution in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> a Western Australian vote was worth less than a vote in any other State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is clear that the closer you get to this ideal of equal representation and equal numbers, the closer you are to getting a change that would sweep one party or the other completely out of the Parliament at an <span class="highlight">election</span> in which a swing occurred one way or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As everyone is aware, a casual vacancy in the Senate is filled by the Houses of the Parliament of the State in question sitting and voting together to choose a person to hold that place until the expiration of the term or until the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor, whichever first happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the period between  19’68,  when the redistribution occurred, and the next <span class="highlight">election</span> the population of a number of seats had grown so fast that they were already out of kilter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I say, if we were to remove the electorate of Darling from New South Wales and leave in the electorate of Eden-Monaro - it would take 2 days to drive around its 122 polling places - one country vote at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> was equal to 1.04 extra metropolitan votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the State Labor Government, which was defeated in 1965, had been responsible for a bodgie redistribution, which has been suggested by some Opposition speakers,’ - it seems that the State Government made a pretty bad fix because it was defeated- at the 1965 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the  1959  State <span class="highlight">election</span> - one could go back to each <span class="highlight">election</span> prior to that and find somewhat the same result - the ruling Liberal Country League received  37  per cent of the vote as against the Labor Party’s  49.5  per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was taken purely and simply to enhance the fading electoral prospects of the Liberal-Country Party in the <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held in New South Wales next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that now that the Australian Democratic Labor Party faces the prospect of having its number of representatives reduced from  5  to  2  in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, it is putting pressure on the Victorian Liberal Party and possibly on the Victorian Country Party to change the voting system in that State in order to provide for proportional representation, or whatever other name  Senator McManus  calls this new voting procedure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the number of these new electors in each electorate, the enrolments are pretty slow and this could upset the redistribution to some extent and a sudden spate of applications for enrolment just before the <span class="highlight">election</span> could change the quotas very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The example set by  Senator Gair,  who is now Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, was promptly followed by the Country Party in Queensland led by  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  whose efforts at gerrymandering have exceeded the efforts of  Senator Gair,  as was shown by the <span class="highlight">election</span> results outlined by  Senator Ron  McAuliffe last night, that is, that the Party with the minority of support is in power because of the electoral system operating in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As Lloyd George used to say, at every <span class="highlight">election</span> his Party used to be tripped by the triangle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this place last year I heard the story about a union <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last <span class="highlight">election</span> we received the overwhelming number of votes and for the first time, thank goodness, despite the gerrymander of the honourable senator’s Party in 1965, the electoral weight of the people was so much against the then Government that they threw it out of office and now we are trying to bring parliamentary democracy back into the Australian electorate by reducing the 20 per cent disparity to what was normal custom, practice and tradition until 1965. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> my Party warned that a Whitlam Government- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have his word for it that a full scale review is proposed and that he hopes the amendments will be passed into law before the next <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister said, when finally smoked out by the advertising campaign of the Democratic Labor Party, that he did not intend to alter the Act to a first past the post voting system until after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I saw his performance in a Party <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the party to which I once belonged there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were  2  sets of candidates offering for <span class="highlight">election</span> - the group to which I belonged and the group to which  Senator Mulvihill  belonged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do want to say that the Prime Minister, having promised on the <span class="highlight">election</span> eve not to introduce first past the post voting until after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, did talk about a system of optional preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He completely disregarded the promise he made on the eve of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, which shows just how dubious the Prime Minister’s promises are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> results since 1958 show that the Labor Party failed to win office whenever the people wanted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not disguise the fact that this Government has never won the support of the majority of the Australian electors, that it has never won 50 per cent plus one of the votes in any <span class="highlight">election</span> held from 1958 up to and including 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Party falsely claiming to be the Party of the workers depends for <span class="highlight">election</span> on the whims of a millionaire and his hobby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the ALP now governs with a minority - it has done so since the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> - is an example of this, and it certainly is an argument in support of and not against the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The threat in Western Australia was that there could be a challenge to the validity of the <span class="highlight">election</span> held in December 1972 because the Government had failed to carry out its responsibilities in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The obvious reason for a tolerance is to ensure that it is not necessary to have an electoral redistribution after every <span class="highlight">election</span> or maybe twice within the life of a Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation could arise in any <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country in which, say, 2 parties were vying for votes and where one party got 51 per cent of the votes in every electorate and the other party got 49 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As everyone knows in the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> the present Government got the numbers and also the number of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the <span class="highlight">election</span>  of  a Labor government next year immediate steps will be taken to redraft the Electoral Act to meet the changing needs of our time . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the importance of this Bill is such that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and his Government have said that if this Bill is rejected a situation will be created in which the Government will be pleased to take the issue to the people of Australia and to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives and the Senate which will be dissolved at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government certainly will not take the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that in the very near future the Government may hold a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result of that <span class="highlight">election</span> will be quite interesting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made it clear he would regard Saturday’s Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span> as a judgment on whether the Senate Opposition’s actions had the backing of the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I predict to the Labor Party that the antisocialists in Victoria will have a very handsome win in that coming State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister states that he will take the judgment of the people of Victoria on the Federal Government by their vote in that State <span class="highlight">election</span>, I will be very pleased to learn of their reaction next Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I certainly withdraw the remark if  Senator McLaren  assures me that he has made no purchase in Canberra since his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the moment nobody in the Government can tell me that the vote of a person who has the necessary finance to put money into the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign fund of a party has the same strength as the vote of a poor citizen who has not the necessary finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall one prominent businessman being proud of the fact that he poured $50,000 into the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us have a look at the situation in the outer areas of Melbourne, which is where the Australian Labor Party won the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When people in their wisdom at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> constituted this chamber they gave an Opposition numerically exceeding Government members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possibly the High Court would then order - there is precedent for this - the appointment of an additional representative by means of an <span class="highlight">election</span> involving the whole State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it was introduced on its own so that 18-year-olds would have the right to vote should an emergency by-<span class="highlight">election</span> be held at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot compare a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> with an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only electorates in the 1948 <span class="highlight">election</span> which had a number of electors  either in excess of 10 per cent of the quota or below 10 per cent of the quota were one in New South Wales, 3 in Victoria, 5 in Queensland and 6 in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that we cannot allow another <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held while such a situation obtains. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal to increase House of Representative’s representation in the Australian Capital Territory to 2 members will be authorised on the basis of section 122 of the Constitution as will the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 Senators for the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A definite assurance has been given by the Prime Minister to the effect that the system of voting to elect the House of Representatives will not be altered to the first past the post method before the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and in answer to a question on 15th March he gave that assurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A voter is given the option to decide for how many candidates seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> for a division he will cast a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an example, 14 candidates may seek <span class="highlight">election</span> for a division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in defiance of its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy, it attempted to introduce compulsory unionism for Commonwealth public servants; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fair to presume that the Prime Minister is trying to create an atmosphere of his being frustrated by this chamber, so much so that in Melbourne in connection with the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign he has used some very despicable words to describe honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Whitlam  spoke about open government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of that was that while the political complexion of the other House might change completely this chamber would have a carry-over from the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators so there would not be a sudden change and there would be a continuity of thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, is this not a departure from <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to make funds available at low interest rates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We follow the principles laid down in the platform and resolutions of the Australian Labor Party, and we follow the promise, made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> speech, for early passage of this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with that platform, the Federal Leader of the Party,  Mr Whitlam,  put this policy forward quite clearly and explicitly at the campaign for the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> which took place on 2 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While  Senator Wheeldon  pointed to the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  delivered before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> as granting him a mandate from the Australian people, it must also be said that there are major sections within the Australian Labor Party and the leaders of the State Parties in a number of States who really do not accept that as a decision of the people, and apparently they do not accept it as the policy of the Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the fact is - 1 have said it previously and I reiterate it tonight - that there was constant agitation as part of <span class="highlight">election</span> issues for the removal of these discriminatory clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether that tune was changed by the results of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> I do not know, but to me it seems ridiculous to believe that a Minister can give conscious decision on a Bill and then readily agree to 18 amendments lock, stock and barrel which were moved by the Opposition in order to confine the advancement of government enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was some government mediation to a very minor degree before the <span class="highlight">election</span>; and what  Mr Connor  has done since has put this in bold relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I permit myself the comment that the Labor Party before the <span class="highlight">election</span> set out so strongly and forcefully to have everything planned and knew what it was going to do, but this Pipeline Authority Bill, because of the way in which it has been developed, makes a mockery of all those assertions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the then Opposition gave no such undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  mentioned the matter on a number of occasions during the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and it is reasonable to assume that the Australian Labor Party has a mandate to bring in a Bill called the Prices Justification Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The former Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  when asked in a television interview before the <span class="highlight">election</span> what would happen to strikes in Australia, what would happen to industrial unrest, admitted that they had caused the increase in inflation in the last two or three years and said: ‘They will not occur under Labor because we know how to get along with each other’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> was held on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Bill, which I introduced on 1 May, gave effect to another of our <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and provided for the continuation of age, invalid and widows pensions to Australian pensioners proceeding overseas, irrespective of their destination and without any of the restrictions which had been imposed by the previous Government and which had limited the operation of their reciprocal pension portability scheme to 4 countries only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The legislation implements a firm undertaking which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  gave on behalf of the Austrian Labor Party at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr N.  H. Bowen also said in relation to the Bill that ‘this issue was put very fully from time to time before the Australian people, and at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> they voted the present Labor Government into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A large manufacturing company, Marrickville Margarine Pty Ltd, is known to be a financier of the Labor Party’s mid-term <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730529_senate_28_s56/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only regret that the Government, notwithstanding the flush of its <span class="highlight">election</span> victory and knowing what its platform and policy stated, should have directed the work of the Committee in that way because 1 feel that we undoubtedly would have gained more from the natural evolution of this Committee’s work along the lines of the original terms of reference which had been sent to it if it had been able to come forward with what it felt was the most appropriate remedy in the circumstances as it found them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that what has played a big role in making up the minds of  Senator Withers,  the mover of this motion, and those who are supporting it is a euphoric misreading of the results of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that in the light of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> results honourable senators on the Opposition side were carried away and felt that they could draw some comfort from the results and, in fact, that they should try to goad us on this side into a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not in any way put out by the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have given one of the reasons, namely, that it got carried away and misread the results of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, because it has the numbers here, because some of its members are infantile enough to read into the adventitious result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in one State a notion that  Mr Snedden,  as he put it himself, will soon be Prime Minister, they think that they should twist our tail and provoke us if they can. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would ask the honourable gentleman opposite who got carried away with the result of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> to ponder this one: When it does come to a double dissolution and when it comes to a conflict on the hustings, do honourable senators opposite know who the combatants will be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Webster  who will not be with us much longer anyway, can draw any comfort from that interjection, I suggest to him that he give some serious thought to the contestants in the next <span class="highlight">election</span> which will not be very far off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We notice that even the idea of having an ombudsman, which we put up 18 years ago during our first <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, ultimately has been adopted by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt whether a more responsible member of his Party would make such threats, but he made them and he drew attention to the line-up of candidates in the <span class="highlight">election</span> that would result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those Premiers are lined up behind  Mr Snedden,  whose Party stated where it stood on this issue, both before and after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, but then we have coming in to add weight to the team the Premier of Western Australia,  Mr Tonkin,  the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  and the Premier of Tasmania,  Mr Reece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear the argument that  Mr Whitlam  made a specific statement in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and, because he won the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> by half a length - it was not quite a photo finish, but it was getting pretty close to it - he has a complete mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore one can draw the conclusion that an amendment which seeks to defer debate on the Bill to a later stage is nothing more than a cheap political trick which is designed to overcome certain difficulties which exist among members of the Opposition Parties who are seeking preselection for the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are saying: ‘We will exercise what influence we can on the Party affiliations within the Senate by bringing pressure to bear on those who want to be renominated in order to contest the next <span class="highlight">election</span> for their Party’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gave an unusual interpretation of the result of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard it stated that the attitude of my Leader,  Senator Withers,  is promoted by political considerations arising out of the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> and political considerations involving the endorsement of some of my colleagues for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, circumstances have changed with respect to Townsville and the Government seems to have gone cold on its plans to develop that region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I  think  I  could sum up by saying that some of the bad points of the concept of the Bill are: That the land is to be made available on a leasehold basis; land prices are to be frozen, which does not occur in other parts of Australia; there is to be a certain amount of loss of freedom to do as one likes with one’s land; there is to be a certain amount of regimentation by some control body; and probably the people who live in the area will have no say in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of that body, and probably there will be no authority at a local level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to put on record the statement made by  Dr Eastick  when speaking at Murray Bridge in support of the Liberal Country League candidate prior to the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>, f have a copy of a cutting from the ‘Murray Valley Standard’ of 8 March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand,  Dr Eastick  endeavoured, perhaps for propaganda purposes during the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, to discredit the Labor Party by throwing a lot of cold water on the concept of Monarto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In our short time in office - I think mainly because it was an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise - we have made a commitment to develop the Albury-Wodonga area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government fought an <span class="highlight">election</span> over, and promised the development of, AlburyWodonga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When does the Government propose to take remedial action, promised prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, relating to the mentally and physically handicapped persons in Australia whose serious plight was illustrated by the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, which made 85 recommendations for assisting such people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Prime Minister regard the preparation of policy material used by the Victorian Labor Party in a State <span class="highlight">election</span> as a proper function for the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730530_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that during the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last November leaders of the Australian Labor Party promised Tasmanian electors that early steps would be taken to recreate the Inter-State Commission with the objective, inter aiia, of assisting to overcome Tasmania’s transport disabilities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious what is taking place in the Senate, and I do not intend to deal with a situation which I trust will be corrected at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> when the numbers in this place will be changed and no longer will the Government be able to be trampled by the weight of numbers of the Opposition which has succeeded in breaking down all the conventions and the proper operation of the Senate and the respect which the previous Opposition had for the operation of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister for Primary Industry recall a statement by the then shadow Minister for Primary Industry,  Dr Rex  Patterson, when outlining the Australian Labor Party’s rural policy prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the disadvantages caused to these industries by the revaluation of the Australian dollar in December, the realignment with the American dollar in February and the galloping inflation which is pushing up costs to these industries, what does the Government propose to do to honour this <span class="highlight">election</span> promise by the responsible Labor Party spokesman on rural matters during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated then, and I state again now, that the Government’s policy was laid out quite clearly in  Mr Whitlam’s  policy speech and also in the rural booklet which was published specifically for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Media will recall that before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the Prime Minister indicated that he would initiate an investigation into the viability and the practicability of the introduction of frequency modulation broadcasts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLANDTrue it is that during the course of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister said, amongst other things, that when a Labor Government was elected to office it would adhere to the timetable for the introduction of colour television as laid down by the previous Government and that it would endeavour to expedite the introduction of frequency modulation radio broadcasts in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Minister for Primary Industry: Is it a fact that the Minister for Immigration in an <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement last year stated that $500m provided to farmers at 3 per cent interest would cost the Government only $15m to subsidise the interest rate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was this consistent in principle with pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> statements made by some other Labor candidates in rural areas? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there had not been an <span class="highlight">election</span>, or even if we had not been returned as the Government, I am sure that what is now the Opposition would have realised that our work force policy would have had to be kept under review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Federal Government came too late to do anything about Lake Pedder even if it had been discovered that it was more desirous to keep the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has just been an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Victoria in which the people of that State made it very clear which party they would prefer to have in government in Victoria, a State in which one of the important aspects of the policy put by the Victorian Government to the people was homeownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the results of the last Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> indicate that the people vitally concerned in housing were prepared to support the policies of the Victorian Liberal Government and not the policies of the Labor Party in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator McLaren  looks at the figures instead of listening to his colleagues he will ascertain that not only did the Liberal Party win the <span class="highlight">election</span> in Victoria with an increase of  8  per cent in the vote, but there was also a drop in the Labor Party’s figures of between  5  per cent and  6  per cent on what it achieved last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To state that the Australian Labor Party polled more votes than the Liberal Party at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Victoria is completely untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> only because  Mr Johnson,  the Federal Minister for Housing, when a difference arose between the States and himself earlier this year, stated - I quote what appears in the Sun-Pictorial’ of Melbourne,  18  January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that in the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> these competing policies in regard to housing were raised for the Victorian electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never let it be thought that  Mr Whitlam  himself was not prepared before the <span class="highlight">election</span> to let the electorate of Victoria pass judgment on what he had been doing for 5 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it is no surprise that as  Mr Hamer  was able to indicate during the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, 80 per cent of Victorian houses are owned or are being purchased by those who live in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We, for our part, will fight any <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time and any place on the right of the Australian citizen who wants to buy his own home to be able to buy his own home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is a $200 deposit, and in our policy speech for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> we will drop it to $100. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On this issue, which was one of the <span class="highlight">election</span> issues in Victoria, the Labor Party suffered an enormous drop in its percentage, and the Liberal Party’s percentage has never been higher in some 25 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under an arrangement between the Governor-General and the Governors of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the Australian Electoral Office is responsible for maintaining joint electoral rolls and these rolls are used for both Federal and State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants up-to-date electoral rolls and maximum efficiency in the conduct of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also wants quicker production of <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is estimated that the electoral enrolment of the Australian Capital Territory will exceed 120,000 by December 1975 - the normal time for the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives and 185,000 by 1980 - an annual increase of about 9 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an additional member for the Australian Capital Territory was provided as from the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> on the basis of the Territory being divided into 2 divisions, the estimated average number of electors per division, about 60,000 would be in reasonable conformity with the average for the States combined, 58,741 as at 27 April 1973, and considerably in excess of that for Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arises from the differing legal opinions as to whether it would be constitutionally practicable to provide for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of an additional member for the Australian Capital Territory during the term of the current Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because a doubt does exist about the matter, the Government considers the wisest course is to defer the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the additional member until the next general elections for the House of Representatives, particularly as separate legislation is being introduced to provide for 2 senators for the Australian Capital Territory to be elected before that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of the senators will in the interim period provide the additional representation so urgently required in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their <span class="highlight">election</span> until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general <span class="highlight">election</span> for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first <span class="highlight">election</span> for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>; and for the Territory senators to be elected under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was recommended by the Committee that the Constitution should be amended to provide that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the senators every time there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee believed that this would cut down the number of elections and so minimize the distraction of elections and the difference between the two Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The decision to bring the elections of Territory senators into line with those of the House of Representatives is in accordance with the Constitutional Review Committee’s findings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Both senators will be elected every time there is a general <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So for the Territories there will be elections for both Houses of Parliament at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When this Bill passes the Parliament, the writs will be issued for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators for the Territories concurrent with the next Senate general <span class="highlight">election</span> or House of Representatives general <span class="highlight">election</span>, whichever is the sooner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, would this not mean that the proposed interest rates of 7 per cent to 8 per cent represent a substantial increase and negate various statements made by Labor spokesmen prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Airlines Agreement Bill was debated in the House of Representatives on 25 October 1972,  Mr Charles  Jones, the present Minister for Civil Aviation, as reported at page 3147 of Hansard, stated very clearly that he would restore the superannuation fund to what it was before if Labor won the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and this in fact is what has happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730601_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators may seek comfort from this: I think it was last Saturday week that there was a Legislative Council <span class="highlight">election</span> in Tasmania in respect of 3 divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that <span class="highlight">election</span> Labor fared badly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tell the honourable senator that if that same Labor Government had done some of the things in Tasmania which the Federal Government has done - for example, had it sponsored such a thing as the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement - it would not have survived the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As we approach a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of this year I think it is highly salutary that the people of Australia can see precisely what this chamber would be subjected to if the Labor Party were ever to have the numbers in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>public interest, an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Australian Labor Party to grant  4  weeks annual leave to all public servants would have been limited by the deliberate choice of the Government to union members only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stated on an <span class="highlight">election</span> platform, that has quite a superficial appeal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not see anything in the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  which mentioned actions for tort Having sighted it in the platform and the policy of the Australian Labor Party I have mentioned it all over Queensland but Australian Labor Party candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> have denied that the Government would ever introduce such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say here and now without any fear of hesitation that the committee will be nothing more than a device to remove the thorny problem of industrial relations from the scene until after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proof of that is to be found in a speech made by  Senator Gair  to the National Press Club in Canberra prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in which he produced the minutes of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, which showed quite clearly that it was not until  Mr Whitlam  gave a clear undertaking as to what the Bill would provide - the abolition of the penal provisions from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and so forth - that it agreed to hand over $25,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only after  Mr Carmichaels  union had extracted the promise from  Mr Whitlam  that the Australian Labor Party would abolish all the penal provisions from the present legislation if it were elected to office that it was prepared to, and in fact did, hand over $25,000 to the Labor Party for its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, which was so keen to contribute $25,000 to the Austraiian Labor Party <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, funds, ‘was one amalgamation which was brought about by stealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inquiry was intended for no other purpose than to give  Senator Wright  and possibly  Senator Rae  publicity in Tasmania solely because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is impending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is another example of an endeavour by the Opposition to overcome the will of the people as expressed at the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> the present Government stated that this Ordinance would be repealed if it were elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That gave effect to the promise that the Government made before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the Ordinance would be repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bills also provide that the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators shall be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> for members of the House of Representatives if it is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that earlier I made the point that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators is to take place at the same time as elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is an attempt to intrude non-State representatives into the Senate with terms of service the same as the terms of members of the House of Representatives, with elections to be held at the same time as general elections for the House of Representatives, and with any vacancies of such representatives being filled at an <span class="highlight">election</span> as though it were a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for a vacancy in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such a proposal would make destitute the system of proportional representation instituted by a former Labor Government for Senate elections, which system has provided in the Senate a true reflection of the political feeling in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know full well Prime Minister Whitlam’s burning desire to take half the Senate out at each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> - or is it his intention to take all the Senate to <span class="highlight">election</span> with the lower House and so completely destroy the Senate by making it a replica of the House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I do not agree with suggestions that the Government can claim a mandate for everything in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy, it made the repeal of the National Service Act such a prominent feature of its policy that it can claim to have a mandate in that regard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730607_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam,  as the Labor Leader prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our attitude since becoming the Government has been completely consistent with the attitude we adopted in respect of that legislation and the attitude that was adopted, announced and enunciated by the Labor leader at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> when he made his policy speech on behalf of the Labor movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the main points of issue so far as the Opposition is concerned is that during those months prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> education was of particular importance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister has reneged on a promise which he gave the Australian people and which was intended to gather in votes prior to a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we do not have to rely only on the words in the recording of  Mr Whitlam’s  speech on 2 May 1972 which, I remind the Senate, was a period approaching a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The case which the Opposition attempts to make against us today is that we have dishonoured an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise by discontinuing the current grants to the category A schools this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  said as an <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that the present Minister for Education OM, Beazley) was also electioneering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of his electioneering, the present Minister for Education said that his policy was that the Commonwealth should have identity with the education of every child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He toured a number of areas in the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and, in search of votes, he published a document called ‘Priorities in Education’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 2 of that document he made this pledge, this <span class="highlight">election</span> promise: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This increase was made not on the basis of a grant of 5m which  Senator Rae’s  Party made available when it was in Government and was looking for votes - when it bought votes with 5m in order to win an <span class="highlight">election</span> - but on the basis of a deeply considered and deeply studied analysis of the education system of this country by a very responsible committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are honouring their <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in the areas of education, social services and all these other matters’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As Sentaor McManus cogently reminded us, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign those who are now the Prime Minister and Ministers of this Government assured the public that it need fear no reduction in any per capita grants which were then available to pupils at non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the Government intend todo to allay the widespread dissatisfaction of persons interested in the Arts, who allege they have been doublecrossed on pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises of a new deal for the Arts, by the appointment of  Dr Coombs  to a dictatorship in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government action since the <span class="highlight">election</span> relating to administration of the arts corresponds exactly to the proposals outlined in my policy speech of November 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister recall that during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Australian Labor Party promised not to reduce defence spending below 3.5 per cent of the gross national product? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many further <span class="highlight">election</span> promises does the Government propose to break? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the first part of the question in which he talks about scaling down income tax, we have said continually - we said it before the <span class="highlight">election</span> - that 23 years of ineptitude of the previous Government could not be overcome in one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister for Repatriation, who is also the minister assisting the Minister for Defence, recall <span class="highlight">election</span> assurances that a Labor Government would provide greatly expanded work for Australian defence industries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the Labor Party’s policy when <span class="highlight">election</span> fever was on, and  Mr Davies,  the local member, was assiduous to get the service restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> and since the <span class="highlight">election</span> this Government promised to subsidise shipping services to King Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have honoured an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign obligation to subsidise shipping to King Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recognise the difference between the approach of the new Labor Government in keeping with its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise and the approach of the previous Government which let the island go 6 months without a vessel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the members who insisted on the Committee for propaganda purposes would join with the Government for the purpose of getting some satisfactory commercial transport to King Island I think they would be doing a better service to King Island than by seeking to protect their own hides for re-<span class="highlight">election</span> or for pre-selection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He suggested that every member of this chamber should vote for the proposition as it stood merely because - he quoted from the political arguments of his own Party during the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign - of what his Party had said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy had suggested to this chamber that virtually nobody had the right to suggest amendments or to propose any alteration to the Bill because the Government had obtained a mandate from the people by winning the <span class="highlight">election</span> and that the people of this country had given an instruction that the Bills should be passed in exactly the form that had been argued in the Senate and carried by the Senate on the previous occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was drawing attention to the fact that that did not mean that senators sitting in this chamber representing different States were not even bound to present the point of view that seemed to be paramount in the State which each represented, whatever may have been the result of the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, to substantiate my argument in that area, since this matter was adjourned an <span class="highlight">election</span> has been held in Victoria, the State which I represent here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the party that was in favour of the retention of the death penalty at that time - it may be in the process of changing its attitude now, but in the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign it had a clear policy which it had enunciated and fought for on the platform at that <span class="highlight">election</span> and at every State <span class="highlight">election</span> for the last 15 years - won that <span class="highlight">election</span> in Victoria by an overwhelming majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One feature of the performance of this Government since its <span class="highlight">election</span> has been that it has interested itself more than any other Australian Government in other people’s business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the <span class="highlight">election</span> he has been on the move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when the <span class="highlight">election</span> came they voted for the stolid, serious man who never laughed but who. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> one day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it came to the <span class="highlight">election</span> after he attained power, with all his posturing, all his fun, all his sneers and all his quips, they preferred the man whom they thought would do a serious job of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But more significant was the fact that a State <span class="highlight">election</span> was held on the issue whether South Australia would have the Chowilla Dam or the proposed and recommended Dartmouth Dam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in accordance with Labor Party policy as enunciated at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, when .the proposed national health scheme was one of the main planks on which the Government was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will immediate consideration be given to rectifying the position and honouring an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise which was given? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no breach of any <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that direct taxes would not be increased and that promise was carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the major planks of our <span class="highlight">election</span> platform, and the chief reason for the Labor Party winning the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, was our commitment to the improvement of the quality of life and standards of service in existing cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted also that there was only one occasion on which this did not apply, and that was in 1954 when the <span class="highlight">election</span> was fought on  boundaries  drawn up in 1948 under a Labor administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government is merely attempting to secure itself in office and that its arguments that electoral boundaries should be changed before the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span> are mere subterfuge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally under the Companies Act and elsewhere these provisions are aimed not to prevent the proper operation of a body because there may be some invalidity in the <span class="highlight">election</span> or appointment of a person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generally they provide in substance that the acts of a conference, board, commission or other body are valid notwithstanding that there might be some defect in the <span class="highlight">election</span> or appointment of a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here the provision is that the appointment or <span class="highlight">election</span> of a member is not invalid by reason only of a defect or irregularity in connection with that appointment or <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to an <span class="highlight">election</span> itself, the general principle is rather that the validity of the acts of the person and the body are protected and generally there is some provision for inquiry into the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me to protect a person’s appointment or <span class="highlight">election</span> even though there may be some defect or irregularity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it means that one could move to prevent the appointment or <span class="highlight">election</span> if there were some defect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once the appointment or <span class="highlight">election</span> had been made - unless I can find something else which qualifies this - it seems that the appointment or <span class="highlight">election</span> cannot be attacked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably there ought to be some kind of disputed elections mechanism, perhaps by the Superior Court or some other body which could deal with the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the Tuesday evening before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Barry  Everingham went to the office of the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  to give some personal information to a staff member, Miss Lorraine Hoare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On Tuesday,  28  November  1972, 4  days before the holding of a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, when the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  was not in this Parliament but out on the hustings, a journalist was found in the locked room of the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can any honourable member of this Parliament - be he or she a member of the House of Representatives or of this Senate - excuse a person from being in the locked room of a prominent member of this Parliament - the then Leader of the Opposition -  4  days before a general <span class="highlight">election</span> is held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When those events happened  4  days before a general <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, I say frankly that if they be the facts - let us face the fact that the  Speaker  of the  House  of Representatives and you,  Mr President,  have examined all the files and all the facts and have heard  Mr  Everingham’s explanation - and if they be not proved otherwise, the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and you,  Sir, would  have been recreant to the trust imposed in you bv this Parliament in protecting the rights and traditions of the Parliament and of its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we bear in mind that this transpired  4  days before a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, when the then Leader of the Opposition was not in this Parliament building but was out on the hustings far away from this place, we must ask what excuse could any person who was not a member of that honourable gentleman’s staff have for being in his room even it was unlocked? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-59">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the ‘This Day Tonight’ program which has been telecast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Hobart since the last Tasmanian State <span class="highlight">election</span> has been under the control of a producer called  Mr Holgate  who was a defeated Australian Labor Party candidate at that <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at the Labor Party’s first Federal Budget in 23 years, one cannot blame the cynicism of the average Australian, who says that he takes the promises of political parties with a grain of salt and who thinks that no matter what a party may promise at <span class="highlight">election</span> time it will do much as it pleases once it is in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-46-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It claims a mandate because these schemes were announced as Labor Party policy during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-46-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not broken any <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite can distort things in any way they like, but we have not broken any <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Senate is of the opinion that the Government has failed to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in respect of defence, per capita grants to independent schools, pensioners, company taxation, the revision of taxation burdens, the home owner, its claim to come to government with malice towards none and its subsequent unfair discrimination against the rural community and its disregard of inflationary pressures and that this budget therefore deserves condemnation in the Senate as the budget of a government that has exposed itself as a government of double standards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  made promises to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>, without regard to the possible effect on the country’s economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To show the difference between what  Mr Crean  would have liked and what was forced on him by his Leader’s pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises, let us look at the question of income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have dealt with this elsewhere and I do not propose to spend much time on it except to say that when one considers the millions of dollars that are being lavished in other directions it would not have taken much for the Government tb have decided it would carry out  Mr Whitlam’s  promise that no aid being given before the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be ended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thousands and thousands of dollars were collected prior to the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> from manufacturers in my State of Victoria by a senior representative of the Australian Labor Party, who told them that if Labor got into office it would safeguard the tariff system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be of no use for the Labor Party at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> to seek the votes of the East European migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth reiterating that he drew attention to the fact that the Government was implementing energetically many of its <span class="highlight">election</span> undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that sense what the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy was that he was going to establish a much firmer and stronger public sector and put it in a primary position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was his promise in the teeth of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The question which he directed to me on Tuesday was whether the advertising agency which did the ‘Its Time’ publicity campaign for the Australian Labor Party at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> was the advertising agency which carried out the health advertising on behalf of the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, is it proposed to ignore the statements by all conservation authorities - although the Minister is not prepared to listen now he was willing to capitalise on this before the <span class="highlight">election</span> - that the Galston area must be preserved in its natural state? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was a gap of about 6 months in our sittings between September last year and April this year due to the intervention of an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the rather belated reconstitution of the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the present law a marketing authority which acquires ownership of goods it exports or sells for export may, within 60 days of coming into existence, make an <span class="highlight">election</span> which gives it the right to have these goods taken into account for the purpose of ascertaining its export grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed amendments will enable an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be made by an authority whether or not it acquires ownership of the goods it exports and will also remove the 60-day limit for making an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> made after the commencement of the amending Act may, at the option of the authority, apply from as early as the commencement of the 1971-72 grant year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is vitally important because an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory will be held in about October next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one of the first matters the Committee will consider is the constitution as it stands and it’ will endeavour to bring down a recommendation to this Parliament that it should give the people of the Northern Territory a fully elected Legislative Council at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Traditionally the Budget would reflect not only the philosophy of the government of the day but essentially the policies which it brought to the people either at <span class="highlight">election</span> time or from the public platform afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No budget which has appeared before this Parliament in its history has contained such a string of broken promises and on no previous occasion has there been such a failure to implement <span class="highlight">election</span> undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will have something to say now about this matter because of the wilful misrepresentation of this Government when seeking <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>in defiance of its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy, it attempted to introduce compulsory unionism for Commonwealth public servants; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was held to its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to give 4 weeks leave to all public servants, not only to those who were prepared to join unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The particular person I had in mind was a Labor Party candidate at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> who went on television to justify and sustain what she was doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  has stated, this Bill has 2 purposes- to apply to regular servicemen the rehabilitation and retraining benefits which have applied in the past to national servicemen, and to put into legislative form Labor’s preelection promise to pay a re-engagement bonus of $1,000 after 6 years of service on the basis of a further 3 years of service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of great wonder to me that this double-dealing Government, after slashing the Defence vote from its promised 3.5 per cent to 3.2 per cent of the gross national product, to 2.9 per cent, effectively removing the teeth from our defence forces, has the gall to grandstand on this Bill that it is honouring an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise by providing these benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730911_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was desperate just prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> to eliminate unemployment in the Australian community, unemployment that it had created by its fiscal policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It pumped large sums of money into circulation in the last half of 1972, before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, to try to stem the tide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> unemployment and inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, honourable senators opposite would have the people who are listening to the broadcast of these proceedings and honourable senators in the chamber believe that inflation has been manufactured by the Australian Labor Party and that its rate of acceleration has been caused by the fact that the Australian Labor Party won the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was talked about by the Labor Party before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and it was certainly one of the reasons which gained us a lot of support- and now we are carrying out that policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam,  the Leader of this Government, said when seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> that what the Labor Party would do would be to hold a conference of Federal and State governments, industry and trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What a comparison with what  Mr Lynch  said before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Within a few days of the <span class="highlight">election</span> a 2-man Ministry was constituted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> there was no mention by the Government, which presented itself as a centralist government, of any need to cooperate with the States or of any necessity that the Commonwealth would have to call others in aid in order to handle the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a matter of very great seriousness that so soon after a general <span class="highlight">election</span>- in the first Budgetthe Government is now vulnerable to these charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the Australian people, adverting to this Budget, to the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and to the parliamentary protestations about the program and performance of the Government, will very quickly gain an acute awareness of the Government in Canberra today and that when the opportunity arises they will seize that opportunity and, in view of the Government’s performance, dismiss the Government as it deserves to be dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the last <span class="highlight">election</span> Labor’s approach to the people was on the basis of stopping handouts being given to political friends throughout the community, and we have been criticised for doing this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have that obligation because that is what we said in our <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> now for the House of Representatives, even with only the normal half of the Senate due for <span class="highlight">election</span> before July next, would bring the 2 Houses back into gear and avoid the burden of so many Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What the Budget did was to give effect to some- I repeat some- of Labor’s pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister’s announcement of a cut in defence expenditure in terms of its relationship to the gross national product blatantly broke a pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise and placed the security of Australia in jeopardy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party has been crowing from one end of Australia to the other that its <span class="highlight">election</span> victory last December gave it a mandate to do just about everything one can conceive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor made a crystal clear promise during the <span class="highlight">election</span> that it would maintain defence expenditure at between 3.2 per cent and 3.5 per cent of the gross national product. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That happened just before the 1963 <span class="highlight">election</span> and the decision was no more than an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is in the face of the Labor <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that this would not happen, that it would not be necessary, because of growth in Government revenue on a regressive taxation system with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators opposite protest that they are interested in seeing the galloping rate of inflation brought to a stop, but the candidate they are supporting for the Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span> has said that inflation is just a big joke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The actual realisation of anticipated spending in the Australian economy fell to its third lowest level in 30 years and that surely indicates that the confidence that was displayed by investors shortly after the <span class="highlight">election</span> has been tempered by caution completely inconsistent with market conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By means of his amendment,  Senator Withers  wants the Senate to add these words at the end of  Senator Willesee  ‘s motion: but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government has failed to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in respect of defence, per capita grants to independent schools, pensioners . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will deal, firstly, with the Government’s alleged failure to carry out its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises regarding per capita grants to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one of the Opposition senators has tried to show where any Labor member of Parliament said prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> that a Labor government would continue per capita grants to independent schools indefinitely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no doubt at all about what was said by the Prime Minister in the sensational <span class="highlight">election</span> speech delivered at the Blacktown Civic Centre on 13 November 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of Opposition senators and so that when a vote is taken on this issue they will vote either for the truth of what was said in the <span class="highlight">election</span> speech delivered by the Prime Minister or for what is alleged by  Senator McManus  to have been said, I shall read to the Senate what the Prime Minister said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Summing up the points he had made on this subject in his <span class="highlight">election</span> speech, the Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech of the present Prime Minister delivered in November of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government has completely honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy regarding education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matter which  Senator Withers  mentioned was the Government’s failure to carry out its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in respect of pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Prime Minister told the Australian people that if a Labor Government were elected he would give an immediate increase of $1.50 a week to pensioners and then would give an increase of $1.50 a week every spring and autumn until the pension rate reached at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look through this table it is not very hard to determine in which year a general <span class="highlight">election</span> was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The table shows that in the year in which an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held the rate of pension was increased and also that in the year before and the year after that <span class="highlight">election</span> an increase was not made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in 1966 the rate of pension was increased by 75c but in 1965 and 1967- the years before and after the <span class="highlight">election</span>- there was nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same applied in other elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1962, the year following the <span class="highlight">election</span> year of 1 96 1 in which there was an increase of 50c, nothing was given in the way of a pension increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is a very sinister reflection through the table showing that the previous Government gave increases only in <span class="highlight">election</span> years as a political gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures that I have quoted prove beyond all doubt that the Government has honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge in regard to pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the figures I have given, particularly those showing the improvement and increases in pensions that have flowed since the Labor Government took office in December last year, show conclusively that the promises made prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> have been completely honoured; and the policy speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  shows, I believe, that prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> no undertaking was given by either the Prime Minister or the present Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  that a Labor Government, if elected, would continue the per capita grants to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not propose to deal with what he said except to refer to one statement he made to the effect that the Government has honoured all its promises since the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of a new Government and the implementation of its policies have involved administrative reorganisation and a rise in the demands on the Australian Information Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730918_senate_28_s57/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that even before the <span class="highlight">election</span> our proposals to introduce the rule of law into economic affairs were put in a fairly great deal of detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the appropriate approach is to recognise what the Australian Labor Party said before it was elected to government and what it highlighted in its <span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not look at the host of promises which were made at <span class="highlight">election</span> time and the way in which they are being dishonoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has been criticising the Government because of inflation, but when it was in government for 23 years it did nothing about inflation except, as  Senator Greenwood  pointed out this afternoon, on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 when it decided to pour money into the economy because the economy needed a boost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only coincidental that the hot breath of the Australian people was on its neck and it was facing an <span class="highlight">election</span> in a few months time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government did one thing in 23 years- it poured some money into the economy on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the money which the previous Government poured into the economy to try to win the <span class="highlight">election</span> is what this Government is facing up to at this very moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation was aggravated by the last minute desperate measures of the Government in pouring money into the economy to try to build up support for its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then it tried to get out of the situation on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> by pouring money into the economy as fast as it could. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an <span class="highlight">election</span> had not been pending it would have allowed well over 2 per cent unemployed at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the troubles we are experiencing at the present time have been brought about by the present Government in its outbidding of the previous Government to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to look at what was said by some of the members of the Labor Party who are now Ministers during that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party made this promise during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in an endeavour to outbid the previous Government, and this is why it is in trouble now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Pary, before taking office, made an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that it would increase the benefits provided under the Commonwealth employees compensation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I admit that if it was an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, this Government would want further to bump up the benefits, and I have no objection to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that the Government in an endeavour to honour the promises which it made in an attempt to outbid the previous Government during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, found itself in difficulties in framing the present Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has it been just because there has been a change of government or has it been as a consequence of the fact that during the course of the general <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Labor Party announced as part of its policy speech that it intended to deal with inflation and that it intimated precisely what it intended to do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By its very promises made before its <span class="highlight">election</span> this Government induced a higher rate of inflation at the moment the people entrusted it with government, because people expected prices to go up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was rather amazed by a statement made recently by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in which he treated the problem in such a flippant way that one of the papers which was a strong supporter of his prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> took him to task for the flippancy with which he dealt with this very serious problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only a few days after  Mr Crean  said this that the ‘Australian’ newspaper, which for some strange reason that I can never account for advocated the cause of the Labor Party prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole point is that honourable senators on the opposite side are probably responsible in the main for the tremendous inflationary spiral which is now occurring as a result of the desperation on the part of the then Government 4 months before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> to try to do something to stop the political tide running against it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because he could not stop that growing swell of unemployment, 4 months before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> he brought down another Budget in a desperate attempt to push money into the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He roped in every section of the economy in an attempt to score political capital merely for the Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A year later a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> was held an unfortunately the Liberal and Country Parties won it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the very issue on which the won the <span class="highlight">election</span> was the promise of the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Menzies,  to put value back into the pound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was an economic recession in 1961 when at a general <span class="highlight">election</span> they were re-elected with a mere majority of 240 votes in one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a desperate attempt to plug the crack, 4 months before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, last year the previous Government pumped dollar after dollar into the community by spending money here, there and everywhere as if it was bidding at an auction sale. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It lost the <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in its desperate attempts to retrieve the political situation it would exacerbate the problem of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, one of the things I have noted about the Labor Party in recent years is that it is always socialist except before an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first Saturday after that date- a Saturday is the usual day for an <span class="highlight">election</span> or a referendumwould be 24 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed quite ironical to me that the Government, claiming to have the confidence of the people following last year’s <span class="highlight">election</span> should now be admitting that its course of action has created absolute chaos in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has used inflation to implement its extravagant policies which were promised during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government must have been well aware, not because of the long history of inflation but because of statements made since it gained office and in particular in the fortnight before it sought <span class="highlight">election</span> that one of its great problems would be to control the economy of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also abolished national service in fulfilment of an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also increased the level of pensions and social service payments in accordance with another <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ls it the Government that was elected in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cheaper houses was one of the main slogans of the Australian Labor Party at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither in the years before it sought power and came to power, nor in its policy speech, nor in its <span class="highlight">election</span> announcements, nor in the 9 and a half months since its <span class="highlight">election</span> has it ever mentioned its lack of power to control inflation or its need to seek a further power by referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trying to establish an alibi for the Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is trying to establish an alibi against the fact that in the not too far distant future it has to meet its masters, at least in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knows that if it goes on with its reckless and irresponsible mismanagement of the economy it may well have to meet the electors of Australia in a lower House <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the fact is that this was not foreshadowed prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in any statement by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party or any of his people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that one of the great arguments of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was the centralisation or abuse of powers or the decentralisation of powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite Labor senators to answer this: Is it not true that at no time prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> did they say they wanted centralised price control? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party sought no mandate or power, either before or after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, in relation to this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister for Repatriation, who represents the Minister for Labour in this chamber, by saying that prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> members of the Australian Labor Party were saying that under a Whitlam Government there would be less industrial unrest because Labor knew more about the way unions worked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the reintroduction of the Bill, the Government demonstrates its determination to adhere to its policies, as announced before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, and to which the Australian people gave their stamp of approval on 2 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to congratulate the Minister for Social Security,  Mr Bill  Hayden, and the Government for honouring the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and also for giving top priority to this social service legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are 2 promises that the Government made during its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and it has already placed very high on its order of priorities means of fulfilling them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I respectfully remind  Senator Webster  that the Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span> is over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can remember when  Senator Townley  came into this chamber a few days after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 on the Senate team ticket at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, we always find him over with the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Keeffe  said, as soon as we got into office our first piece of legislation dealt with social welfare pensions and repatriation payments which were made retrospective to the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He makes the point in his letter to me that there was no mandate, as far as he can see, for this, that it was not mentioned during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and that while there might be an argument for action in certain limited cases there are other cases under the special compensation allowance for which he believes it could have been continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said the RSL congratulated the Government on the introduction of long overdue measures which were in line with promises the Prime Minister had made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood from the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda that that was the Government’s responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Labor Party said during the <span class="highlight">election</span> was that it needed no more powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Despite the boasting of the Labor Party prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> that it could handle the trade unions, industrial unrest is at an all time high. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will be aware that the Government decided, and announced in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that steps would be taken to release persons who had been imprisoned under the National Service Act, that it would not proceed with the various prosecutions which were in hand and that fines which had been paid would be remitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-If the Leader of ..the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  thinks that the Government can repeat the December general <span class="highlight">election</span> result, he should have his Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  go over to Yarralumla and ask the Governor-General for a double dissolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we will have another general <span class="highlight">election</span> with the referendum on 15 December, if the Government wants it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>result of the Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span> will not be repeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span> has shown that the people of Australia have had the Government up to the neck. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting to recall that last Saturday an <span class="highlight">election</span> took place in the middle of all the debate and publicity that has been going on in connection with the prices referendum; but apparently it did not win any votes for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span> proved that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were chalked up before the Australian electors knew what tricks the Labor Party had up its sleeve as opposed to the tricks it pulled out of the hat on the <span class="highlight">election</span> platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let it take a double dissolution and call a general <span class="highlight">election</span> at the same time as the referendum in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period from 1955 to 1961, when the DLP was first operating, we always made it a principle of our <span class="highlight">election</span> speeches to insist that the item of most importance to Australia was Australia’s defences and security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We formed that conclusion, and we made it the first item of our <span class="highlight">election</span> policy because of the kind of world in which we were living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1961 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign about the only thing on which the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party agreed - they disagreed on practically everything- was that the defence vote could continue to be pegged and that there was no necessity for Australia to improve its defences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who look back through history will recall that prior to Hitler’s war and the war in which we were involved with Japan,  Mr Baldwin,  the Prime Minister of Great Britain, held an <span class="highlight">election</span> and at that time he hardly mentioned defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that all the Parties on this side of the chamber paid the penalty at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> when they allowed themselves to be conned into the idea that defence would not be a good issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it will be an issue at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I were to take a text for this debate, I would take the words used by  Mr Barnard,  the Minister for Defence, in a major <span class="highlight">election</span> address to the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre of the Australian National University in March of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee brought down its findings and I assure honourable senators that we had been given an assurance before we went to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that once the Treasury and the Department of Defence had investigated the recommendations - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Following that inquiry, a proceeding was taken under part 15 of the Customs Act at the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Sir John  Pagan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Davies,  the member for Braddon, and I, as a candidate in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at that time, also attended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This implements the promises made by the Government at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second Bill provided for the continued payment of age, invalid and widows pensions to Australian pensioners proceeding overseas, as promised in the Prime Minister’s  (Mr Whitlam)  <span class="highlight">election</span> speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in the several States or at the same time as the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their <span class="highlight">election</span> until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general <span class="highlight">election</span> for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first <span class="highlight">election</span> for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>; and for the Territory senators to be elected under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fifteen years ago the Constitutional Review Committee, upon which all parties were represented, recommended that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the senators every time there was a general <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bringing elections for Territory senators into line with House of Representatives elections accords with the recommendation of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed that the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Territory senators will take place at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> or at the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives if such takes place sooner that the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731009_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Premier of South Australia remind the Minister of the undertaking he gave to the wine industry of South Australia as State  Chairman  of the Australian Labor Party Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> Finance Committee that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government would save increased excise costs in the future? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>provision will be made to further strengthen the democratic processes in relation to union elections by providing that all full-time federal officers in an organisation must be elected by direct <span class="highlight">election</span> of the members of the organisation and that the only officers who can be elected by the collegiate system shall be parttime officers of an organisation’s federal management committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731010_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A State <span class="highlight">election</span> is coming up in New South Wales, and the New South Wales Government, if it wanted to do so, could do a lot more to settle that dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The members of the Labor Party in New South Wales, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Hills,  want to end that dispute, irrespective of the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> and the politics involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In connection with the functions of the Commission, honourable senators will recall that the need for social planning at the regional level was recognised in a major <span class="highlight">election</span> proposal, the Australian Assistance Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731011_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the importance of ascertaining and publishing the true facts for proper assessment by the Parliament and by the Australian people, will the Federal Government produce as a matter of some urgency a White Paper or a considered statement in particular, clarifying the repeated allegations that the Allende Government in the latter part of its period of office had abandoned democratic processes, the basis of its <span class="highlight">election</span>, and was imposing dictatorial and totalitarian methods upon the Chilean people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding what was said in the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">election</span> program, there has been an increase in industrial disputation and the losses caused thereby in the period that the present Government has been in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last November, before the December <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Whitlam  promised that there would be an effecting of the aims of Labor’s industrial policy, which were to reduce government interference and intervention in industrial matters; to put conciliation back into arbitration; to abolish the penal clauses which made strikes in Australia, alone in the English speaking world, a criminal offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731016_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact is that the Bill dealing with restrictive practices which has been introduced is of the same character as was indicated by me throughout the country on a number of ocasions last year before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and in a number of published articles and as has been indicated during this year even prior to the Bill coming in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the <span class="highlight">election</span>, with the parties now sitting on different sides of the chamber, certain Government supporters in another place- I am not saying that it occurred in this chamber- have commenced to make allegations that the Senate is obstructive and unco-operative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is why senators were elected and why they sought <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the <span class="highlight">election</span> my Party said that it would do a number of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  who was speaking in Tasmania with the authority of the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said that if a Labor government gained office it was his view that he would be the Minister for Environment and Conservation, and he gave an assurance to the people of Tasmania that a feasibility study would be carried out on the restoration of Lake Pedder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have said that after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> I indicated on a number of occasions, orally and in writing, the general outlines of the new legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he also aware of the fact that one Country Party member of the State Parliament has been informed that his re-endorsement for the next <span class="highlight">election</span> is in jeopardy unless he bows his knee to the outside directions of his Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731018_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember that just prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> a decision was made to use timber sleepers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government in December, alternative tenders for both types of sleepers were called and the tenders received were submitted to the Bureau of Transport Economics for evaluation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what happened here last week and what is happening at the moment on the lawns in front of Parliament House is an indication that the present Government is certainly bungling some of the promises that it made in its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign so far as Aborigines are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where fines had been paid before 2 December, the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, I think they were not repaid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was interested to note that last year during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the problem of Tasmania was recognised by the now Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  who as the then Leader of the Opposition said that a Labor government would work to make freight and passenger service rates across Bass Strait as cheap per mile as interstate railway freights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before I retail to the listening audience what has transpired in this debate I want to remind the Senate and the Australian community that in the policy speech of my leader preceding the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government on 2 December 1972 we gave a commitment in respect of prices in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-We see that the answer from the Attorney-General is not that the publicity was wrong, that this company was one of the Government’s greatest contributors or that the American multi-national advertising agency that the Labor Party engaged to do its publicity work during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when in fact - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am looking for the statement that was made on this matter at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will refer to this matter again when I can turn up what was said in the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One honourable senator is saying ‘the next Budget’ and another one is saying ‘the next <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that there is anything magical about a Budget and I do not think that there is anything magical about an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is nothing very magical about 30 June, a Budget or an <span class="highlight">election</span> date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee is finally established with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 41 representatives, do the positions of Aboriginal State co-ordinators then become redundant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, it has been able to say to him: ‘We will give you $25,000 for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign but you have to promise that there will be no prosecutions under the penal clauses’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of the wealthy organisations of this country were beguiled into supporting the Australian Labor Party at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of officially conducted ballots is to prevent irregularities that occur in elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is possible to challenge the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> by an independent returning officer who is responsible for conducting all stages of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the whole purpose of officially conducted ballots is undermined and their conduct is subject to uncertainty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the Minister would have the right to refer anything to the industrial court we do acknowledge that as the Bill now stands the Attorney-General is the man responsible for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of judges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will not accept the amendment to section 168, the provisions of which provide that the Attorney-General may authorise payment by the Commonwealth of the expenses involved in an officially conducted <span class="highlight">election</span> ordered by the Court after its inquiry into irregularities alleged in connection with the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sub-section (4) would be unnecessary because under the Bill the expenses of all officially conducted elections are to be borne by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party and the Country Party- as well as the Democratic Labor Party- have a vested interest in creating and maintaining industrial turmoil in Australia for the very reason that their re-<span class="highlight">election</span> as a government could depend greatly upon there being chaos in industrial affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see this happening in New South Wales today because a State <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731106_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although preliminary work on the prices reference was carried out before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the new Government last December, the Committee decided to defer any further action in this field in order to see what would be done by the Government in terms of its declared policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second thing is that so many people are scared of being defeated at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> that the bed - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition wishes to fight another <span class="highlight">election</span> in which it uses the ‘little red arrows’ technique, those arrows should come down not from China but from Japan, as that country will come down here again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was one of the debates which took place in particular during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question was one of the very important and foremost matters put by the present Government during that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-school education is a matter that was referred to in both of the policy speeches before the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing that I believe has to be said- this has to be repeated- is that the policy which has been put forward in the Schools Commission Bill 1973 is Australian Labor Party policy which was well known and clearly presented to the Australian people before they voted in the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument advanced against the proposition that the Schools Commission should be a type of delegate or representative body- I was one of those who sucessfully argued for the policy which was adopted at the Labor Party conferencewas that in having a schools commission which consisted of a certain number of delegates from private schools, a certain number from state schools and all the other possible permutations and combinations that one could think of, we would not have a quasi-judicial body looking over all the needs of education without somebody being responsible to someone else and being responsible for <span class="highlight">election</span> or nomination to some organisation or interest group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly introducing something totally different from what has been proposed in the Bill which is something on which the Australian Labor Party was elected at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government, when its members occupied the opposition benches last year, gave notice of its intention, should it win the <span class="highlight">election</span>, to bring down legislation for a permanent Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that soon after its <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government appointed an Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission charged with the responsibility of identifying deficiencies in government and nongovernment schools and to suggest how these should be overcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was highlighted in the <span class="highlight">election</span> speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and it was something about which the Labor Party, while in Opposition, talked for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the <span class="highlight">election</span> I heard the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  at the West Melbourne Stadium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement was echoed by the shadow Minister for Education,  Mr Beazley,  on more than one occasion during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my comments later I said that the honourable thing for the Government to do was to maintain the level of aid which had been given to all students prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> and then to implement in the future the needs provision for which the Australian Labor Party believed it had a mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want to be regarded as people who make <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and then flout them or break them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is most important because, of all the principal parties that contested the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972, the Australian Labor Party was the only party which gave sufficient attention to this matter to warrant the consideration of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me read the policy of the Country Party at the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the policy of the Country Party which was put to the people of Australia at the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the policy that the Country Party put before the people of Australia at the 1972 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the magnificent policy which the Liberal Party put to the people of Australia in the 1972 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was not until the Government came to an <span class="highlight">election</span> that it realised that that was the problem and consequently it said: ‘We need better schools’ and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But you came to an <span class="highlight">election</span> and you said you were going to give $400 for each child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having said that, I acknowledge also that the promise to establish an Australian Schools Commission was made by the Australian Labor Party last year both to a great extent in the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and in its policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My own filing system is full of such requests; in fact, I had many such delegations put the proposition to me both before and after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go further and say that if the Labor Government of the day rejects these amendments proposed by the Opposition it will be doing so not only in petulance but also in defiance of its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> indications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representations were made to the Karmel Committee so it must be understood that these amendments proposed by the Opposition now are not in any way a frustration of the <span class="highlight">election</span> policies of the Government or of the requests of the education bodies but are in fact an earnest of their fulfilment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government rejects them, it rejects its <span class="highlight">election</span> policies and the representations by the various teacher bodies, parent bodies and special handicapped children’s organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that our amendments relating to the structure of the Schools Commision foreshadow the promise given by the Labor Party before the <span class="highlight">election</span> to have a specifically structured commission representing particular educational interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the amendments put forward by the Opposition we are not only reflecting the <span class="highlight">election</span> policies of the Labor Party and the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> and post-<span class="highlight">election</span> requests of educational interests, but also we are reflecting the recommendations and decisions of the Karmel Committee because throughout its report these recommendations run like a uniform thread. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will be aware that in the policy speech of the Prime Minister delivered before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Party undertook to increase pensions at the rate of $1.50 in each sessional period of the Parliament until the value of pensions had reached 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the time would be given according to the percentage of votes won by parties at the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> and further that once the limit for each party was reached in relation to the time factor that party would be unable to continue advertising regardless of any money that it may have to spend? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be reasonable for political advertisements to have some authorisation even apart from that required during any <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, but we have not yet felt the necessity for this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have candidates for the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee <span class="highlight">election</span> on 24 November not been informed whether their nominations have been accepted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say that I had a pretty unhappy experience as a member on the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House to the extent that I was elected to that Committee in 1966; I sat at one meeting of the Committee which decided to ask all the parliamentary departments what accommodation space they required in the proposed house; and while those letters of inquiry went out to those departments we had an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and my Party did not see fit to reappoint me to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had none of the elections and double dissolutions that would justify a joint sitting of the House passing any resolution which, in the terms of the final part of section 57, once resolved shall be taken to be duly passed by both Houses of the Parliament and shall be presented to the Queen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing that applies to any situation other than that of a double dissolution followed by an <span class="highlight">election</span> followed by a joint sitting under section 57. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was left on the notice paper over in the other place for a long time but it was removed before Parliament was prorogued before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we have a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> next April, or whenever it might be, perhaps 30 people now in this place will not be here after it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span> and as recently as the last 2 weeks, he has made representations to all Ministers concerned for completion of the Bundaberg irrigation scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I ask the Minister for the Media whether the increased level of interest about Australia in the United States of America, which was very evident around the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year from the amount of space devoted to this country in American magazines, is being maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLANDFirstly, since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government the Prime Minister has visited the United States of America and as a result of that visit there was tremendous publicity for Australia in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is doing by way of its amendments is twofold: It is translating in the amendment form for adoption by the Senate those propositions put forward by parent and teacher bodies which prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> were acknowledged and supported by Labor Party members who therefore tacitly indicated that these propositions would be part of Labor policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a Bill which arises out of <span class="highlight">election</span> policies and out of the Interim Committee for the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to structure what we propose by way of amendments is wholly in line with <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and undertakings and with submissions by education bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no evidence of this support, of course, during the 1972 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless, there was no evidence of that support during the course of the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when it was the foremost plank of the Labor Party that when we got into government we would establish a schools commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nine days after the <span class="highlight">election</span> was held the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  established an interim committee to consider the establishment of a schools commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> proposal on education was to establish a schools commission along the lines of the commissions for universities and colleges of advanced education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the points to which 1 have alluded cover a great number of particular matters, as we see it the significance of the proposed Opposition amendments to the functions of the Commission and to the matters to be taken into account in the exercise of those functions as set out in clause 13 of the Bill is to vary the intention of the Government as endorsed by the electorate at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its policy as enunciated by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  during the course of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> has shown this concern as have the actions since taken by this Government from its very first establishment and its legislative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This scheme was sold to the people at <span class="highlight">election</span> time on a primary basis which was: ‘We the Labor Party will be able to handle the doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Treasurer justify this request having regard to (a) the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises of the Government to assist the home buyer; (b) the failure to honour the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to make mortgage interest payments tax deductible; and (c) the abolition of the Home Savings Grant Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, will he explain the reason for secrecy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I told him that it was Government policy, in accordance with an <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking given by the Prime Minister, that in each session of the Parliament the Australian Government would increase the subvention payable to pensioners by $ 1 .50 a week until the pension reached 25 per cent of the average weekly male earnings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that people forget, particularly the juvenile Press that we have about the country today, is that this Senate derives its constitution from the people of this country and it derives its <span class="highlight">election</span> from the votes of the people of this country- the same people who elect members to the other chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We may say the painting is no good or that too much has been paid for it but we will deal with that at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that there is a strong possibility at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> that the people of Canberra will have 2 members of the Liberal Party representing them, judging from what I have heard about the present member for the Australian Capital Territory who sits in another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill proposes that such senators will have the same powers, immunities and privileges as State senators and that both senators for each Territory will be elected under a system of proportional representation at the time of each general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives, provided that the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Territory senators will be held at the time of the next <span class="highlight">election</span> of State senators if such is held prior to a general <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the 60 State senators would be elected for a period of 3 years instead of the present 6 years to tie in with elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because this Bill proposes that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators take place at the same time as elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This puts the Country Party’s policy for the State <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held in New South Wales this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that they will take this country to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, but I feel confident in my own mind that they lack the necessary intestinal fortitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he comes up for <span class="highlight">election</span> in Victoria in the next 6 or 8 months he will have to find some 300,000 first preference votes before he is elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is his view that they should be referred at the time of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the Senate and the House of Representatives should always go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> jointly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion that there should not be elections every 18 months or so, one for the Senate and one for the House of Representatives, must appeal to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the people of Australia threw out the referendum conducted by the previous Government to break the nexus, I sincerely hope that they will throw out this referendum which will attempt to have elections for the 2 Houses put into line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That in itself is another proposition designed by this Government to weaken the Senate and to see that the Senate does not stand out as a House of importance when Federal elections are held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the <span class="highlight">election</span> date for the Senate that needs to be brought back into kilter with the <span class="highlight">election</span> date for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A previous Prime Minister called an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives half way through a Senate term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> date that needs to be put back into kilter with the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those proud members of the Labor Party were to rise- they now have the opportunityand ask for an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives next May, at the same time as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, they would save the people a great deal of bother and money and would save putting a great deal of strain on the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The kernel of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill, which my illustrious leader has submitted to the Senate, provides for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and for such senators to have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators who represent the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that the States would consider that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators to represent the Territories would in certain ways weaken their strength in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I was most interested to hear the approbation which came from people about the work of the Senate, its committees and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For sure at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government not only increased the pension by $ 1.50 in the Budget session but also, as I said yesterday, by $ 1 .50 in the first session of this Parliament after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I remember rightly, this Government at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> said that it was keen on the tourist industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They hope that if they repeat often enough their claim that we are penalising the poor widows and the poor outback man somebody may believe them enough to cast a vote for them at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This implements the promises made by the Government at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The period before an <span class="highlight">election</span> is preserved by laws from abuse so far as television stations are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right on the eve of the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the New South Wales Parliament the honourable senator has taken advantage of privilege, for prearranged publication in the Press, of this sort of ex parte accusation 2 days before an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which will prevent the person accused not merely from having the right to reply in this place but from having any real opportunity to reply in the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that a senator who so abuses the privilege of the Federal Parliament, without notice to a man who has submitted his whole reputation on this very matter to the scrutiny of the Supreme Court of New South Wales within the last fortnight, and expects the Press of the country to be so depraved in principle as to print prominent accusations of this sort a day before an <span class="highlight">election</span>, so timed as to prevent the person accused having any real right of reply, is acting in an abysmally depraved manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This false allegation was based in anonymity and uttered in malice under parliamentary privilege to try to help his New South Wales Labor colleagues in Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen  Senator Gietzelt  speaking in relation to pistol licences,  Senator Wheeldon  making allegations of bribery, and  Senator Mulvihill  making accusations against  Mr McCaw,  all at question time in the week before an <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if it be that this is an accusation made by design with malice for electioneering purposes, irrespective of the harm it does to individuals, it is the basest and most contemptible sort of actions that individuals can engage in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought it might be relevant if I drew attention to the fact that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to take place in New South Wales, strangely enough, within a couple of days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded of the fact that the last time similar tactics were engaged in in this chamber was immediately prior to the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply point to the fact that the 2 occasions on which this Senate has been treated as it has this evening have been in the few days before an <span class="highlight">election</span> in a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One was in relation to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland and now it is an <span class="highlight">election</span> in relation to New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But honourable senators, after admitting that they were serious accusations, said that they were raised for the purpose of some publicity on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to let corruption go on because there is a State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we obtain knowledge of those serious accusations, and knowledge that someone is doing something underhand which is not his public duty, should we let him continue without exposing him because there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> pending? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should there be a free and open go on crookedness just because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is pending somewhere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a desire to use this information for an <span class="highlight">election</span> purpose, is there not a responsibility on a member to make this plain before voters innocently decide how to cast their vote as to who their representative will be without knowing of the activities of a certain candidate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is there not a responsibility, if it is on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, to show this? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if  Senator Gietzelt  has succeeded and there is some malpractice on the pan of an individual who is a candidate for an <span class="highlight">election</span>, what is wrong? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested that there should not be this investigation because something might come out before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are plain points which should receive wide publicity, even if it is for the purpose of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, because we should not support corruption getting into our Australian Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say ‘You should not bring it up because it is so near an <span class="highlight">election</span> ‘ is simply rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must also now include in that category  Senator Rae  because he made some reference that a similar matter was introduced on the eve of the Queensland elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall speaking some months ago- true, it was on the eve of the Queensland elections, but that was coincidentaland I spoke to the subject on which I did speak because the Standing Orders of the Parliament provided me with that opportunity when the States Grants Bill was before this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They challenged me and made all sorts of accusations that I was using it for political purposes on the eve of a State <span class="highlight">election</span>, that I had produced no proof to the Senate and that I was not able to document the evidence and place it before the chamber as proof of what I was saying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he make inquiries, and advise the Senate when the information is available, as to whether it is true, as indicated in the Launceston ‘Examiner’ of Monday, 19 November, that the Prime Minister travelled, presumably by Royal Australian Air Force VIP aircraft, on Saturday, 1 7 November, from Adelaide to Sydney to record his vote at the State <span class="highlight">election</span> and continued to Launceston, arriving one hour late for his appointment at an agricultural show? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I introduce a Bill to alter the Constitution so as to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is one of 5 measures which the Government intends to put before the people by way of referendum at the time of the next Seriate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the national Parliament in the 1 1 year period December 1961 to December 1972 we have had 8 national elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only one of these electionsthat in December 1961- was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do fundamentally question the present out of phase state of our electoral process, requiring us to conduct in each 3-year period one House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and one separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elections were put out of phase in 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill honours an <span class="highlight">election</span> commitment by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1958 and 1959 reports recommended that the terms of senators should be changed from 6 years, as they now are, to 2 terms of the House of Representatives, so that the elections for both Houses could take place simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal is simply that at each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, be it at the normal 3-year interval or earlier, half the Senate will also face the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is purely a transitional arrangement designed to adjust to the new system the terms of those existing senators whose terms expire on 30 June 1977 and the terms of those who will be elected at the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In normal circumstances, there will be elections for the House of Representatives in 1975, 1978 and 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed under the transitional arrangement that a currently sitting senator, whose term began in 1971 and would in accordance with present constitutional provision expire in 1977, will continue in office until the second House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> after the constitutional alteration comes into force, that is, until 1978 unless there is a double dissolution or early <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, a senator elected at the forthcoming Senate elections for service from 1 July 1974 will have a term running until the 1981 House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>- again unless there is a double dissolution or earlier <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we think that the alternative of reducing their term of service to certainly less than 6 years would be less than in accordance with the terms of their <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would, however, almost certainly mean that it would take longer to get to the point of simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future, under this legislation, the Australian Parliament will have the authority to make laws for determining the times and places of <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a logical consequence of bringing elections for both Houses of the Australian Parliament together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should be dealt with in such a way that if there were a rejection the constitutional processes could operate so that the Government could then bring them into the House of Representatives again in ample time before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that in 1 968 in the Senate, in my capacity then as Leader of the Opposition in this House, I initiated legislation to provide for the establishment of electorates within each State in which the number of people is, as nearly as practicable, the same, and to democratise the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the members of all Houses of State Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it is proposed that the people should decide- by referendum at the time of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, it will make it necessary for States to do away with the remaining cases where <span class="highlight">election</span> of members is by only a privileged class of voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the proposed amendment to the constitution which will be submitted to a referendum at the time of the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is to make funds available direct to the local government, both by way of grants and by loans at lower interest rates, so that urban and rural councils and other local government bodies can be freed from the straitened circumstances of the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was one of our <span class="highlight">election</span> undertakings and one of the first to be honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We accept that the Government has a mandate to carry out the general policy which was put forward at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my speech during the second reading stage I drew attention to the fact that not only did the Government in its policy speech indicate that it would set up a commission that was so structured as to have representation of various bodies but also throughout the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign it received representations from parent and teacher associations seeking their direct representation on such a body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed out that the Government is confronted with an amendment which is in line with its specific <span class="highlight">election</span> promise- no matter what kind of wording it may seek to use nowwhich is in line with its specific promise based on a policy platform at <span class="highlight">election</span> time and which is in line with the various parent and teacher organisations’ representations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It discharges the promise made at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what we are suggesting is quite in line with the policy speech of the Prime Minister delivered before the general <span class="highlight">election</span> in December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to the principle of this amendment which concerns the method of selection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1969 elections and in the elections up to 1972-1 do not say this in a disparaging way- I am certain that she was identified with the Democratic Labor Party, and she had every right to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a matter of fact, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> in which  Senator Kane  was successful I was cruising in my car around the electorate of Lowe and she was handing out Democratic Labor Party how-to-vote cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government is a government which has been elected in a democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> and it is entitled to make such decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite  Senator Rae’s  positive assertion the amendments, as we see them, are not in line with the policy objectives of the Government as set out by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  during the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have candidates for the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee <span class="highlight">election</span> on 24 November not been informed whether their nominations have been accepted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to advise candidates in the forthcoming National Aboriginal Consultative Committee elections that their nominations have been accepted was overlooked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 93 candidates are standing for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> will begin on Saturday 17 November with roving ballot boxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Static polling booths will be open on Saturday 24 November and the <span class="highlight">election</span> will end on Saturday 1 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian people are grateful for that and I agree with one point made by  Dr J.  F. Cairns on Sunday, that is, that if there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government would not win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister and his Ministers persist in their claims that the Senate is frustrating, obstructing, filibustering and delaying their vital legislation, there is only one honourable path for the Government to tread, that is, the path to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has had the power to call for a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> since 1 July 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was rebutted in the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span>, knocked down in the Balcatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in Western Australia, jumped on in the Greensborough byelection in Victoria, kicked in the head in the Parramatta by-<span class="highlight">election</span> and finally buried last Saturday in the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing system of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> being held separately and not synchronised, that situation would face any government at all that did not have a majority in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a new government came in, whatever may be its political colour, should the Senate Opposition be able to say: ‘We will knock out your major measures and then your only recourse is to abandon your legislative program which has been endorsed by the people and have another <span class="highlight">election</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No government which has been elected by the people to carry out a legislative program should be confronted by an Opposition which has not gone to that <span class="highlight">election</span> but which happens to have a majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the situation in the Senate has not changed, the Opposition can set about defeating the Government’s program and can say to the Government: ‘Your only recourse is to abandon what you are doing, break off your legislative program, and have another <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition says to the Government: ‘Abandon your legislative program and have another <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is anxious to ensure that the Schools Commission is realistically constructed and that it operates with the powers and functions which were suggested for it by the then Opposition, now the Government, prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> and for which the Government claims that it has a mandate to legislate, if it has a mandate at all, and which were promised so very clearly by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  when speaking on the general subject on 20 June 1 972 in an address to the Catholic Luncheon Club of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that their approach now is completely different from the attitude they adopted during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year when this matter became one of the major planks, if not the major plank, of the platform for <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Australian Labor Party speech for the last <span class="highlight">election</span> we said that we would embark upon the establishment of a Schools Commission along the same lines as the conservative governments had embarked upon the establishment of the Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Commission on Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, we say that this is yet another attempt by the Opposition to water down- I think I used the term ‘maul’ earlier- the national initiative of the Government in improving education throughout Australia which certainly was put to the electorate by the Labor Leader,  Mr Whitlam,  during the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and which certainly was endorsed by the electorate last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one refers to the Labor Party’s policies at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> one finds that we referred not only to the needs of schools but also to the needs of students and that concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As enunciated by the Labor leader at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, which probably was the main part of the Labor Party’s platform at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was certainly highlighted and certainly opposed by the Opposition at that <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government now endeavours to implement in this legislation which the Opposition seeks to amend and has amended or emasculated or mauled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  said at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore I suggest that nobody who has read the Government’s policy statements, especially the policy statement of the Prime Minister at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, in association with the report of the Interim Schools Committeethe Karmel Committee report- can suggest for one moment that the action which the Government is taking to assist schools will not be of direct benefit to students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hark back to the policy speech of the Labour Party at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that that is what the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  campaigned for at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of elections show that people who have campaigned on the basis of this kind of division have received a contemptuous vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me now refer to the statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in relation to schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the purpose of these amendments is to water down the needs concept which is basic to the Government’s approach that was enunciated by the Prime Minister before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and which was endorsed by the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator will appreciate, when I remind him, what  Mr Whitlam  said on behalf of the Labor movement in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if Aboriginal people do want such a committee (and this has not been established) the time allocated for preparing this <span class="highlight">election</span> is far too short- no State or Federal elections are run in such a short time with so little preparation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it is a shorter period, but we ran a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales which terminated last Saturday, I think, after about a 3-week campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It came together to discuss, mainly, the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a truly representative, fully Aboriginal consultative council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 56 people in the State of Queensland who do not agree with  Senator Bonner  who has nominated for this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not desirous of having an <span class="highlight">election</span> for which the Labor Party takes all the credit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that the Government has nothing to hide and nothing to apologise for in relation to the <span class="highlight">election</span> which is about to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister for the Media aware that on the night of Friday, 16 November- that is, the day before the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>- Channel 9 in Sydney on more than one occasion televised a short film showing a ballot box and a flag with the word ‘Liberal’ clearly marked on it and also showing the Premier,  Sir Robert  Askin, dropping a ballot paper into the ballot box while a voice reminded viewers to vote on the following day? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that what is known as a promo, a promotional advertisement, was shown by Channel 9 on Friday, 16 November, advertising the <span class="highlight">election</span> coverage of the station on the evening of the <span class="highlight">election</span> on Saturday, 17 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>I understand that it had a background voice reminding people that the next day was <span class="highlight">election</span> day and urging viewers to watch Channel 9 for the <span class="highlight">election</span> coverage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am prompted by  Senator Greenwood  ‘s reference to the previous Prime Minister to recall that about 3 months before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> I asked a question about  Mr McMahon  conferring with  Mr Heath. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Except in the very exceptional case to solve deadlocks after an <span class="highlight">election</span> in section 57, the Senate and House of Representatives operate separately in their constitutional functions of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731122_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Corio in the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in 1940 and he became Minister for War Organisation of Industry in 1941, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction in 1945 and Minister for Defence in 1946. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the following question: Owing to the utter confusion in relation to the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee <span class="highlight">election</span> last Saturday and in view of the lack of training of Aboriginal enrollers and co-ordinators and the limited time allocated for the setting up of the necessary mechanics, will the Government accept the responsibility for the outcome rather than passing the blame on to the employed Aborigines? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are very proud to accept the responsibility for the <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was well conducted and in which there was great interest in most areas, shown by the numbers of Aborigines who voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the notice paper we see the Bills of a fundamental character which the Government has seen fit to introduce in terms of its interpretation of the mandate given to it at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731127_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth of the story is that they have not realised even yet that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held on 2 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition senators have convenient memories, because 2 December when the people were asked to vote at an <span class="highlight">election</span> was not so long ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian newspapers, which traditionally have been anti-Labor for a long period of years, were advocating on their pages a change in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Big business which also has been traditionally anti-Labor and which has financed the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns of Liberal-Country Party governments for a long period of years was also advocating that it was time for a change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the hallmark of a Government that has shown initiative and sincerity in purpose, a Government that has shown a keen desire to honour the pledges that it gave when it was campaigning for the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard  Senator Maunsell  from Queensland criticising this Government for implementing its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was said earlier, by interjection, that the Australian Labor Party and the Prime Minister did not keep an <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge regarding education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at the speeches that  Senator Little  made when he was seeking <span class="highlight">election</span>, they will see that he hammered this idea of recognition of the deployment of people away from the big cities, including Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  made it quite clear that we would take action in this area if we were elected to government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731128_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Would the Minister for the Media have an investigation made into the reasons why radio and television stations, including those of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, gave wide publicity on the night of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> to reports that according to their computer calculations there was a 10 per cent to 11 per cent swing against the Australian Labor Party and that it would lose up to 9 seats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister seen the latest results which show that the Australian Labor Party will be returned with the same number of seats as it held prior to the elections despite the cynical gerrymander of New South Wales electorates by the Askin Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator DOUGLAS McCLELLANDFirstly, I am aware that the Labor Party in New South Wales will be returned, as I understand it, with the same number of seats in the new Parliament as it had in the previous Parliament as a result of  Mr Don  Day being returned as the State member for Casino at the <span class="highlight">election</span> that was held on 1 7 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the reason for the slowness of the receipt of the figures by comparison with the rate of receipt at Federal elections is that for Federal elections full-time electoral officers are engaged in counting the votes whereas for the New South Wales State elections part-time electoral officers are engaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we hear a lot of this sort of thing from a government which is reputed to have hired a multi-national public relations business situated in New York to conduct the advertising for its last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear a lot of nonsense about what won the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Labor Party, how it was swept in and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If both Houses of the Parliament went to an <span class="highlight">election</span> I think it could be a very interesting <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, because under the education policies of this Government certain schools are not being provided with assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labor Party would like a double dissolution on this issue I think a very interesting <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign would ensue in relation to the discrimination between one church school as opposed to others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed it should be listed that prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the now Prime Minister asserted that within the existing Constitution his government could govern effectively and with completeness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as the Prime Minister said in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech: ‘We cannot expect to clear away that backlog in three months or even three years. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government decided that the cheapest way of honouring the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Prime Minister was for it to work through such legal aid services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind him also that at no time did he or any other Labor spokesman on primary industry indicate in their <span class="highlight">election</span> policies a hardening in policies in regard to wheat producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the importance of ascertaining and publishing the true facts for proper assessment by the Parliament and by the Australian people, will the Federal Government produce as a matter of some urgency a White Paper or a considered statement in particular, clarifying the repeated allegations that the Allende Government in the latter part of its period of office had abandoned democratic processes, the basis of its <span class="highlight">election</span>, and was imposing dictatorial and totalitarian methods upon the Chilean people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731129_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-61-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no need for a constitutional referendum to ensure that simultaneous elections are held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, we can have simultaneous elections at any time that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  likes to go and see the Governor-General because in section 57 of the Constitution there is provision for a double dissolution if there is a disagreement between the 2 Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A double dissolution would bring about simultaneous elections of the whole of this chamber and of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But,  Mr President,  it is not even necessary to hold a double dissolution to bring the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives back to the same date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could, if it wished to do so and if it had the courage to do so, take out the House of Representatives at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- that is, when those honourable senators who are due to retire at 30 June 1974 have to face their electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This Bill has as its objective the coordination of elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that it is possible for the Government to co-ordinate the <span class="highlight">election</span> of both houses without a referendum and without constitutional change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What more ideal moment could there be than the present moment when the Government states that it is being obstructed by the Senate, when the Government has announced that if the Senate attempts to make the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  carry out his promise to preserve basic grants for all schools the Government will deprive the children of Australia of hundreds of thousands of dollars of educational aid and when the Government says that it believes that this issue is so vital that it wants to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What more ideal moment than the present to co-ordinate the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the 2 Houses by a double dissolution and an <span class="highlight">election</span> within the next two or three weeks? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead it proposes to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on an <span class="highlight">election</span> and on a referendum when there is no real need for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could have been an <span class="highlight">election</span> if we had defeated the Appropriation Bill only last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Prime Minister seriously ask the people of Australia to believe that cost saving is one reason why his Government wants to hold Senate and House of Representatives elections at the same time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that Labor has a warped sense of proportion and priority where expense is concerned, but a Government which contributes heavily and unashamedly to the rate of inflation through the totality of its own expenditure is most unlikely seriously to consider austerity in the form of reduced <span class="highlight">election</span> costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today  Mr Heath, Mr Whitlam  and  Mr Trudeau  are sniffing the wind not for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is an issue worthy of an <span class="highlight">election</span> but for the purpose of ascertaining whether the breeze is blowing favourably and whether it would be propitious to go to the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence  Mr Whitlam  ‘s nervousness and, in a sense, hesitation in the aura of the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irrespective of whether he had another 3 months or 2 years of his 3-year term to run he would, if he thought it was favourable for party political purposes to do so, force an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an era in which such a system has been developed it is doubly important to maintain the importance of a fixed term of <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House which has to oppose a government which has a majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we should fall victim to the myopia that seems to be clouding the outlook of the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and vote for a Bill that is designed to make the Senate the echo of a government party on the hustings every time an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held for the House of Representatives, it would mean, I think, that we would be doing less than our duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Half of the Senate is to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were a Party of a government that might very well create in Caucus tomorrow morning such a situation that there would be an <span class="highlight">election</span> which would take the other House to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have before us now this proposal dealing with simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator McManus  has pointed out so clearly, if bringing the elections of this Parliament into gear is the desideratum of those who are concerned about the expenditure of $2m in order to consult the people in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Senate, is that mere waste or gross extravagance in relation to the purchase of ‘Blue Poles’- blue, black or brindle; I do not care what it is called- which is a bit of duco stuck on canvass and for which the agent’s fee was $100,000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity faces the Government now, if it has the courage to go to the country and so bring the elections for the Houses together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it wants to avoid a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> because that will cost $2m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out, the need for the synchronisation of elections has not been brought about by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think it is a very good move at all to change the Constitution to enable this place to be taken to an <span class="highlight">election</span> every time the House of Representatives decides to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite possible that in the other place situations may develop from time to time which may bring about more elections than are being held now because of the elections for the Houses being out of tune with each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the Senate’s point of view, having a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> apart from the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> focusses attention on the Senate much more than when the 2 Houses go to the polls together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government, through the Prime Minister, before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> put in the policy statement to the people: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, the people are entitled to voice their opinion on the question whether there should be synchronisation of elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult enough to alter it now, but when the House of Representatives proposes an alteration which was previously put to the people at <span class="highlight">election</span>, one would think that in all decency it ought to be put to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are too many elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elections of the House of Representatives and the Senate ought to be synchronised conveniently, either by this method or by having some fixed term for both Housesfor example, a 6-year term for the Senate, as it is, and a 3-year term for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it appeared to the Government that the convenient way of synchronising elections of the 2 Houses was to alter the Constitution so that when there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives there was one for the Senate also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are not prepared to say: ‘Here is a proposal that was put to the people by the Prime Minister at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are prepared to accept the verdict of the people at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead, we will have the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that if the Opposition votes for the amendment or votes against putting the matter to the people it is denying the people the right to say whether the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives should be synchronised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the present proposal had applied at the time of the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span>, one vote in the electorate of Sydney would have been worth 1.7 votes in the electorate of Robertson, and one vote in the electorate of Melbourne would have been worth 1.77 votes in the electorate of Diamond Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This issue was raised prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But he laughed at them and said that the sort of political advertising that he had seen in the Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> was cream puff advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘I would be sorry to see British elections conducted on these lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members of the Australian Labor Party really believed in the principle of one vote one value they would advocate the system of <span class="highlight">election</span> which gives the nearest approximation to the principle of one vote one value, that is, the HareClark system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a recent address to the Proportional Representation Society in South Australia,  Mr Clyde  Cameron said that in his opinion the only system of <span class="highlight">election</span> which could be calculated to give electoral justice to all parties was the Hare-Clark proportional representation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The committee sat down and produced an excellent report which indicated that the fairest system of <span class="highlight">election</span> and the system which gave the nearest thing to electoral justice was the Hare-Clark proportional representation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just before 2 December- in the week before 2 December- there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were various contentions as to what effect it would have on the subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While I was in New Zealand I got hold of some Press cuttings on the <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that in New Zealand elections are assessed on a population basis and that New Zealand is pretty meticulous in this respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy speech, which was presented by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  immediately before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 December 1972, expressed a determination to make local government a genuine partner in the Federal system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731204_senate_28_s58/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister for Social Security in this place, that we backdated pension increases to the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy speech of the Australian Labor Party delivered by the Prime Minister during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign stated that we would establish a Schools Commission along the same lines as the Universities Commission and the Advanced Education Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the Prime Minister was saying that this is one of the principal matters, if not the principal matter, in our <span class="highlight">election</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an increase recommended by the Karmel Committee which was set up by the new Government shortly after its <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Schedule will have the effect of dishonouring a solemn promise given by the Government on many occasions in the period leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year and reaffirmed by it on a number of occasions since it became the Government in what I think would be regarded by anyone as the clearest terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were made by the Government prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>- made by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made a show of saying that he was going to be at certain places on 23 November and other places on 24 November, before the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement, which was headed ‘Go Forward with Grassby’, he had a message. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just before the <span class="highlight">election</span> Al Grassby said that he and his colleagues were ‘pledged to that new deal which will immediately give another IS per cent on top of existing grants and aids.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a letter to  Mr J.  Dixon,  Chairman  of the National Council of Independent Schools, written by  Mr Whitlam  as Prime Minister after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That letter is a direct repudiation of the promises made repeatedly by the Labor Party prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this day it remains not prepared to honor the obligations which it assumed when it made the promises before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, and not prepared to honour the obligations which it assumed when, as a government, it repeated them after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one aspect to which I wish to return and that is if, in direct repudiation of the promises made many times by all those people to whom I have referred and many more, this Government intends to pursue this matter to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, it will find itself having to face a situation in which the matter on which it has refused to act- a request by the Senate- is a matter on which it has refused to honour the promises made not once, not twice but many times before and after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the parents of those 53 children who attend this small school in a suburb of Melbourne were promised by a very eminent member of the Labor Party Cabinet just before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that if they voted Labor they would get much more money- they were told they would get nearly double- the school has been placed in category A and gets nothing because of the absurdity of the basis upon which the categorisation takes place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should lay to rest for all time the accusation which has come from the other side of the chamber that there has been a repudiation of an undertaking given by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A motion was moved in the House of Representatives on 26 September of last year, which was about 2 months before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, in these terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So on 26 September 1972, 2 months before the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in which the Australian Labor Party was elected to office, a motion was passed in those terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How, in the face of that, could the Prime Minister get up on the hustings during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and make some other statement which would be contrary to the provisions of the amendment moved in the House of Representatives last year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard  Senator Rae  quoting the exact words which were not only said by the Minister but also were printed and distributed in a number of private schools before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Beazley,  within 5 weeks of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, as the prospective Minister for Education, said that the Labor Government would continue the basic per capita payments to all schools as at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the nonsense which has been manufactured by the Government to provide what it believes will be a good <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we have said is that when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education promise people before an <span class="highlight">election</span> that they will continue to give at least basic aid to all schools, they should keep their promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be our policy, and before the <span class="highlight">election</span> it was the policy of the Whitlam Labor Party which made it its policy at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking them to do now what they told the people of this country, when they were trying to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>, that they would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This article also states that there is nothing in Labor’s policy speech for the last <span class="highlight">election</span> to indicate that grants are to be withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paid propagandists have been put to work to manufacture this into an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This promise was made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we ask of the Government is this: Having made a promise before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and received thousands of votes because of that promise, it should keep its promise and give to the small number of A class schools that are left the basic per capita grants which  Mr Whitlam  and  Mr Beazley  pledged themselves as honourable men to give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-53-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has been so evident that  Senator McManus  began his contribution to the debate by saying that the issue now before the Senate had developed into an issue of the credibility of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education to honour their pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises in regard to education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both  Senator Devitt  and  Senator James  McClelland went to great lengths to try to show the people of Australia that the Government was carrying out its repeated pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises that any form of education benefit already existing would be maintained and, therefore, any aid would be additional to that existing in the field of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign his campaign director, I take it, put in the newspapers  Mr Grassby  ‘s itinerary for 23 and 24 November last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the States Grants (Schools) Bill which, if and when enacted, will enable us as a Government to provide to the people of this country the funds that are required to carry out the principal <span class="highlight">election</span> platform of the Labor Party which was to make education the prime responsibility of a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that in addition to the novelty, if I might use  Senator Rae  ‘s expression, of the Bill appropriating the largest amount ever expended by a government on education, which is what this Government is doing, there is wrapped up in the whole of this legislation the element of the principle of needs which was urged by the Labor Party not only at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> but also at a time when we were in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole basis of our <span class="highlight">election</span> policy was wrapped up in those 2 paragraphs and is embodied in this legislation that we are now seeking to have passed through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot has been said about what the Prime Minister had to say in the middle of last year- 6 months before the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact it was debated in this chamber a mere 12 days before this House rose for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That was on 19 October 1972-12 days before this Parliament rose for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is now proposing that all schools, and in particular the category A schools, be guaranteed during 1974 and 1975 recurrent grants at per capita rates of $62 for primary schools and $104 for secondary schools; that is, the rates that have applied this year- 1973- in accordance with our policy as enunicated at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that ‘a Federal Labor Government will continue all grants under Commonwealth legislation throughout 1973’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s commitments are those that I mentioned earlier, namely, the statements made during the debate on the 1972 legislation and in the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what we, as a Senate, can do is to say that certainly if the people of Australia were made a solemn promise before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> they are entitled to have this chamber keep the Government honest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me to refer to one more promise in case there is any doubt that just before the <span class="highlight">election</span> the present Government had a change of heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a letter which was written just before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot support it because, for a start, it is opposed completely to the political ideology of the Government, the espoused policy of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Labor Party at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, and the manner in which the Karmel Committee reported to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, then in Opposition, 6 weeks before the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, moved that at the end of the motion ‘That the Bill be now read a second time ‘ the following words be added: but the Senate, while not refusing a second reading to the Bill, is ofthe opinion that it should provide for the establishment of an Australian Schools Commission to examine and determine the needs of students in government and non-government primary, secondary and technical schools, and recommend grants which the Commonwealth should make to the States to assist in meeting the requirements of all school age children on the basis of needs and priorities- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That happened 12 days before this House rose and 6 weeks before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We say that our policy was put in precise terms to the people at the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rae  has quoted several times tonight the repeated statements which were made during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that no grants for nongovernment schools would be reduced by the Labor Government if it came to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All we ask is that the Government carry out the promise made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for Education,  Mr Beazley,  before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, namely, that if the Labor Party were elected to office it would at least maintain the basic per capita grants given to every school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government says to us that it will fight an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue, I tell it that we will welcome an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue of whether the promises that the Government made when it wanted votes to win an <span class="highlight">election</span> can be believed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also tell the Government that if it fights an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this issue,  Mr Whitlam  will not be Prime Minister when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not believe that the Australian electorate will accept a situation in which, for the sake of $8m, this Government says that it is prepared if necessary to plunge the country into an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will fight that <span class="highlight">election</span> on the question of whether in future the word of the Prime Minister can be accepted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to do the honourable thing, when this amendment goes to the House of Representatives the Government will say that it will continue the present system, at least until there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the people can decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party is not deterred by the suggestion that we may lose in our numbers as a result of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government, which purports to represent the less affluent members of our society, has chosen to dishonour a promise made before and since the <span class="highlight">election</span> with regard to persistent per capita grants for this type of school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are adamant that the Labor Party should honour its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> and post-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises that no student in Australia will be disadvantaged as a result of its education policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second basis upon which the Opposition’s amendment rests is-that the Government is running away from-a promise which it made prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> and upon which many people would have believed that the Labor Party’s conduct in Government would be different from what it has turned out to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were statements made by  Mr Beazley  and letters written to numerous people before and after the <span class="highlight">election</span> indicating his attitude. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam himself after the <span class="highlight">election</span> wrote to the  Chairman  of the National Council of Independent Schools on 13 December 1972, the day on which he appointed the Karmel Committee, and his words are instructive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constant attitude of the Australian Labor Party in the period leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of last year and in the months immediately after it cannot be challenged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a principle on which we are prepared to challenge the Government to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>, if the Government wants to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we run the risk that if we take a particular course of action it may involve the whole Senate in being put before the people at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a voice which was submerged and subdued in the period leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> because  Mr Whitlam  wanted to have his way and to present his case and  Mr Beazley  wanted to have his way and to present his case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But after the <span class="highlight">election</span> the forces demonstrated their power and, of course,  Mr Beazley  was overridden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So strong was their criticism when poor  Mr Holding  attempted to say at the State <span class="highlight">election</span> before last that he favoured a reasonable quantum of State aid he was disciplined by Hartley and Crawford and the rug was pulled out from under him, and of course he had no prospect whatever of forming a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because  Mr Whitlam  told him before the <span class="highlight">election</span>: ‘You can tell the brandy characters that under Labor this impost will go ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so that I cannot be accused of further deception I now seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the schools policy of the Labor Party at the 1972 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> as enunciated by the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I reiterate that the policy of the Labor Government was put in precise terms to the people at the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have marked this statutory declaration in various places which gives the he to the point that was made in this Senate 2 days before the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would now like to refer again to what I said earlier about  Senator Webster  using this forum here tonight as a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He listened avidly a fortnight ago to the expression of  Senator Gietzelt  ‘s malice in taking the occasion the night before the <span class="highlight">election</span> to make, under the privilege of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the 2 increases of $1.50 a week that the Government has already made to pensions- incidentally, the first one was backdated to February from the first pension payment date after the holding of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December of last year- I would think that the figures cited by  Senator Cameron  are correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister feel that if this is a wise and correct procedure action should be taken to lift the prohibition now placed on the broadcasting of <span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda after 48 hours prior to polling day thus bringing the broadcasting and television media into line with newspapers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legal advice given to me is that referendum broadcasting material does not come within the definition of <span class="highlight">election</span> matter presently appearing in the Broadcasting and Television Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was said by  Mr Kim  E. Beazley, Minister for Education, in a letter dated 8 February 1973- long after the <span class="highlight">election</span> and long after the promises that were made last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be a double dissolution on this issue and an <span class="highlight">election</span> fought on it the people of Australia will have the opportunity of hearing the truth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to say again, as I have said before, that the Government has not been honest in meeting the <span class="highlight">election</span> undertakings it has given. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the debate yesterday on the States Grants (Schools) Bill reference was made to the per capita grants which were promised prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> and after the <span class="highlight">election</span> and which have not been forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>  Mr Dunstan,  as  Chairman  of the Australian Labor Party’s Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> Finance Committee, was authorised to make certain promises to wine makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek your financial support for the ALP Campaign for the federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Federal Labor Government will save you these costs in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Laucke  also asked whether the withdrawal of the concessional basis of valuation of end of year wine stocks directly contradicts undertakings given by the Government before the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year not to replace the wine excise by sales tax or any other impost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator’s interpretation of the <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking implies that he considers that the unjustifiably privileged taxation status of the wine makers is inviolate and should be preserved at all costs and for all time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#debate-67">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his <span class="highlight">Election</span> Policy Speech of 13 November 1972, the Prime Minister undertook the National Superannuation would be established in Australia after a thorough enquiry into overseas examples and Australian proposals for such a scheme and he indicated that a Committee would be appointed to recommend a scheme of National Superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731206_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-75-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Minster agree that voters should not be tormented or their attention distracted by the introduction of spurious referendums at either a Senate or House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was part of the Australian Labor Party’s POliCy before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, amendments to similar effect had been moved by the Government when in Opposition, and the Government’s employees were fully aware of and justifiably expected the original proposals to be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this is a negation of the popular mandate that was given to the Australian Labor Party at the <span class="highlight">election</span> a year ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the last 23 years the parties which formed the previous Government made great play after each general <span class="highlight">election</span> of the fact that they had received a clear mandate to carry out any proposal included in their policy statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet we are now faced with a situation in which they defiantly reject significant pieces of the Government’s legislative program which were spelt out in the Government’s pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> policy statement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went on to say:  a Senate opposition whose party had just been completely defeated at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, would be in command of the Government of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I put it to honourable senators that in our policy speech and in the speech of the GovernorGeneral at the opening of the Parliament there were laid down the fundamental cornerstones of the Labor Party program which was placed before the electors at the 1972 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our local government system has grown up over a very long period, and the people will not take too kindly to not having any say in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the people who tax them for ordinary city development purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts in the previous government,  Mr Howson,  saying that the fact that he lost his seat at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> was due very much to the organisation of the Lake Pedder action group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he make inquiries, and advise the Senate when the information is available, as to whether it is true, as indicated in the Launceston ‘Examiner’ of Monday, 19 November, that the Prime Minister travelled, presumably by Royal Australian Air Force V.I.P aircraft, on Saturday, 17 November, from Adelaide to Sydney to record his vote at the State <span class="highlight">election</span> and continued to Launceston, arriving one hour late for his appointment at an agricultural show? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the date of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced I had accepted many invitations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced for 1 7 November I arranged to travel that day from Adelaide to Sydney and thence to Launceston. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like most honourable members I regard it as my obligation to vote in person and to visit polling places at elections in my own electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-57-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> within the next 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I, as the representative of the Government, need to say is that my colleagues join me in appreciating that the Australian people will now not be deprived of the Australian Schools Commission which, prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Labor movement undertook to establish if and when we were elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things which we have to remember is that the Australian Labor Party promised that it would do something about overcrowded cities, and the <span class="highlight">election</span> was won in the outer areas of Sydney and Melbourne, where people were quite concerned about the position and voted accordingly so that they could get something done about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that, there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1969 when the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  campaigned throughout this country that the socalled national health scheme was not good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He gained a tremendous number of seats in that <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in December of last year he attained the Prime Ministership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result the Parliament was deadlocked 86 votes to 86 votes and this forced a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the suggestion made by  Mr Snedden,  the Leader of the Liberal Party in the other House, who said that we would welcome a double dissolution and an <span class="highlight">election</span> fought on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say, firstly, that in fulfilment of the Labor Party’s undertaking given by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives, and was introduced into the Senate last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At page 10 of the Australian Labor Party’s policy speech, as delivered by the Prime Minister at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Whitlam  had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in fulfilment of a clear mandate given by the people to the Labor movement on 2 December 1972, after these issues had been hotly debated during the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that this legislation, having been introduced by way of public discussion - (Opposition senators interjecting)- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party went to the people at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> with the clear policy that it would, if elected to office, establish a National Health Insurance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor movement was in opposition in this Parliament last year we made our position quite clear both when the then Government’s State Grants (Schools) Bill 1972 was debated in the Senate on 19 October of last year and again in  Mr Whitlam’s  <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are elected to government as soon as the present Government is prepared to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which it is showing a marked reluctance to do- it is making big noises but taking little action- we will immediately re-introduce the base per capita grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Labor Party had spoken of the proposed Corporation having its grower representation elected by the growers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that in the next year we might all get along together, at least until the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> or the double dissolution approaches when the people once more will have their say as to which of us will return here and which of us will not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-83-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I thank the Senate for the honour conferred on me by my <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators would wish me, I hope, on the occasion of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a new  Chairman  of Committees to make some observations on the retirement of  Senator Prowse,  who resigned his place as a senator on 3 1 December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had a close association which became closer on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to this place where the two of us for nearly 12 years represented Western Australia as the 2 Country Party senators from that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- On behalf of the Liberal senators in this place I congratulate  Senator Webster  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I cannot wish him a long tenure of office because that would mean that after June 30 my own colleague  Senator Little  would be eliminated, there being an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held in May, as most of us know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a fellow Queenslander, as one who campaigned with him in his first <span class="highlight">election</span> and as one who had a very high regard for him personally and as a member of the House of Representatives, on behalf of the Liberal senators I join with the Leader of the Government in expressing very sincere sympathy to Donald Cameron’s wife and his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British Labour Party at a dinner to Khruschev protested so strongly at the denial of human rights in the Soviet implemented by the KGB that Khruschev said that if he had a vote in a British <span class="highlight">election</span> he would vote Conservative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It follows from the policies that were established by the Labor Party before it was elected on 2 December of last year and which it has carried out since its <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For that reason, despite many years of opposition by the conservative parties in Australia, one of the first actions which we took upon <span class="highlight">election</span> was to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But it is a most remarkable achievement that Israel, in the height of the present serious troubles in which it finds itself, was able to hold free democratic elections, or at least as free and democratic as any elections can be; that all parties were able to contest that <span class="highlight">election</span> and that the group from the Israeli Communist Party which is very largely sympathetic with the Arabs won 4 seats in the Israeli Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And even in South Australia, where he holds 7 out of 12 seats, he lost a seat in the 1972 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That will be the policy that the Government will be taking to the people at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister’s plethora of referenda, which we are told will be put to the people on the same day as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, contains a few more barbs aimed in this direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> honourable senators opposite- not all of them- were going to make a great deal about racism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Its supporters know of the approaching Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and one argument they propose to use is that the Senate is obstructing the legislation of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the past week the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has said in Tasmania and Victoria that one of the objects of the Government in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> must be to destroy the small parties, and in particular the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he will not be able to get control of the Senate in the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is typical phoney propaganda for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to come now to what will be, after all, the main issue of this Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read recently in propaganda about the British <span class="highlight">election</span> that  Mr Wilson  declared publicly on the platform and through the media that  Mr Heath  must be removed as Prime Minister of Britain because food and clothing prices had gone up by 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that one is to ensure democratic elections in the House of Representatives, but the Government presumes to alter the Constitution to provide the rules for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the State Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that there was no need to pass the matter by referendum or to alter the Constitution because  Mr Whitlam  has every right to go to the people now to have a double dissolution, and then he could synchronise the elections for the two Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is all very well for this next <span class="highlight">election</span>, but it would not necessarily synchronise any other elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Liberal Party well knows, when it suited it it disregarded the tie between the elections for the 2 Houses and changed the times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The transfer of power involved is a transfer of power to the people- that there will be democratic elections for each of the Houses of Parliament of the States, that there will be a democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives, that there will not be the possibility of gerrymander, that the oversight - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of this country wants to put this measure to the people at the time of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is desirable in the public interest that it be put to the people at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that if these tactics were to succeed it would mean there would have to be some referendum separate from the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, which would cost the people almost $3m extra and cause great public inconvenience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  has made clear that the Opposition rejects the Bill, that it rejects the whole concept of democratic elections by the people for the House of Representatives and for the upper and lower Houses in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the provisions of section 128 of the Constitution in respect of Constitution Alteration Bills passed in one House- in this instance, the House of Representatives- by an absolute majority on 2 occasions and which already have been rejected, have failed to pass or have been unacceptably amended in the Senate, the Government re-introduces the Constitution Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill in the Senate so that it can proceed towards a referendum on the matter, a referendum that the Government intends be held concurrently with the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 commend to the Senate the Constitution Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side are not saying that this Constitution Alteration (Democratic Elections) Bill ought to be delayed indefinitely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister is talking about running to a timetable in order to have a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> some time in May, coupled with a referendum, he ought to be able to meet the date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that the Government is doing is endeavouring to enable the people of Australia at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to have a say also on whether they want to alter their own Constitution to provide for democratic elections to be overseen in the ultimate by the High Court of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us send it off to a committee or do some trickery or use some device so that we can prevent the people having their say on these constitutional questions at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are going to send it off to a committee for examination or adjourn further debate on it in order to fracture the timetable which has to be met if this matter is to be put to the people at the time of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the arguments which have been advanced in the debate on the first Constitution Alteration Bill today, I appreciate that a great deal of point taking is being engaged in prior to a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some reason the Government is determined to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 4, 1 1 or 1 8 May, or so we are led to believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should not the Government be prepared to allow the Senate time for consideration and the presentation of its argument for public consumption, and have the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time before 29 June? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has to be time after the <span class="highlight">election</span> and before 30 June to enable votes to be counted and matters to be sorted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us see what Opposition senators can think up and let us hear their rationalisations as they justify their endeavours to prevent the matter being put to the people at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, which is the most convenient and most inexpensive way of allowing the people of Australia to execise their democratic rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why the public has supported us and has sent us here in growing numbers after each successive <span class="highlight">election</span> to carry out that particular task. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government was not too sure that it would help its chances in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what are members of the Opposition doing in this Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> year when we have been promised or threatened with a heavy concentration of legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us have a straightout Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to put it to the people at the time of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that promise was given during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relevant Bills were passed by the chamber which the people elected at that <span class="highlight">election</span> but were thrown out by this chamber in a contemptuous fashion on 4 December without even being given an second reading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation will soon be corrected at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the period of 14 months or so that we have been in government, they have allowed certain measures through, but any legislation which was of importance or which affected their policies has been rejected, notwithstanding that the Government had a mandate for its action as it had put these matters to the people at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wishes to save the expense of a separate referendum and for many reasons it is convenient to have it held concurrently with the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the Government will not tell us when the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that under the Constitution the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> can be held as late as Saturday, 29 June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government would take us into its confidence by saying ‘We have been advised by our advisers that the last possible date on which the <span class="highlight">election</span> can be held is such and such because of various reasons’, we could test the reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government would take us into its confidence by saying ‘We have certain printing problems; we have certain problems in relation to time for the preparation for the <span class="highlight">election</span>’ - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will announce the <span class="highlight">election</span> date at the latest possible time in order to try to catch us by surprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all that, we have now reached the stage that we do not even know when the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely those honourable senators who are coming up for re-<span class="highlight">election</span> should know when this <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can recall the Leader of the then Opposition saying in this place that the Government should indicate to the people of Australia when there would be a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been the practice in the past to hold a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of the year before the year in which the 6-year term of an honourable senator expires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet no one has been told when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy  has pleaded most eloquently for action to be taken so that the Government can put its referundum proposals to the people on the day of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for well informed people like  Senator McAuliffe, Senator Mulvihill  and others to be quite happy about this matter but how am I, when so frequently I am not even informed of these matters of high public moment, to know how to vote or of the way in which we should act in order to fall in with  Senator Murphy’s  requirements as to time when he knows the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and I do not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have to get things to fit in just right for the date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have been interested to see in the Press that at least 2 branches of the Australian Labor Party have implored  Mr Whitlam  not to have the referenda on the day of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should not say this from the point of view of tactics: But if I were in the Australian Labor Party I would not complicate the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> by holding referenda with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot imagine how a leader can ask his Party to go to a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and complicate the position at the same time with a number of measures which can be interpreted as an attack upon the Senate as a States House, an attack upon State rights and an attempt to interfere with the electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at least I am entitled to say that I agree with some of the most knowledgeable members in your Party who were put on a pedestal for their assistance in winning the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the people who do not want  Mr Whitlam  to complicate the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I learned a lot and I can only say to the members of the Australian Labor Party, as I have said before: If you hold this referendum on the same day as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> it will blow up in your faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the Government to achieve its purposethat is, to present this matter to the people for decision sometime in May or June, whenever the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is held- there must be an initial presentation to both Houses and a rejection by the second House and subsequently, after an interval of 3 months, a further presentation of the Bill to both Houses of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were violently opposed to the 2 elections being brought together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they want to adopt one policy for an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives and another policy for an <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate, or do they want an elected government to be supervised by a Senate, or half of a Senate, that was elected 3 years earlier, not on the issues that were current at the time the Government was elected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the Opposition Parties do not want the elections brought together because it does not advantage them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not advantage them to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the basis of a national policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we have the elections divided they can say anything they like because when they are asking for senators to be elected they know that they have no responsibility for government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After 30 June we will hear again the wise words that we heard after a previous Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> when  Senator Cole  announced that he would be the leader of the Democratic Labor Party,  Senator McManus  would be the  Deputy  Leader, and the Whip was yet to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussions some people in the Liberal Party have talked about double dissolutions to bring the 2 elections together again and all these sorts of things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Government could at any time bring the elections together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is due it could decide at that time to dissolve the House of Representatives and take half the Senate out with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I personally am not satisfied, and the media will not convince me, that the Labor Party could not win a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> if it went out on the hustings tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see any reason why the Constitution should not be amended to bring the 2 Houses into line and for half the Senate to retire at the time of each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continuity of the Senate would be destroyed because, every time there is a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, 30 senators would go out of office for about 3 months while an <span class="highlight">election</span> took place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate loses 30 senators for 3 months every time there is a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Senate’s committee activity could not continue during that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is desired to bring the elections for the 2 Houses together, a simple solution is for the House of Representatives to shorten its own term and go to the polls at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, due to be held before 30 June 1974.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government proposes to intrude into that <span class="highlight">election</span> a proposal for a constitutional alteration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could hold the <span class="highlight">election</span> consequent upon that double dissolution at the time that it is proposed to hold the <span class="highlight">election</span> for half of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has the power to bring about simultaneous elections now, and it wants to put the people to the expense and trouble of a referendum in order to get the power to do something that it already has the power to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Cant  said that if the House of Representatives and Senate elections were held simultaneously it would probably get rid of the Democratic Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Democratic Labor Party will face up to elections, whether they are for both Houses or for one House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is not game to go to a double dissolution because if a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> were held in 6 weeks or 2 months time the Government would be out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is hard to find anybody who is prepared to admit that he voted Labor at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does  Senator McManus  seriously suggest that the federal structure will be weakened if we have simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When you have a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at a different time to a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> takes on the character of a by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is notorious that, no matter what government is in office, whether a Labor government or a LiberalCountry Party coalition government propped up by the Democratic Labor Party, when there is a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives the people take the opportunity to be critical of whatever government is in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can examine the records with which we have been supplied by the psephologists which show that there is no exception to this rule that when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held separately to a general <span class="highlight">election</span> the electors take the opportunity to give the government of the day a rap over the knuckles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a vote cast in the atmosphere of a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> is not a vote which is cast as sensibly as one with which the people elect a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the bonuses that we will get out of the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> will be that we will be relieved of the presence of  Senator Little  in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yes, but the senator’s term is reduced independently of his <span class="highlight">election</span> and independently of what ever period for which the people may have elected him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in 1 95 1 , so my term of office was 5 years of a normal 6-year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I contested other elections in 1953, 1958, 1964 and 1970, so I have contested 6 elections and my term of office should have lasted for 36 years but that period has been reduced to 27 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was pointed out to  Senator Lawrie  earlier, the Opposition is afraid to let the Government go through the democratic process of asking the people to decide upon these matters at a time when it is most economical to do so, namely, at the time of a general <span class="highlight">election</span> or the equivalent of a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Along with  Senator Wright,  1 have been a member of this chamber since 1949, and I am sure that  Senator Wright  would agree with me when I say that over the years when the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives were held at the same time the Senate was considered in a minor key. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only when the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives have been held at different times has the Senate come much more into the public mind at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister came from the House of Representatives and the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy was focused very sharply on the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the change from the pattern of holding elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives at the same time, with the actions that have been taken and the development that has occurred in the Senate over some years now, and despite what the Australian National Opinion Poll and others might say, in the minds of thinking people in this country the Senate rates higher now than at any time in its history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Her  Majesty realised that most of the things contained in that Speech which she made to this Parliament were also contained in the Prime Minister’s policy speech to this nation at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>- a policy speech which was accepted by a majority of the Queen’s Australian subjects on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although we are taunted by the Democratic Labor Party senators and  Senator Withers  who say that the Prime Minister ought to make the short trip to Government House and call for a double dissolution, they know in their own hearts who will win if the facts have to be put before the people at an <span class="highlight">election</span> and if the Prime Minister goes on the hustings and on television in opposition to the Liberal Leader,  Mr Snedden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am hopeful that after the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> people in this chamber will no longer be able to say: ‘You do not have a mandate for it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Shortly after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> great play was made of this when the Party said: Yes, we are quite happy to follow the policy of the Australian Labor Party in electing a shadow Cabinet or a Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be proven in South Australia at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> when each of the candidates from the Opposition parties are shown on separate Senate tickets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we look back through the history in regard to pension increases we find that the only time the poor old pensioner received any decent pension increases of a little more than 50c- I think that the highest increase was $1.25- was during an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government proposes that this Bill, along with several other proposals for constitutional amendments already submitted to this Parliament, will be put to the people by referendum at the time of the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Senate will pass it speedily, so that it can be submitted to the people at the time of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that not only is nothing precipitate ever going to be done but, as far as the Opposition is concerned, if it can help it nothing will be done by the Senate to assist the Government in its program of putting to the people at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> certain proposals for altering the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure how much of the debates of the Convention and other matters have been presented to the Parliament, but I know that Opposition senators are determined to see to it that the announced program of the Government to put the proposals for an alteration to the Constitution to the people for their decision at the time of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is spragged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One cannot do anything about it until after the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A Prime Minister who seeks to remove from this country all the signs of monarchy- the anthem, the flag and the insignia of the monarchynevertheless sees in it in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year a charisma which will help his purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a mid-term Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> serves any purpose- and it does; it serves a very valuable purpose- it serves the purpose of judging the government of the day on what it has done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing was done- except that we have been given some belated promise now because there is to be a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- to adjust the tax schedules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party, in its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> campaign stated to local government bodies: ‘Put us in and we will give you full and equal status with State and Federal government, full and equal rights to go to the Loan Council and to go to the Grants Commission’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that I do not mean the disaster of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government; I mean the disaster of the floods in Queensland and northern New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He recognised before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that there had been a breakdown in the economic viability of many rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today we had an interesting debate on simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make this point quite clear: It is thoroughly understandable why the Labor Party, against the views of the founding fathers and against the views of those with long sight, wishes to bring together the elections for the 2 Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in retrospect this situation had applied and had existed today, there would be no Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 2 months time and no chance for the Australian people to judge this Government in mid-term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the people of Australia will see at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> that we have their interests at heart. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I looked at what had happened since this Government came to power I found that some of the promises which it made during electioneering certainly had not been carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find that the Government certainly has not carried out its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in that field or, as I mentioned earlier, in the field of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives were held now the figures would show a majority of 30 to 40 in favour of the Liberal and Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in Labor Party policy but it was not put forward in the December 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two years before the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Prime Minister in a telecast made it plain that his Government when in office would not have an immigration policy that would benefit Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Majesty’s gracious Speech as one which sets the pattern for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that be true then I say that a mid-term parliamentary Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is a good thing because it will provide the people with the opportunity to make a judgment and to give an adequate response to the Government’s program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is interesting to note that the main <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and the ones which the public took notice of are the very ones that honourable senators opposite have not implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard that one of the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises was to reduce interest rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place- in May, we hope; we do not know when it will be held; some of us will be told at some time- we will know then who has the mandate, whether the Government has a mandate to continue or whether the Senate has a mandate to throw it out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no mention of that in the preelection policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the people of this country will consider these proposed constitutional alterations, which we understand will be presented at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and give them the same kind of treatment as was meted out to the prices and incomes referenda last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another great <span class="highlight">election</span> promise was that Labor would do something abour rural industries and make sure that it looked after the labour force in rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  I congratulate you personally on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to that office and also as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Prime Minister said prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 2 December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the impending Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> which will doubtless bring new senators into this chamber and against the risk that some new senator, having done his homework on the Standing Orders, could on the ringing of the bells come streaking into the Senate and rise uncovered and address you, will you,  Mr President,  have the Standing Orders Committee look at the standing order to which I have referred? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the Whitlam Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to establish clear ground rules, why has not the Government done so? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators know full well that the Government proposes that these referendums be held on the same day as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is not all about whether the 2 Houses ought to come together for <span class="highlight">election</span> on polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A double dissolution would bring about simultaneous elections of the whole of this chamber and of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not even necessary to hold a double dissolution to bring the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives back to the same date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could, if it wished to do so and if it had the courage to do so, take out the House of Representatives at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- that is, when those honourable senators who are due to retire at 30 June 1974 have to face their electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963, as the Senate will recall,  Sir Robert  Menzies called an <span class="highlight">election</span> for November or December that year, although the House of Representatives need not have gone to the polls until about that date in 1964. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible, in the time available between now and the date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, for this proposition and, I understand, four others, if the Government has its will, to be placed before the people and for an explanation to be given to the people at large about precisely what they are votting on? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the will of the Government that the parties should have no time to campaign for the return of their senators, or does the Government believe that in a fortnight’s campaign 5 propositions to alter the Constitution can be seriously debated for the understanding of the public, most of whom have not read the Constitution or understood what it means, and at the same time the functions which politicians have a responsibility to fulfil- that is, in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to place before the people their ideas, their programs and what they stand for- can be fulfilled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Government says that in the space of perhaps a fortnight, which it proposes to allow for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the whole ramifications of these proposals shall be discussed and fully explained to the people who will be expected to give an intelligent decision on the Government’s propositions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says: ‘Expense will be saved if the referenda are held at the same time as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had wanted to save money it could well have held a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in conjunction with the prices referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The prices referenda were held at about the usual time that a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been rumoured that in the month of May there will be a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in conjunction with 5 referenda questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to remind the Government of what the Constitution says about Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that the <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill vacant places shall be made within one year before the places are to become vacant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has had a whole year in which to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> but is going to wait until less than 2 months before the positions become vacant before it allows the decisions to be made that will ensure the continuity of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that <span class="highlight">election</span> had taken place only 6 weeks before the expiration of the terms of service of the sitting senators the State of Victoria could have been without 5 of its representatives until such time as the Constitution was legally interpreted on this question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution says more than that the <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill the vacant places shall be made within one year before the places are to become vacant; it goes on to say that the term of service of a senator so appointed shall be taken to begin on the first day of July following the day of his <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be the position if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held only 6 weeks before the expiration of the terms of service of senators and if the writs have not been returned by the first day of July because of a recount? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Constitution the term of service of a senator who is elected at such an <span class="highlight">election</span> cannot begin until the first day of July of the following year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could not interpret 1 July 1974 as being the first day of July following their <span class="highlight">election</span> if their <span class="highlight">election</span> does not in fact take place until 2, 3 or 4 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that I am now quoting from a document which the Government is going to ask the people to alter in 5 different ways and that it is going to ask them to do so during the period of a fortnight while it is conducting an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator McAuliffe  can put any other interpretation on the words ‘the first day of July following the day of his <span class="highlight">election</span>’ than a date that follows the date of a senator’s <span class="highlight">election</span> he is a genius because no one else in the world could put such an interpretation on such a provision in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of its political cowardice the Government has not already got the <span class="highlight">election</span> out of the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well have got the <span class="highlight">election</span> out of the way, but it has postponed holding it until almost the last minute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With most Senate elections it takes 2.5 months before the final conclusions are reached, but this time the Government will be allowing only 6 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that he says that the words ‘the <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill vacant places shall be made within 1 year before the places are to become vacant’ means as long as the <span class="highlight">election</span> itself is conducted before then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The voting procedure is only a small part of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the political parties that are charged with the responsibility of performing this task have an opportunity to do so at the same time as they place before the people the campaigns for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of their candidates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One can agree with the stature in physical terms of the Prime Minister but from the attitudes that he has adopted from the time the <span class="highlight">election</span> speech was delivered prior to December 1972 until today one can see that the Prime Minister has ranged over a great variety of subjects and put forward a great front but that, in fact, in many instances his actions have underlined the fact that achievement of the things that he wishes to do is impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were given an indication that in the vicinity of $2m would be spent on the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if, after such an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held, the House of Representatives was placed in a very delicately balanced state and that House had to go to another <span class="highlight">election</span> in 3 months time, would the Prime Minister say again that the Senate, under this proposal, would come out for <span class="highlight">election</span> again? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a House of review in which half the senators go to the people for <span class="highlight">election</span> every 3 years and in which there was that continuing base of knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition is often advanced that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators involves a complicated system of voting, which it does, under the proportional representation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But attempting to impose on the people 5 referendum subjects will make it a most complicated <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held in May this year the average citizen in Victoria, for example, will be asked to look at the names of fifteen or sixteen Senate candidates and at the same time cast a responsible vote on another five or six constitutional matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Prime Minister was not reticent last December in drawing the whole of the Australian community into an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 2 referendum points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  arguments that there should be simultaneous elections for both Houses of the Parliament do not hold water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is that in all cases hereafter when the House of Representatives goes to the people for <span class="highlight">election</span> there should be held a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> simultaneously, irrespective of the circumstances that have brought on the <span class="highlight">election</span> and irrespective of the essential elements of the constitution of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was one of the few upper houses in European democracies that recruited its members by direct <span class="highlight">election</span> from the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the government of the day wished to be democratic and, on questions upon which the 2 Houses are divided, to take the verdict of the people it is competent for the Government to ask the Governor-General to dissolve the House of Representatives and the Senate and to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the entire membership of both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition that  Mr Whitlam  whimsically puts forward in a display of his passion for constitutional alteration is that on each occasion when a casual dissolution takes place in the House of Representatives there is to be a dissolution of half of the Senate, and that half should go to <span class="highlight">election</span> just so that the elections of the 2 chambers can be synchonised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only because there were spirits of independence in the government parties who were prepared not to echo the Government at every stage but also because there grew up on <span class="highlight">election</span> by the people minority parties and independent senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 in the Labor team for the New South Wales Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, joins the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in saying: ‘You have never had it so good’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this power that  Senator Murphy’s  Government is now seeking were at present in the Constitution no Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held in 2 months’ time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, if no Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> were to be held in 2 months’ time the Government could drift on from agony to agony for approximately a further 2 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Government wants this power; it does not want mid-term elections; it does not want the people of Australia to sit in judgment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being asked to write into the Constitution a power which would, in future, prevent any kind of mid-term elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would prevent a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> being held between elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aim of the Government, in introducing this legislation, is to bring elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives permanently into a parallel relationship, so that a separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> can never be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, they wrote into the Constitution the idea of the need for continuity in the Senate over a period of 6 years, recognising that in the popular or lower House there could be convulsion, that the term of office might be shortened, that a Prime Minister might well choose to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives before the 3 years laid down in the Constitution had expired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The founding fathers said: ‘Yes in the lower House a Prime Minister may seek to dissolve that lower House after one year or two years of office if he wished and therefore cause elections for that House to get out of line with elections for the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, if it wants to, can dissolve the lower House in the weeks immediately ahead, and bring about a twinning system by having a lower House <span class="highlight">election</span> and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the half membership of the Senate due to retire . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Elections for two Houses would them be brought together in the normal way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is stated frequently that we should not have separate Senate elections, that they are too costly and that they are annoying to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What a strange thing it is for the Whitlam Government, with its Rabelaisian tastes, a Government which will spend millions of dollars to race around the world in chartered aircraft, taking 70, 80 or 90 people along, including family, relatives, and loads of champagne, to suddenly say that we must not have elections because they cost money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can have all sorts of jaunts and junkets around the world, and we can spend tens and hundreds of millions of dollars on expensive public relations and propaganda campaigns for this Whitlam Government, but it is wrong to spend money on an <span class="highlight">election</span> which would ask the people what they think of the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to buy a couple of Boeing 707s from Qantas Airways Ltd to carry the Prime Minister and his staff around the world, but it is not all right to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> in mid-term because that costs money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To say that the people are annoyed and irritated with elections is really to argue for a dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If you do not have elections, you do not have democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us throw aside this idea that cost or the irritation involved in an <span class="highlight">election</span> is the thing to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We would not be having a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 2 months time if the power sought in this Bill were now written into the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could not have a mid-term <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the whole idea of trying to bring elections for the 2 Houses together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia who find it hard to understand the complexities of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Senate, the upper House, should keep in their minds that in every country where there is a democratic system, whether the Westminster system or the Congressional system, in almost every Parliament there are 2 Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some years the elections for the 2 Houses of this Parliament have been out of gear with each other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy for people to say: ‘Why should the Senate have a separate <span class="highlight">election</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elections for the 2 Houses, through a set of circumstances, parted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For some years Senate elections have been at different times to House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking back now over the period, I feel that the Senate elections being at different times to the House of Representatives elections is for the betterment of the Senate and of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe sincerely that a separate <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate means that the purpose and the rights of the Senate are more clearly brought forth in the minds of the electors, which is important because they decide who represents them in this chamber and in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the elections for the 2 Houses were held simultaneously, the practice was for the Prime Minister to deliver his policy speech, and the whole focus was upon the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate appeared to be an appendage to the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As time has gone on, with the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives not being held at the same time, I think that the Senate has been given more prominence in the public mind, and the public has a clearer assessment of the Senate, its working and its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understanding something about public reactions, I believe that separate elections for the 2 Houses is for the betterment of the Senate and for senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence we emerge as personalities and we get much more publicity and much more focus in public than we did when the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was an appendage to the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am one who believes that we should have elections each time an <span class="highlight">election</span> can determine an issue or can determine who shall govern the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One year there is a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, another year there is a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in between there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> for possibly both Houses of a State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one examines that, why should there not be those elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reflects upon why those elections are held, why ought not the justification to be readily expressed and readily accepted and why ought we not to say that this is the means by which we govern ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, as I have indicated, has used the argument that there are too many elections as the sole justification for this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believes that we should bring into line the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He postulates as a sound principle that every 3 years there should be a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and that at the same time- at the same <span class="highlight">election</span>- there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for that half of the Senate for which an <span class="highlight">election</span> is required at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Carrick  said and as other speakers said before him, it would be the easiest thing in the world for the Prime Minister to have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the same time as the coming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, at some stage in the future, it should be the desire of the Prime Minister of the day to have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at some time other than when the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held he would be able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">election</span> is unnecessary, what are the dangers attending the holding of a referendum and what are the problems which may arise if it is passed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that in putting forward this argument it may seem to ring somewhat hollowly against the proposition that if we were to have the elections together, as the Prime Minister may bring them together, it would be difficult to see what particular independent role of the Senate may survive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that only half the senators come out at any given time, but that will be the position irrespective of whether a referendum proposal, which requires that the synchronisation of elections should be a constitutional requirement, is carried or whether half the Senate comes out at the time that the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, which has been the general but not universal pattern of the elections which have been held since we have had a federation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My simple proposition is that if the practice can be departed from and if there is from time to time a separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> the ability to have a separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is worth preserving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, the Australian Labor Party, having been elected to power in 1972, were to be elected to power a second time in 1 975 and there were to be a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> on the occasion of each <span class="highlight">election</span> one would imagine that the Senate, at the end of the 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span>, would represent the view of the Labor Party as expressed at each <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did happen some 30 to 40 years ago that the House of Representatives went to an <span class="highlight">election</span> only 7 months after an <span class="highlight">election</span> had been held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the pattern were to be that senators were to have a term of office equal to only two House of Representative terms, one could find half the Senate being required to submit to an <span class="highlight">election</span> whenever the House of Representatives was called to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wright  indicated, the reasons why half the Senate would be called to an <span class="highlight">election</span> would not be based upon the Senate’s performance or on any sound or established constitutional criteria, but simply as a reaction to, an inevitable result of, what was happening internally within the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has permitted a pause- and when the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place there will be an indication for the Australian people as to whether of not they want the changes to be permanent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not sought to have that double dissolution and one can only draw the conclusion that the socalled obstructionism, impairment and frustration which he is experiencing is not of such a character that he must face an <span class="highlight">election</span> because of it <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Before the suspension of the sitting I was concluding what I had to say upon this Bill which the Government has introduced seeking a referendum to ensure that under all circumstances, notwithstanding what the situation might be, quite inflexibly, when an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives takes place there should always be an <span class="highlight">election</span> of half the members of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, it reflects the promise which the Government made to put to the people the proposition: ‘Let us have no more separate elections of the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The elected Government undertook to the people at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that it would put this proposal to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the elections of 1972, the new Government of Australia moved to give effect to an <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking related to the Commission’s activities, namely that local government authorities should have direct access to the Grants Commission to enable them to apply for special grants of financial assistance, in much the same way as States have access to the Commission for the past forty years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking you at the same time that we are having a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, so we can minimise the costs involved in holding the referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are honouring our promise by putting this matter to the people on the first possible occasion after the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> we wish to put it to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> the then Opposition made great play about local government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have only to ask honourable senators to recall the <span class="highlight">election</span> policies that have been put forward by the Country Party from time to time in regard to the helping of local government authorities with the provision of Federal finances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They relate to promises which were given in the policy speech by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1972 when he was Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are asking the Senate to consummate the promise he made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as honourable senators opposite were behind the times in 1971 and 1972, when their attitude caused them to lose the <span class="highlight">election</span>, they are behind the times on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to listen to the deep interest that the Country Party displayed in its policy speech for the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972.I challenge any honourable senator to ask me- I hope someone will- to table this document because it is very enlightening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The document titled ‘Australian Country Party, Policy Speech, Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> 1972’ was prepared for the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Greenwood  and to other Opposition senators that we have proof positive that before the <span class="highlight">election</span> this very proposal was discussed at a meeting in Brisbane with all local authority representatives throughout Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invite  Senator McLaren  to go out and proclaim that to the people of his State of South Australia during the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also invite my Labor Party colleagues from Western Australia to stand up during the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and proclaim the true objectives of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an Australian Government elected by the people wishes to put a proposition to the people to vote to change their Constitution, will any person in this Parliament deny the right of the Australian Government to go to its own people and say: ‘We ask you to change your own Constitution and we want you to vote in a free and regular <span class="highlight">election</span> on whether you choose to change your own Constitution’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740313_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I anticipate that there will be a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> before 30 June, with the date depending on whether one relies on the judgment of  Mr Whitlam,  Q.C., or that of the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that the Senate will rise for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> even though the other place may not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that, during this period of sitting, with the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Senate will not be sitting the number of hours that it sat last autumn session- it is a matter of straight mathematics- unless it is the Government’s intention not to have recess weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then are set out those provisions which governed the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the first Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no shape or form can it be called a Democratic Elections Bill because it contains nothing to define a democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> precisely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Countries all over the world are described as democracies, but whether they hold democratic elections in the true sense of that expression is very much an arguable point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merely to call a measure a Democratic Elections Bill does not mean that it attains that very high ideal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attempt by the Commonwealth to arrogate power to interfere in the domestic affairs of the States by informing them of the opinion of the Commonwealth and then seeking to make that opinion binding upon them in respect of what constitutes a democratic <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one studies the results of the recent British <span class="highlight">election</span> and if one keeps in mind the very clear enunciation of principle only a few days ago from the Government sponsoring this Bill in the Senate- the Government said it would fight to install a 2-party system of government in this country because it is the only proper way to get an efficient government- one sees the clash between the democratic ideals which the Government has placed in the name of the Bill and the Government’s intentions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party made enormous gains, but it gained no extra seats in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some commentators will state that Labour will be there only for a short period before there will have to be another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What purpose is to be served by placing before the people a referendum which merely enunciates that <span class="highlight">election</span> shall be by a democratic system of voting, when the system is not spelt out so that the people can judge for themselves whether the ideal which is contained in the name of the Bill will be attained? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose the most democratic form of <span class="highlight">election</span> is the proportional representation system which ensures that the representation in the parliament will reflect completely the will of all the people who are entitled to vote and which will give the minorities as well as the majorities the right to have voices in the parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is bound to create enormous hostility among the States, which have come together as a cohesive whole for the benefit of the whole nation and which would  never have come together if it had been suggested at the time of Federation that the Commonwealth would take unto itself the power to say to the States what it considers to be a democratic system of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is impossible to argue this case before the people properly because of the manner in which the Government suggests that it should be done, and that is, to conduct a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- to place before the people the intricacies of democratic elections, the various systems which could be argued for and against- and a referendum campaign in a mere matter of a fortnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures I received from an official in the Library show that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> Labor with 49 per cent of the votes, got 53 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the factors that leaps to the eye is that in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party won 19 per cent of the votes and gained 2 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This document I have, which was put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra, had this to say about the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> in the United Kingdom: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> result indicates an erratic correlation of popular support and parliamentary representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-During the <span class="highlight">election</span> speech of the Prime Minister it was announced that for the first time in Australian history we would be introducing a system under which interest payments on house mortgages would be a concessional taxation deduction and that the concession was to cut out at $ 14,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is merely intended to carry out an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed out then that this is the honouring of an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise which was specifically put in  Mr Whitlam  ‘s policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that the referenda are to be dealt with at the May <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his policy speech before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> stated explicitly that fee abolition would also apply to technical colleges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is scared to allow this matter to go before the people in conjunction with the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> because it does not want to be in a position where it is opposed to four of the questions that will be asked in the referenda or, if it is preferred, referendums, and in support of the fifth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was one thing which the Labor Party did not choose to make clear to the public at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A promise was given prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that taxes would not be increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen this great socialist philosophy in the Government’s policies in the last year but it was never mentioned when Labor was putting its policies forward prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He should read his own Prime Minister’s policy speech announced at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that on the Authority we will have at least a couple of public servants, a couple of part time people and a  chairman  who I hope will be an authority and not a member of the Australian Labor Party who will be defeated at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sure that it will win in this Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> as it has won in the last 3 Senate elections, in spite of the stories from the Australian Labor Party that it was withering on the vine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not on the air today and I do not want to discuss the <span class="highlight">election</span> which is about to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740319_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I call upon the Government as a matter of urgency to do something about implementing the promise which the Prime Minister gave at the <span class="highlight">election</span> and to take note of the fact that there are a large number of people today who are concerned about, who are affected and hurt by, the imposition by this Government of the highest rate of inflation that we have had in the last 74 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that he took any real part in the actions leading to an increase in interest rates, but I believe that the Prime Minister primarily understood what the Labor Party was quite deliberately doing, particularly to people with whom Labor had entered into a contract in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in order to win their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because one Party- the Australian Labor Party- recieved a very small surplus of seats and votes at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, that does not mean that that Party should have a completely open go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> we will see quite a swing against the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that  Mr Whitlam  is quite crazy having the referenda questions at the same time as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> when his Party became the Government,  Mr Whitlam  made a statement that he had to admit that there was a vein of authoritarianism inside the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740320_senate_28_s59/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, is related to the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech in 1972 and the Prime Minister’s commitment to establish a pre-schools commission as part of the program of national enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government introduce this session legislation to establish a pre-schools commission to fulfil the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy commitment and thus avoid further delay in a national responsibility to provide adequate educational opportunities? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An interesting point that I note is that the  Chairman  of the organisation known as AUSTAC,  Mr Cummings,  who is now critical of the Government in this regard, is one of 2 people whom I actually appointed to the Council after he was unsuccessful in a ballot for <span class="highlight">election</span> to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is how these dates will fit in with the date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is whether it is suggested that a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> could be held and senators would not be permitted, because of the Government’s desire that the Senate should be sitting, to move around their electorates and to campaign for that Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first matter to which those questions give rise is the date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is time we were told what the date of that Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why has no indication been given by the Government as to when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this childish approach to the programming of Parliament has gone on long enough and the Parliament is entitled to be told when the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held and what the program is for the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that statement was made about 2 months before the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From my recollection, and I do speak from recollection, almost immediately thereafter I do not say it was cause and effect- the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is playing a cat and mouse game, which is a silly and childish game, in not stating when the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second aspect, of course, is to obtain some indication of what the Government’s intentions are with regard to the sittings of the Senate- possibly the sittings of both Houses of the Parliament- during the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it the view of the Leader of the Government in the Senate that the Senate should not rise to enable senators to campaign for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it his view that we should be sitting throughout the period of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> to which  Senator Greenwood  referred by quoting  Senator Murphy  was a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This <span class="highlight">election</span> which we are approaching is a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has an undoubted right to know what legislation the Government will ask it to consider and to pass or to reject before the time which it is reasonable to give for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties ought to indicate that we will require a period of 3 weeks in which to campaign, and we will cater for a program of legislation that can be properly considered and passed so as to leave a period of 3 weeks before the date on which the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> is a secret. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>’, the reply that we get is ‘We are not going to let you fellows know the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is rather mean and contemptible of the Government to be holding out on this question of the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These days you cannot go to a television or radio company and say: ‘I want to book some time for the <span class="highlight">election</span>’, for when they say ‘When is the <span class="highlight">election</span> coming on’ and you say ‘I do not know’, they laugh you out of the place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It knows the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is so far out of the country when he ought to be here supervising the passage of the country’s business through the Parliament that when I was in Western Australia for an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the other day, one of the pleas being made by people in the community was for Australia to have a resident Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government knows when the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held, lt is organising its campaign and seizing every possible advantage for itself, and it thinks that there is something shrewdly tactical in denying knowledge to the rest of the Parliament, which any honourable, decent and courageous government would give to us right away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had had the numbers it would never have given to the Government in power the co-operation that this Government has received; it would have jacked up immediately and said: ‘We refuse to go on unless you come into the open and tell us exactly how the business is to be organised and essential matters such as the date of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their then leader as Prime Minister at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> said that pensions, if his Government at that time had been returned, would ‘be increased in line with increases in the consumer price index’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 1 3 per cent increase in that $20 would mean that today, the third occasion on which, if a Liberal-Country Party government had been reelected, it would have increased the pension rate since the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>, the pension would stand at $22.64 for the standard rate pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, he leads the Labor socialist Senate team in Victoria at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740321_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very difficult always to enumerate the reason why political followings of various parties fluctuate at any <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It surprises me that the colleagues of the Country Party senator from Western Australia allied themselves with the Democratic Labor Party in what may be described as the national disaster alliance and lost votes much more effectively than any other party in the whole of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is extremely unfortunate that the things that we have done for Western Australian primary producers were not reflected in the <span class="highlight">election</span> result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, a Bill was introduced in 1 968, but it was taken off the notice paper at the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was promised by the Labor Party in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to remind the honourable senator that in the <span class="highlight">election</span> held in Great Britain recently in which the Labour Party secured a majority of seats, even if it had to form a minority government, Labour used as planks in its platform the nationalisation or greater government control of the off-shore petroleum resources in the North Sea and renegotiation of the European Common Market agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to revert to what I was saying before I was interrupted and to refer to the dishonesty of the State Premier of South Australia when he announced the establishment of a petro-chemical works at Redcliff during the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign a year or so ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was further fortified in 1 972 by the introduction of 2 Bills which were never passed because of the imminence of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, but they were Bills to which the Liberal and Country Parties were committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which were not buried but which were not debated because of the onset of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This man was sacked because he was a member of the Australian Labor Party and because he had accepted endorsement as the Labor Party candidate for the seat of Mallee at the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was not a kickback to a political party as is the case with the Country Party whereby it is getting enough money annually out of this one insurance company to finance every <span class="highlight">election</span> that it wants to contest in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I know that one very big department store marched out $50,000 for the Labor Party at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not mean to butt in about the margarine industry, because one of the big leaders in the industry found it convenient to throw a party valued at $10,000 for the Australian Labor Party after it won the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If I were  Senator Reid  I would have another look at the Western Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> figures before I laughed because I think that any laughing he will be doing after 18 May will be done a long way from Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One photograph shows the early part of the demonstration as being peaceful and orderly, with women with children in pushers quietly going about their normal procedures- a normal scene at <span class="highlight">election</span> rallies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span> it was 63.86 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am pointing out the error on the part of people like  Senator Reid,  well meaning as they may be, but misunderstanding the situation as I believe them to be, who suggest that a  speaker  would make the trip to Western Australia from the eastern States in order to antagonise a marvellous meeting, the best that has ever been held in Western Australia as far as numbers are concerned, instead of trying to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the manoeuvres of another Government which endeavoured to prevent the people from having a say in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor to  Senator Gair  the position has been looked into closely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The matter becomes important only because of the midnight manoeuvres of the Government of Queensland to endeavour to prevent an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the people of Queensland for the successor to  Senator Gair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated already to the Senate, I suppose that if it had not been for some endeavour by the Queensland Government to slip in and prevent the ordinary procedures applying- that is, an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the people of Queensland- the Senate would have been informed in some regular way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately because, as I said, of the manoeuvres of the Queensland Government in endeavouring to prevent an <span class="highlight">election</span> the matter has to be looked at in the light of exactly what events have taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This ‘Barnardisation’ of the Services, this defence run down which is destroying the morale and effectiveness of all 3 Services, is being presided over by that same  Mr Barnard  who in a major pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> address said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, on a fairly simple matter such as how many senators will be elected from each State at the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the number varies from day to day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As recently as a week ago, the Minister for Defence, in a futile pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> trip to Western <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With only a 6 Battalion Army, with a fighting force of less than 6,000 men, there is little likelihood of a battalion being stationed in the west, or, despite pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> statements, facilities being developed for the use of such a force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before each <span class="highlight">election</span> the menace of communism, of China and the Soviet Union was trotted out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the motion moved by the Opposition Leader in the Senate is simply a tactic, before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, to alarm the people about matters which are at present in good hands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can expect that before the Senate rises for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Senator Withers  will be moving a similar motion relating to the defence Services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Senate should take note that  Senator Withers  is simply playing the old political game of trying to float some scare propaganda before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in the same way as his leaders before him, including the great  Sir Robert  Menzies, who referred to the great Red perils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that we are getting close to an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the old fear bogy is starting to raise its head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For many years, at <span class="highlight">election</span> after <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Australian people have been brainwashed by the propaganda of fear that was put out by the opponents of Labor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span> was fought on domestic issues, and the government of the day almost fell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the so-called dangerous and realistic pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> acknowledgement of the fact that Australia was one of the most secure nations in the world, the Red and yellow peril campaign could only be made credible if supported by heavy expenditure on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every <span class="highlight">election</span> from the time our Party was established we have said that the defence and security of the country ought to be a primary issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, regrettably, the attitude was taken up by people not only on the side of the Australian Labor Party but also by some people who previously were sitting on the then Government side that Australia could look forward to 10 years during which she need not do anything about defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attitude was then taken up in the <span class="highlight">election</span> that defence was not an issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> was a fair one and Labor won it for the first time in 23 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The program was opposed by the Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party and the Australian Democratic Labor Party, and they were defeated at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties, which had been defeated at the <span class="highlight">election</span>, refused to allow the Government even to have this legislation considered or voted upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We invite the Government to take the issue to the people and to have either a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> or a double dissolution, because in that way the people will decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We as an Opposition were committed to the Bills which we introduced prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 and which we would have passed, as we said we would have done, if we had won that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part XVIII of the Commonwealth Electoral Act deals with the Court of Disputed Returns and states under division 1 which refers to disputed elections and returns:  183.- ( 1.) <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The choice of a person to hold the place of a  Senator by  the Houses of Parliament of a State or the appointment of a person to hold the place of a  Senator by  the Governor of a State under section fifteen of the Constitution shall be deemed to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> within the meaning of this section, and the provisions of this Division shall, so far as applicable, have effect as if that choice or appointment were an <span class="highlight">election</span> within the meaning of this Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On this basis I am of opinion that on some date before 2 April 1974, that being the date upon which writs were issued for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Senators from the State of Queensland, most probably on 2 1 March 1974 but possibly on 14 March 1974,  Senator Gair  ceased to be qualified to be a  Senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would receive material and opinions, hear submissions and come to a proper decision in a way which is expected of a body concerned with the rights of persons and which is especially concerned with the right to vote- something which affects every person who is entitled to vote in Queensland, candidates who might wish to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> and in general the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that, following the issue of a writ by the Governor of Queensland for an <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill 5 vacancies in the Senate, in compliance with a request from the Prime Minister, the Government’s attempt to assert that  Senator Gair  had vacated his seat under section 44 or 45 of the Constitution on either 1 4 or 2 1 March 1 974, and did not now need to resign as originally intended, deserves the gravest censure and the Government should resign.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The replacement is made at the first federal <span class="highlight">election</span> after the occurrence of the casual vacancy in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span> to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, there are other provisions under section 185 etc., which make it possible for an individual then to lodge a petition and to challenge the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> after the <span class="highlight">election</span> has taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not much better to clear up any doubt which may exist before the <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament did provide a method- a neat, tidy and eminently fair method when read along with the other sections in this Part of the Act- whereby questions of this nature might be resolved in advance of the <span class="highlight">election</span> taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am interested in this office of strategy and <span class="highlight">election</span> tactics which has been set up by  Mr Whitlam  and which is being paid ibr by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appreciate that this is an extraordinary kind of operation, but the attitude appears to be that this office of strategy and <span class="highlight">election</span> tactics was justified in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> when it nobbled an eminent ecclesiastic and that it is justified by its organisation of libel cases against the propaganda of the Democratic Labor Party at <span class="highlight">election</span> times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A document was sent out at the wish of the Government on about 21 March or so, or later for all I know, asking the States to prepare for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Upon being asked to nominate and appoint a successor, the Australian Labor Party nominated a person who had run third on the Australian Labor Party ticket at the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this basis I am of opinion that on some date before 2 April 1974, that being the date upon which writs were issued for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators from the State of Queensland, most probably on 2 1 March 1 974, but possibly on 14 March 1 974,  Senator Gair  ceased to be qualified to be a senator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But rarely did you get such impudent indiscretion on the part ofthe Crown and its advisers, who today are Ministers, or attempts so brashly made on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the purpose of traducing a member of the legislature and procuring a vacation of his seat for electoral advantage so transparently corrupt as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740404_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A handful of Liberal Senators could block the Opposition plan to force a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the criticism of the Minister for Defence that the recent decision about procurement was for political purposes, I ask: Have the decisions on defence procurement been rushed forward as an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator tries to hang the matter around our necks as a smear at <span class="highlight">election</span> time in an effort to produce an impression in the community which is not true. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are putting this Bill once more before the Senate because the introduction of an equitable and efficient health insurance program covering all Australians was one of our major <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and one which was clearly approved by the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then events took place in Queensland that preceded that resignation and commenced an <span class="highlight">election</span> as from the night of 2 April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are debating is the attempt of the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  to counteract the effect of that by antedating that proclamation of the commencement of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland and claiming that a casual vacancy occurred in this Senate on either 14 March or 21 March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly is impossible to accept the afterthought of  Senator Murphy  who has just conjured up this contrived forfeiture for the purpose of counteracting the astute move by the Premier of Queensland to commence the <span class="highlight">election</span> before an anticipated resignation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Parliament was dealing with disputed elections it provided in section 183 that the validity of any <span class="highlight">election</span> may be disputed by petition addressed to the Court of Disputed Returns and not otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a clear and specific direction that any question as to a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span> has to go before the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when it came to a question of vacancy other than under a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span>, Parliament carefully used the word ‘may’ without saying that it should not be determined otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, as under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, section 203 … the House has a discretion to refer such questions to the elections court, there can be no doubt that the House still retains power to determine whether a member duly returned has, subsequent to <span class="highlight">election</span>, become disqualified or for some other cause has vacated his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea is that a secret vacancy, contrived by forfeiture 20 days before it was announced to the public, can have any effect upon the duties of the Governor of Queensland with regard to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span> to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span> took place  Senator Gair  came up to me and said ‘I voted for you as  Chairman  of Committees’, and he proceeded to tell me what a bunch of drongoes were in his Party, including  Senator Little  who had voted for  Senator Webster,  and thus voted against his own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This culminated on the evening of 2 April in an action taken in the Queensland Parliament, through the Governor of Queenslandvery properly under the powers vested in him and in his Government under section 1 5 of the Commonwealth Constitution- to issue a writ for the coming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister had written to each of the State Governors telling them of his intention to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May and giving them the clear belief that they were to issue writs for that <span class="highlight">election</span> for 5 Senate vacancies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, under section 1 5 of the Constitution, the Governor of Queensland issued a writ and an <span class="highlight">election</span> is now in process for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 5 senators in Queensland, the <span class="highlight">election</span> date being 1 8 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span> to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This court shall be either the High Court, or the Supreme Court of the State (in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held) if the matter is referred to it by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Court of Disputed Returns has the jurisdiction to decide the validity of an <span class="highlight">election</span> or return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has various powers, including the power to compel attendance of witnesses, to declare an <span class="highlight">election</span> void, and to declare any person duly elected who was not returned as elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If any <span class="highlight">election</span> is declared absolutely void, a new <span class="highlight">election</span> shall be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to other questions, viz, questions concerning vacancies or qualifications of a member (Le., which do not involve the validity of an <span class="highlight">election</span> or a return), the House in which the question arises may refer the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court has similar powers to those which may be exercised by it when determining a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in addition, the power to declare that any person was not capable of being chosen on sitting as a  Senator or  member of the House, and to declare that a vacancy exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Senate has been set up so that half its membership comes up for <span class="highlight">election</span> every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally 5 senators from each State come up for <span class="highlight">election</span>, but in this case it would have meant that 6 senators would have been elected to represent Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was just a matter of letting the Premier of Queensland know that in this way the usual process of <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Senate would be altered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vacation by the former honourable senator- whether he resigned or forfeited his seat; however it came about- was prior to the issue of the writs and there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for 6 honourable senators in <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That simply means an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people will be deprived of a vote in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional consequence is that if the seat were vacated before the <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland there should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not brought these Bills up because it is interested in the health of the people; it brought them up purely as a little window-dressing for the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it wants to go to the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the now discredited health proposals of the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden),  that is the risk it takes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that, if the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  can only get up enough courage, with luck the people will have a double dissolution and there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What we are talking about is nothing but a piece of Government propaganda which is being produced in both Houses of the Parliament for electioneering propaganda purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740408_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that, notwithstanding this state of unpreparedness, a number of statements made by the leaders of the Liberal and Country parties claim that they have large sums of money available to fight an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the last requirement referred to by the honourable senator in his question which, incidentally, was a condition imposed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board last year on commercial broadcasting stations following the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government, there is also a statutory requirement in the Broadcasting and Television Act for all stations to devote 5 per cent of the total time of music broadcast by those stations to Australian compositions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, what actions can the Australian Government take if it is established that this organisation and other similar multi-national organisations interfere in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> was held the previous Government announced that timber sleepers would be used, as their use had some political implications in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The policy speech delivered by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in November of 1972, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, referred to pre-schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I compare the unfulfilled promises and the unfulfilled expectations with the promise that was made by the Liberal Party as part of the same <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply that as it is no longer if but when a double dissolution is to take placethere is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses of Parliament on 18 May- it is not possible, as the Act at present stands, for 2 members to be elected from the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having made those comments, we wish the Bill a speedy passage and look forward on 1 8 May to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 Liberal members for the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that we all agree that the Australian Capital Territory has come of age to the point that we are treating it in a somewhat similar way to that applicable to the States and giving the people in the Territory 2 elected members of the House of Representatives after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the last person who forgot to nominate as a candidate for an <span class="highlight">election</span> was not a member of our Party, but we are not infallible and some members of our Party may follow in those footsteps. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in Western Australia not been held until 1975, it is likely that the gap between enrolments in these 2 Divisions would have closed considerably. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister, quite rightly, goes on to say that if the elections had been held at their normal time and we did not have an <span class="highlight">election</span> until 1975 both of these seats would have come in under the 10 per cent arrangement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The health Bills are to come before us and they are purely an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have heard this defence statement today and it is purely an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill is to come before us and it is an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There it all is, window dressing for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot get over that and a piece of <span class="highlight">election</span> window dressing will not help. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will give some simple and clear illustrations of how phoney this defence statement is and to show that it is merely a piece of window dressing for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, went up there just before the State <span class="highlight">election</span> and tried to pull off that 3-card trick on the media and the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They knew his visit there was nothing but an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If 18 May is the date for the <span class="highlight">election</span> we will be back here early in June and we will be sitting on different sides again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our treaty partners, our friends of former years- particularly the Americans who helped save us from 1942-1945- must be saying: ‘What is to be our attitude to the new Australia under Labor which says on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, having done nothing worth while for 18 months “We will spend $356m somewhere at some time on some type of hardware for the defence Services” ‘? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope, but I know that it will not come true, that before <span class="highlight">election</span> day there will be enough decency, enough sincerity and enough sense of responsibility on the part of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)-  and God alone knows he talks enough- or the Minister for Defence to come out and say precisely: ‘This is the state of the defence Services of Australia as at this time, after 18 months of our government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not believe that it will be done but I know from now until <span class="highlight">election</span> day, in the weeks that lie ahead before we come back into government, that 1 will expose to the people of Australia the rottenness and the lack of policy of this Government, the lack of responsibility and the lack of ability to get up and say: Yes, Australia, in the matter of defence we think that we need no strength, we think that we need no equipment, we think that everything is safe and lovely- and we will just stay at home and waste money on the news media by advertising Parliament and such things.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, it does this in the face of preelection promises of the Labor Party that it would build its naval vessels in Australia and provide employment for the skills of the people in our dockyards throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a complete abdication of an <span class="highlight">election</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that the Government stated prior to the elections that it would build aircraft in this country and would employ Australian craftsmen to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So another one of the hundreds of <span class="highlight">election</span> promises has been broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nothing more than an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the Opposition’s job is normally to endeavour to show that the Government is doing something as an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From memory, that was introduced just before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, that was purely an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick by the former Government, just as this proposed expenditure on defence is an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been our intention, and we are fulfilling that, to reintroduce this Bill because we regard health as an important issue at any <span class="highlight">election</span>, but not the only issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was reintroduced on the day of and shortly following the announcement of the intention on the part of the Opposition parties to take certain action which might lead to an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives and part of the Senate or to a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an almost immediate response by this Government, it cynically and for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">election</span>- as clearly admitted by  Mr Hayden  in that statement which is reported at page 1075 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 4 April 1974- said that this Bill was reintroduced because the Government regards health as an important issue at any <span class="highlight">election</span>, but not the only issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick, and it is a farce that this chamber should have imposed on it the duty of dealing with health Bills which were discredited last year throughout the public debate that took place in relation to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A double dissolution would bring about simultaneous elections of the whole of this chamber and of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not even necessary to hold a double dissolution to bring the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives back to the same date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could, if it wished to do so and if it had the courage to do so, take out the House of Representatives at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- that is, when those honourable senators who are due to retire at 30 June 1974 have to face their electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind you,  Mr Deputy President,  that this health scheme has been changed so many times from the one originally proposed at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in November 1972 as to be virtually unrecognisable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the conclusion is inescapable: These Bills are an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>health was an important matter for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was examining the reason why these Bills might have been introduced again at this time after the announcement of certain action which would lead to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real reason is political gimmickry, as an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick, as a sham and as a fraud upon this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether one could ever have regard to the Government’s health proposals at any stage of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when one regards the general duplicity which has been employed in regard to this and some other actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my case to the Senate that the way in which we should regard the Bills, which were rejected last year, and in relation to which the Minister in charge of them has said in the other House that they are being reintroduced because, in effect, there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> and we can look broader than one might normally look in that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1 969 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the present Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam,  went right across this continent clamouring for reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat- I say it over and over again- that if the people who administer these health funds intend to divert the reserves of the funds into the next <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, we will go out on the hustings and defeat them on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we have a right to be returned at this general <span class="highlight">election</span> that is to be held on 1 1 May or 18 May’  Mr Acting Deputy President,  I make this point because it concerns me greatly that you are not able to see that it is relevant to indicate that this Bill, once disowned by the Government, has been reintroduced without a second thought being given to amending it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are putting this Bill once more before the Senate because the introduction of an equitable and efficient health insurance program covering all Australians was one of our major <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and one which was clearly approved by the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Government slipped this Bill into the Senate yesterday so that if there was a double dissolution it would be able to say again: ‘The Senate has rejected our health Bill for which we had a mandate at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of it is purely a political gimmick because the Government wishes to discuss in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign a myth of free medicine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In examining this Bill, we must look to the months prior to the general <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence the Government’s action in re-presenting the Bill is an attempt, in the light of a double dissolution or an <span class="highlight">election</span>, to bolster up an argument in relation to alleged or imagined frustration of the Government’s legislative program by the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resubmission of it here today is not a genuine attempt to get the Bill passed; it is an attempt to squeeze out some political argument that can be used at another time, at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the heading ‘Health’ the Prime Minister, in his policy speech for the December 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the remarks that they have tendered in the Senate today one would gain the impression that if by some mischance at some future <span class="highlight">election</span> they were re-elected to government they would continue with the hopeless, maladministered ramshackle scheme that the Australian people have had to put up with for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740409_senate_28_s59/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Australian Government is giving effect to its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy of making $1.50 per week pension increases each autumn and spring such actions have been completely nullified by the stated rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will he take note that the Australian Labor Party in that upper House of fat succeeded in forcing the lower House, the elected House, to an <span class="highlight">election</span> and that in that <span class="highlight">election</span> the people overwhelmingly endorsed the action taken to deny supply in the upper House by giving the Labor Party an immense majority which enabled it to become the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know that they will be obliterated in the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the statement made to the Senate last night by the Leader of the Opposition that if the Government did not jump he would push, can the Leader of the Government say whether  Senator Withers  has now advised him that  Senator Withers  does not have the numbers to reject the Appropriation Bills because South Australian Liberal senators now realise that a double dissolution will ensure the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Mr Steele  Hall to the Senate and so enable him to set up a power base for the purple Liberal movement on a national basis as was done by the late  Senator Cole  in 1955 in regard to the Australian Democratic Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say is that this really is not a ministerial statement; it is another in the long list of items of window dressing for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government would not dare go into an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Australia with the thought hanging over its head that it was considering a request from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to establish in Australia a base which would put the ANZUS pact at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This statement is another in the long list of pieces of propaganda that we will see during this <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice from the ranks of Government supporters an indication that they claim that this decision is just an ordinary routine decision which had nothing to do with the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have said that they are not frightened of any <span class="highlight">election</span> and will play a straight bat against anybody. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there had not been an <span class="highlight">election</span>, they would have had a good chance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am sure that they will watch the results of the elections most anxiously in the certainty that when the elections are out of the way  Mr Whitlam  will be able to show towards them the kind of friendship which in South East Asia has earned him the title of the running dog of  Chairman  Mao. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are about to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> and this Government is about to face its masters- and it is about to learn that the people of Australia want to belong to the free world and want to honour our alliance with the United States and those ideals, practices and objectives which we have in common with the people of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason, quite basically, is that there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition then says that it was a short examination, ‘you should go on with it because of the <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It never mentioned them prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1972 very little was said by the Labor Party about the plank of its platform providing for it to pursue a policy of nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition would not be worthy of its place as Her Majesty’s Opposition were it not to have taken steps which it has taken in respect of legislation for which there was no direct mandate given and no mention made before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of intention and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it is farcical to introduce the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill and the other Bills that it is proposed to introduce when the Senate is about to be dissolved for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of them are about to lose their heads in the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of motion add-  but not before the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people at the same time as the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Senate being of the opinion that- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of this exercise is to push him because we want an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just look at the 4 constitutional Bills which were trotted up and which one assumes will be part of the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Democratic elections, simultaneous elections and the rest of these phoney questions are deliberately put out to deceive the elector when he goes to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One would hope that if the Government were genuine in wanting to go to the people it would not oppose the amendment; it would gladly receive it; it would say that it welcomes it so that this can be the final instrument which pushes the Government, which ought to go and which for the sake of Australia must go, to an <span class="highlight">election</span> so the people can throw it out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think, from the <span class="highlight">election</span> results, despite that Government’s defeat, it must have worked pretty well judging by the support it got in the last State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One only has to remember what was said by  Mr Grassby,  the Labor Party spokesman on primary industry prior to the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The primary producers in Western Australia showed what they thought of the Government by their vote at the <span class="highlight">election</span> in that State a few Saturdays ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude of my Party is that an <span class="highlight">election</span> must be held on the issue of whether all power shall go to Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the issue of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this is the issue of the <span class="highlight">election</span>- I believe that it will be- I have no doubt as to its result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be no exception taken to your acceptance of the post if you take it after the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> when it will not affect the standing of the Parties’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A former member of Parliament who will be a candidate at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and a relative of the Minister have been placed in charge of this organisation which can make arrangements for large amounts of finance to be made available and patronage to be given in that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has only to look at the set-up and at the series of Electoral Bills which have already been introduced by this Government and which are to be submitted to the people following a victory in the <span class="highlight">election</span>, if the Labor Party achieves that victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, the Labor Party proposes to initiate an electoral system, if it wins this <span class="highlight">election</span>, under which a vote cast in a Labor Party electorate will carry with it infinite advantages over a vote cast in a Liberal electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat: This <span class="highlight">election</span> must be fought on one issue- the issue of all power to Canberra, the issue of the defence of the rights of the States, the defence of the rights of the family and the defence of all the other rights which are essential in any community such as ours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Country Party, the Liberal Party and the Australian Democratic Labor Party went to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 and they were defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We turn to smaller matters, such as the Superior Court Bill which had been proposed in the first instance by those in the Opposition and which was a specific part of the Australian Labor Party’s policy at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet when our Party spelled out before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the kind of legislation that we would bring in- at the <span class="highlight">election</span> we promised to bring it in and got the endorsement of the people and brought it in, what have we seen? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other measures in respect of which manifestly the Opposition has obstructed the Government in carrying out the policies which it put forward in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and undertook to implement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought to be recalled that when in the House of Representatives the Leader of the Opposition  Mr Snedden,  first spoke on this Bill, he said the Opposition would oppose it because if the Opposition were successful it would mean that the Government would have to go to the people and face an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that if in the Senate the Appropriation Bill was denied, then after the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had indicated that he was prepared to face on <span class="highlight">election</span>, we would pass the Bill forthwith to ensure that the moneys were granted by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When the chips are down the people of Australia will understand that we gladly accept the challange to go to the country, because this <span class="highlight">election</span> is not about this piddling quibbling amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> is about whether the people of Australia, who elected a government on 2 December 1972 to fulfil a certain program, wish to see that Government have the opportunity to fulfil its program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one good thing emerges from this <span class="highlight">election</span> it will be the disappearance of a party which has been an excrescence on the body politic in this country for so many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that, when it was announced that the date of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> would be 2 December,  Mr Whitlam  said that that suited him because that was the date on which Napoleon overcame a ramshackle coalition at Austerlitz. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave-  Mr President,  the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has attended upon  His Excellency  the Governor-General, and I wish to inform the Senate that  His Excellency  acceded to the Prime Minister’s request and granted an immediate simultaneous dissolution of both Houses of Parliament on condition that a definite assurance was given that the financial position was such that adequate provision could be made for carrying on the Public Service during the period of time covered by the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister proposed, with  His  Excellency’s permission, to inform Parliament of  His  Excellency’s decision and to at once ask Parliament to make pro-, vision for Supply to cover the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister also told  His Excellency  that he did not propose to invite the Parliament to do business other than Supply and that as soon as this was granted we should recommend him to prorogue Parliament immediately and proceed at once to the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister also assured  His Excellency  that the electoral machinery was in such a condition as to permit elections to be held after the dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that there is certain business which ought to be dealt with before the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask that the Senate co-operate to enable us expeditiously to get to the point at which the Parliament, including this half of the Parliament, may proceed to a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, when the Government asks for Supply, the Opposition has the impudence to put forward a proposition that it will not even debate the Supply Bills until such time as the Government has agreed to send the House of Representatives to a dissolution at the same time as the forthcoming Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President,  I suggest that in the circumstances the appropriate course is to move to deal with the measures that need to be dealt with in order to bring this House to an <span class="highlight">election</span> as speedily as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just heard the statement from the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Murphy)  on behalf of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that the Prime Minister has obtained the consent of the Governor-General for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when we ask the Leader of the Government when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held, he says: ‘I am not going to tell you ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the Prime Minister goes into smoke and he says: ‘I will now have to look into my crystal ball to find out when I am going to hold the <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he comes in and says: ‘There is going to be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then he said: ‘The Government is going to know when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is, but the Opposition is not allowed to know it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely we have not reached the stage in a democracy where the Government announces: ‘There is going to be an <span class="highlight">election</span>, but we are not going to tell the Opposition because we want to book all the halls and make all the arrangements first. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has a commission to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> on condition that he deals with nothing else but Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But do not run around saying that the Government is going to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> and its supporters will know the date but the Opposition will not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All he said was that the Government can have an <span class="highlight">election</span>, but it must be on the condition that no other business is dealt with by the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the shortage of time I do not have the opportunity of going through all the matters which brought me to a decision that because this was such a grave emergency I was prepared to vote that supply and appropriation be deferred until an <span class="highlight">election</span> took place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was to the effect that the Governor-General had acceded to the recommendation for an immediate simultaneous dissolution of Parliament on the undertaking of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that Supply and nothing else would be transacted in ParliamentSupply until the conclusion of the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>5) but that it does include Supply not until 30 June but for a proper period to encompass an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a piece of impertinence, presumption unparallelled and impulsiveness quite characteristic of what has led  Senator Murphy  to destroy the Government’s business in the short time it has been in office that he would suggest that he should not tell the Senate his program for the elections as a mere matter of courtesy, as an obvious right and entitlement of the Senate before it is asked to consider the Bill for Supply for the period which the Governor-General has stipulated, namely to the conclusion of the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we consider the propriety of Supply unless we know the period that the Government, after being advised administratively, says will be required to complete the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that period, to complete the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that the Supply is appropriatenothing more and nothing less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On my present understanding of them, I insist that the Senate is entitled to know and is obliged to know the period of the program of the <span class="highlight">election</span> before it can sensibly consider the Supply that is appropriate to be voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am waiting to know whether I am wrong in any respect in asserting that His Excellency has made it a condition that we shall deal with supply for such finances as are required to carry on the services of government until the completion of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It that is so, and I think that every member of the Senate has that understanding, it is essential that we be advised of the program of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and of the period proposed to be occupied by that <span class="highlight">election</span> as well as details of the writs, the nomination, the poll and the return of the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I urge that the whole of this Senate recognise the fairness of the requirement that, before we pass money for appropriation in compliance with  His  Excellency’s condition we know the program of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and the period over which we are required to finance the administrative services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am here only to advance a proposition that before I vote for any money Bill I wish to be satisfied that I am acting in accordance with the authority of the Governor-General and know the period to be occupied by the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a sense, this is what the <span class="highlight">election</span> is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point was that  Senator Wright  was demanding to know the schedule, the issue of writs and the rest of it for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We embarked on a course some 12 months ago- I am not trying to be provocative- to bring about a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, as I see the situation, the sooner we get to the people and have an <span class="highlight">election</span> the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whether the Government decides to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> the week before 18 May, on 18 May or on 25 May will not mean very much in the long term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the 3 Appropriation Bills, the 2 Supply Bills and the 3 or 4 other Bills which are before the chamber ought to be concluded so that at least I can get up, go home and start electioneering, because that is what I want to do more than anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am only concerned that I protect the position first of myself and secondly of my Party with regard to this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having given support to the proposition that we take parliamentary action to enforce a dissolution, it is a short-sighted view in the extreme, in my book, to say that we take the dissolution on any terms however brief may be the periods for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not be dissuaded by any intervention whatever so long as I have parliamentary authority to proceed to ensure that the program of the <span class="highlight">election</span> will not exclude him from the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One or more members of State Parliaments in Australia evinced interest and were endorsed to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand it is traditional that a Prime Minister does not announce the dates concerning an <span class="highlight">election</span> until he has to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Australian Government and the Party of which it is made up would be forever ashamed if they purposely called on the date for an <span class="highlight">election</span> to stop a person who had given a prior indication of his intention to stand and who had been endorsed by a major political party from legally nominating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that tonight all we want from  Senator Willesee,  whose word I trust, is an assurance that there will be more than 14 days from tonight before nominations for the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1974 close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">election</span> is being carried out in a state of great emergency because the Opposition in this place willed it to be so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to mess around with the dates that will be fixed for the <span class="highlight">election</span> to suit the convenience of everybody who has political ambitions and who has seen fit to resign from a <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Negus  did not desire an <span class="highlight">election</span> and he desired to speak on Supply tonight but he was denied that request. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he had designs to nominate for Parliament and died, would the whole <span class="highlight">election</span> be cancelled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is prepostrous that honourable senators here on the Opposition benches who have brought about an <span class="highlight">election</span>- whatever party we belong to- should now demand a postponement or something because of decisions of parties or individuals to resign to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span> which may or may not have taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would we have had to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> so that he could nominate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On its own admission it started from the jump, right from the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, to see that this Government was put out of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care who has to resign from any parliament or who is to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament and who is not to stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dates of an <span class="highlight">election</span> do not concern us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wright  claimed that everybody should be given an opportunity to nominate for this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I am trying to make is that the aim of this country should be to give everybody the opportunity to nominate for this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an emergency <span class="highlight">election</span> such as this, one probably is not given enough notice of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the possibility of a double dissolution or the dissolution of the House of Representatives was being talked about, there was no guarantee of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we were talking yesterday about the question of dates I said that it was impossible to give the dates as we did not know when the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be, but I promised  Senator Wright  that I would do my best to have this information supplied to the public and everybody concerned as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the questions of the date of the elections and whether or not this would be of some detriment to a  Mr Hodgman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has advised that the reason he has not announced the date of the elections is that he must consult the Chief Electoral Officer before advising the GovernorGeneral of the possible dates and also that there are formalities which need to be worked out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there are pending State elections such as the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Council in Tasmania which require careful examination as to possible dates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Act providing for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators and because many of these Acts have different requirements, the Prime Minister has had to consult the Chief Electoral Officer about the dates for the issue of writs and the closure of nominations to see that the dates chosen meet the requirements of each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will most likely be seeing each other somewhere, perhaps not on the same platform, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that in spite of the political arguments we have here that even during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we will have the same sort of friendliness and respect, one for another as people, which most of us have in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope we will maintain this respect during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign no matter for which Party we are campaigning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those who may be returning, for those who may leave us, the Country Party extends its good wishes to all of them and wishes them well in the next months as they go to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward with confidence to the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in the next few weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we are all going to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I offer my thanks to you,  Mr President,  and extend my good wishes to the rest of the Senate in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be back here to bid them welcome when the new Senate is gathering after the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I put the question I would like to say on behalf of all honourable senators- I know that I am speaking on behalf of all honourable senators- that it is with an immense amount of regret that the Senate acknowledges that  Senator Cant, Senator Wilkinson  and  Senator Dame  Nancy Buttfield will not be returning after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-68-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator WITHERS (Western AustraliaLeader of the Opposition)-  Mr President,  on behalf of members of the Opposition may I offer our congratulations to you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> this day as  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Australian Country Party I wish to join in the congratulations being extended to you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> by the Senate to the office of  President,  which is perhaps the highest honour that can be extended to any member of this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators, I should like to thank all those who have spoken and congratulated me on my <span class="highlight">election</span> to the office of  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have to report that, accompanied by honourable senators, I presented myself to  His Excellency  the Governor-General as the choice of the Senate, and  His Excellency  was pleased to congratulate me upon my <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#debate-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, on behalf of the Opposition, I congratulate the Leader of the Government and the other Ministers on their <span class="highlight">election</span> and appointment to ministerial office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I thank the Senate for the honour conferred on me by my <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees of the Australian Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, I congratulate  Senator Webster  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator MURPHY (New South WalesLeader of the Government in the Senate)- On behalf of the Government I congratulate  Senator Webster  on his re-<span class="highlight">election</span> and elevation to this important office in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740709_senate_29_s60/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although perhaps this is not the ultimate judgment, I recall that it was Nick McKenna who, up to the time of his retirement from politics, always polled more votes than any other in Tasmania in a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to take the opportunity through you,  Mr Deputy President,  to congratulate the  President  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to that august office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate you,  Mr Deputy President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an honour to be present in this place representing Tasmania and the Australian Labor Party, particularly in the circumstances in which this Party has been re-elected to office in an <span class="highlight">election</span> not of its own making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Labor Party was treating inflation rather like a bush fly- content to have a swat at it now and again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Australian Labor Party manipulated with relish the March quarter cost of living figures in order to paint a rosy picture of the country’s inflation rate, but its manipulation could not halt the worsening of our country ‘s economic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite <span class="highlight">election</span> claims that interest rates would be reduced as soon as possible, we have witnessed this week a leap of 2 per cent in the bank interest rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister now intends to limit the growth of the Public Service, one of the measures which we suggested as imperative many months ago and a measure which we promoted during the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> compaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in defiance of its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy, it attempted to introduce compulsory unionism for Commonwealth public servants; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before doing so I should like to join with my colleagues in congratulating you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to your high office which I am sure you will discharge with dignity and impartiality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to congratulate you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to office yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 1 8 May we elected 60 senators and 127 members of the other House, a total of 187, and the last position to be filled, the 187th, is the one which I have the honour to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> did more than that,  Mr President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in suggesting that this Senate is identical in any way with the Senate which ceased to exist before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are troubled because the promises made before the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1 972 have not been translated into the kind of action which people expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote again from the <span class="highlight">election</span> pamphlet which was put out by the Labor Party before 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before my <span class="highlight">election</span> I was always impressed with the work that the Senate could and did do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> produced a result in Western Australia which has proved once and for all that right wing fringe elements like the secessionist movement have no appeal whatsoever to the people in my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be remembered that when we last addressed the Senate it was on an occasion when the Government was finally driven to a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are born within a bed that is countenanced by peers entitled to inheritance they can come into the House of Lords without <span class="highlight">election</span> or summons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia the Senate owes its <span class="highlight">election</span> to the general suffrage, the adult vote, of the people on as wide a democratic basis as the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Australian House of Commons, the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This House is just as contemporary as the House of Representatives and entitled to claim direct representation from the people at the same <span class="highlight">election</span> as the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same <span class="highlight">election</span> constituted the Senate in such a way that the Labor Party section of it does not have a majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throughout the period from December 1972 until 18 May last, until the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, they seemed to feel that like the Stuarts’ divine right of kings, they have a divine right to occupy the Government benches, that it is not their place to be on the Opposition benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Leader of the senators opposite saying that if his Party was returned as the government he would cure inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But before I conclude I should like to refer to the conduct of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the method of campaigning that was adopted in Queensland in the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was the most distasteful and disgraceful that I have experienced in 30 years of political activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would prefer to regard the Premier of Queensland as the symbol of political life in that State, but his over-enthusiasm in his campaign activities in the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> left a lot to be desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But can I replace it by saying that some of the activities of the Country Party in Queensland in the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign could be regarded as tactics that one would expect to be adopted by a political thug. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the outset,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  may I congratulate you upon your re-<span class="highlight">election</span> to your high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Treasurer hopes, as he hoped before, that interest rates will come down to 2 per cent or 3 per cent which was his goal before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Party which before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> said that it would leaven interest rates is now forcing the general overdraft interest rate up to 1 1 and 12 per cent, creating enormous hardship to ordinary people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We seek only to introduce and perpetuate, as far as possible, the principle of ‘one vote, one value’ and to ensure that the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> will reflect the opinion of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I will refer to the results of the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 18 May 1974, because they so adequately illustrate the inequity and injustice of the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Minister give an undertaking during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Government would assist in facilitating the extraction of the rock phosphate deposits in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Minerals and Energy and I issued a joint statement on this matter during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 senators each for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and that such senators have the same powers, immunities and privileges as senators representing the States; that the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators be held at the same time as the next Senate elections in the several States or at the same time as the next general elections for members of the House of Representatives, if such is held before or in conjunction with the next Senate elections; that the term of the first Territory senators be from the date of their <span class="highlight">election</span> until the eve of polling day for the ensuing general <span class="highlight">election</span> for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first <span class="highlight">election</span> for Territory senators, elections be held at the same time as the general elections for members of the House of Representatives; that after the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators, the terms of Territory senators be the period between each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>; and for the Territory senators to be elected under the same system of proportional representation as that currently applicable to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators representing the States, except in the case of a single casual vacancy when such vacancy shall be filled by the holding of a byelection adopting the procedures used for filling a single casual vacancy for a State senator, as far as may be applicable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to term of office proposed by the Bill for Territory senators I would remind honourable senators that 16 years ago the Constitutional Review Committee, upon which all parties were represented, recommended that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the senators every time there was a general <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bringing elections for Territory senators into line with House of Representatives elections accords with the recommendation of that Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Bill, after the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators, both senators for each Territory will be elected each time there is a general <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently in respect of representatives of the Territories there will be elections for both Houses of Parliament at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to congratulate  Senator Webster  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was catapulted, somewhat unexpectedly, into this Senate by the ill-considered decision of the Opposition to force a double <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Parliament on 18 May, and I represent the State of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of Western Australia, to the best of my knowledge, has the distinction of being the original slow learner in the field of interpreting and evaluating <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the Premier of my State and I remind honourable senators who are not terribly familiar with the <span class="highlight">election</span> result in Western Australia- in that State the Labor Party increased its representation to both the House of Representatives and in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to  Sir Charles  Court the result of that <span class="highlight">election</span> constituted a ‘stern rebuff’ for the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is regrettable that  Sir Charles  Court’s post-<span class="highlight">election</span> trip into the realm of fantasy, was not an isolated deviation, but is consistent with the long-standing and widespread propensity within the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party to stand truth on its head. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government recognises that although the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> resulted in the return of the Government it has not resolved the real differences that are being felt by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen, in addition to this type of campaigning, corruption used on a scale which, if it were used by individuals in the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, would vitiate the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen intimidation used by Ministers of the Crown in their ability to use, during the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, officers of their department to ensure that what is favourable to them is published and what is unfavourable is prevented from being published. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw in the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1972 the promise of massive performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unreasonable to look at promises made during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to the effect that persons on or below a certain income level will be able to have their interest payments deferred into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government claimed that its policy of first establishing a Prices Committee and a Prices Justification Tribunal represented an earnest of intention to act to protect the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I am amazed that members of the Opposition do not seem to understand that they lost an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they continue to take the view that the Australian people did not really vote for Labor at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, they will continue to be disillusioned in future and they will never develop the ideological core and reason for existence which they need and which we on this side of the Senate need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have done some research as to the reasons for the <span class="highlight">election</span>, and I find the contest quite clearly outlined in statements by spokesmen for the Opposition Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to determine that is by an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Opposition forced on the nation an <span class="highlight">election</span> which should never have been forced, not only because the reasons for forcing it were not good reasons but because it was not in the Opposition’s interests to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the policy speech which I gave before the <span class="highlight">election</span> I said that it was the wrong <span class="highlight">election</span> at the wrong time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel somewhat resentful, because I am a good Liberal, that the people who caused this <span class="highlight">election</span> are now responsible for the power that the Labor Government has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wondered why, for so long after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, these people who have given the socialist Government of Australia the power to socialise, as we will obviously find out at the joint sitting, continue to blame the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have expected a different tone in the debate, but listening to it so far it would appear that we are to have another <span class="highlight">election</span> in one month’s time because the Opposition, in denigrating the Government- I can lend a hand in doing that when I get going in this place- has given only a recital of the problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their speeches are reminiscent of the futile Liberal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign which started with a promise that interest rates would be reduced and which ended with an admission that they might rise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an <span class="highlight">election</span> situation as regards the promises and assessments of our needs in which the Opposition is doing no more than simply criticising the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On its <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1 972, the Government established a Health Insurance Planning Committee to develop in detail the proposals which had received such solid community support prior to and during that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take the opportunity, as have other senators, to congratulate you,  Mr Deputy President,  and the  President  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the 2 highest offices that the Senate can bestow on its senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We all know that he has a great deal of parliamentary experience but I was rather intrigued to hear him put forward his ideas in regard to the timing of the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held on 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to him that those of us who were on the Opposition side of the Senate before the decision was taken to hold the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May gave long and careful thought to the action we were taking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only point I have to make on this is that since the general <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition has had a good look at its policies and has updated some of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This debate is the third Address-in-Reply debate that we have had since Labor won the 1972 general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can see that the GovernorGeneral ‘s speech was based on the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> policies of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government won the May <span class="highlight">election</span> with less than 50 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable senators to remember the full page advertisements, which appeared in the Press before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, proclaiming in the boldest type that Whitlam had beaten inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was in May 1974; and now, in July 1974- in fact, ever since the <span class="highlight">election</span>- the Prime Minister has shown by word and deed that the rate of inflation was never checked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President, I offer my congratulations to you upon your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the high office of  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I offer my congratulations to our  President  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to that very high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government should consider the proposition put forward by the Liberal and Country Parties during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and look at the leadership of some of these unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the Government should look at this aspect, introduce the holding of secret ballots for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials and insist that all trade unionists in Australia vote at such elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest as a positive move- as a positive example of the policy of the Liberal-Country Party- that the Government should introduce legislation to provide for the holding of secret ballots for elections of union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if that happened the average trade unionist in Australia would vote at such an <span class="highlight">election</span> and would see that the irresponsible trade union leaders were thrown out of office and replaced by fair dinkum Australian workers who have the interests of their fellow workers at hean. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the State governments have recognised the importance of the policies that were promoted by the Liberal and Country Parties during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign because they have agreed that our proposition with respect to the handing over of some temporary control of wages and incomes is a wise one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Premier of South Australia would agree with my statement that our propositions during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign were the right ones. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On looking back to the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I note with a lot of interest and cynicism the promises made at that time by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitiam). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister said: ‘We will see that a contract is signed so that the State of South Australia will be provided with that dam’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another matter which arose during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and which greatly amused me illustrates the significance of the Press reporting things during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in a slightly more responsible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall reading in the Adelaide ‘News’ about a week before the <span class="highlight">election</span> a report that the Federal Government would provide $2,000m for the construction of a water treatment plant at Port Pirie in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment to the motion and, together with members on this side of the Senate, will continually strive to promote our policies so that at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> we will throw you people opposite off the Treasury bench and give the people of Australia responsible government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask  Senator Greenwood  to accept that his Party was defeated at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and not to adopt the Snedden attitude, which is that if he had had a majority of two or three he would have had a mandate to govern but because the Whitlam Government has a majority of two or three it has no mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some manufacturers in Australia who, prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, were stockpiling goods in the remote and feeble hope that there would be a change of government and that they could get away with marking up the price of their goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant that during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the average small to medium sized Australian business and some of the larger Australian companies gave their donations to the Australian Labor Party because they knew that they would get a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An amount of $2m was poured into the funds of the Liberal and Country Parties to help fight the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the National Party or the Australian Country Party- whatever it is called in Queensland- who were handing out howtovote cards on <span class="highlight">election</span> day were being paid $25 each to hand out those how-to-vote cards on behalf of the National Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I wish to congratulate you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the very high office of  President  and to congratulate  Senator Webster  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign it became confused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was reminded by my colleague,  Senator Wood,  a few minutes ago that the Australian Labor Party relied upon a foreign owned company in the last 2 elections to manage its <span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> the question became confused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Attorney-General aware that immediately prior to the May 1974 general <span class="highlight">election</span>, officers of the Fitzroy Legal Service and the Springvale Legal Service in Victoria wrote on the official letterhead of their respective offices to clients and former clients urging electoral support for the Australian Labor Party? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the AttorneyGeneral make inquiries to ascertain whether, prior to the recent general <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Queensland Law Society sent out to all its members an official notification that they should vote against Australian Labor Party candidates because of the fact that the Attorney-General had instituted free legal aid in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would mean a redistribution before each <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We seek only to introduce and perpetuate, as Tar as possible, the principle of ‘one vote one value’ and to ensure that the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> will reflect the opinion of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the Act in its present form ensures that, because at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives the Australian Labor Party obtained 49.3 per cent of the primary vote and 51.96 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: Does the Labor Party claim that the results of the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 1 8 May were not fair and just? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that result was a very good example of the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> reflecting the opinion of the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most fascinating result in Western Australia in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> was, of course, in the electorate of Stirling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> there was fascinating not only because of the closeness of the count and the recount but also for quite a different reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have just seen one of the re-distributions undertaken by the Government of which  Senator McLaren  is a supporter and we have just seen an <span class="highlight">election</span> supervised by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they care to look at the figures for the <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 1 8 May last they will discover that, in fact, the Opposition and Government supporters in the House of Representatives represent electorates of approximately equal numbers of electors, and no proposed redistribution could provide a fairer equality of representation than that which exists today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only reason the Government has introduced this Bill is to enable the Australian Labor Party to hold a redistribution before the next <span class="highlight">election</span> on terms more favourable to itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the legislation is passed and a redistribution is carried out, it would be the first time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament that a set of boundaries would be used for only one <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This rapport between parliamentary representatives and their electors will be lost if we are to start having redistributions before each <span class="highlight">election</span> or random redistributions held whenever a politca party thinks one necessary for its own advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-If I may interpose to answer as a matter of interest those useless and quite irrelevant interjections, at no time between 1949 and 1972 did your Party receive a majority of the primary vote above the Liberal-Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party except in 1954 when your Party ought to have won the <span class="highlight">election</span>, but that was held on boundaries set by your Party in 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results of the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> show this clearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Even with the natural movements in population and the entry of 1 8-year-olds onto the electoral scene, the <span class="highlight">election</span> results still reflected, with uncanny accuracy, the preferences of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> show that there is not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me take the position a little further and commend to Opposition senators that series of very analytical articles headed ‘<span class="highlight">Election</span>- 1974’ which were produced by  Mr David  Solomon in the ‘Canberra Times’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be found that the total number of votes cast for the 128 Government candidates who stood at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> exceeded the total number of votes cast for the 174 Opposition candidates who stood for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, in my State of New South Wales it was remarkable that in the 1954 federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Party nearly won the seat of Robertson, but by the time of the next federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, after a redistribution had occurred, the position was entirely different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party was very quick to allege in the recent general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Opposition was refusing to obey the umpire’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This, I believe, would bring about a chaotic situation in which every <span class="highlight">election</span> would be fought on new boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, the Labor Party won the <span class="highlight">election</span> and it has the authority to proceed with this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If my memory is correct the Australian Labor Party obtained 49.9 per cent of the vote in the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 and won just over 52 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made his attack on these officers after they had been engaged in an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the like of which had never before been seen in this country because the double dissolution of the Parliament culminated in an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate as well as the referendum questions which were put to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the benefit of the uninitiated who do not know what happens in Queensland under a Liberal-Country Party regime, I will very quickly give some statistics of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> held in that State in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It remains true that the Whitlam Government is charged with the same executive responsibility as it had before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government’s share of the vote for the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> fell and its majority in that House was reduced in spite of the fact that it won extra seats in the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the people returned the Government, but the <span class="highlight">election</span> that took place was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses of the Parliament, not for one House of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can anybody tell me that the Bill that is before us tonight and the rest of the Bills in respect of which the Prime Minister sought a double dissolution were issues in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Daly’s  electorate of Grayndler is a striking example because when the last redistribution was drawn he had a number of electors above the quota- I forget the actual percentage but it was something like 7 per cent as I recall it-and when the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> was occurring the number of electors in his electorate had fallen below the quota because there had been a movement of people out of his electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking that fundamental fallacy, that speech by  Senator Steele  Hall, who has just returned to the chamber, entirely ignored consideration or understanding of the fact that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government put forward a referendum not for one vote one value but for electorates to be divided according to quotas of population including qualified electors and unqualified electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The referendum was defeated, and the Labor Government, which at one time espoused the principle of one vote one value and which at the <span class="highlight">election</span> espoused the cause of electorates equal in population, was defeated in the Senate where  Senator Steele  Hall and I have our responsibilities to cast our vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wood made the point that this was not really an issue at the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that the people had voted on all sorts or things-whether they liked the colour of one’s tie or eyes or something like that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740716_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that <span class="highlight">election</span> is due to be held this weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May had not taken place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was clearly expressed in the policy speech of the Government and in the statements made by many of those involved in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that it was the intention of the Government, should it be returned to office, to give to the residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the same facilities as are given to residents in the rest of Australia as far as Senate representation is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does any honourable senator opposite seriously believe that the Labor Party, which at present cannot win the one House of Representatives seat for the Northern Territory, is going to win the 2 Senate vacancies in the Northern Territory, if they are created, or is the <span class="highlight">election</span> to be decided on the basis of each party receiving more than 33 per cent of the vote which would be required to elect a senator? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Largely the same senators will speak on these matters as spoke on the previous occasion, seeking to deny the results of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and seeking to deny the Government the opportunity of bringing in even the simple Bill that is now before us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise that the Australian Labor Party won the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, that it has some right to introduce legislation into this place and that we should give it due and proper consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in the States convincingly rejected the Government’s referendum proposal for <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators at the same time as members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter went before the people at the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this legislation is passed the result of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Northern Territory will without any doubt be that the other side of this place will get one representative and this side of the House will get the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is this fantastic result of two on the Government side in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Northern Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He ought to realise that there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 and an <span class="highlight">election</span> again last May and that the Government won both those elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since these matters have been put to the test twice and an <span class="highlight">election</span> held again because of their rejection, surely the honourable senator would accept that the Government has a right and- to use that horrid word- a mandate to- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to take the view that the Opposition generally takes that this chamber is a second seat of government, there may be some reason for showing concern at disturbing the type of <span class="highlight">election</span> of members to a second seat of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact, as may appeal to  Senator Steele  Hall, that if this Bill goes through and that then at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> 2 senators are elected from the Northern Territory there will be only one member of the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the great representation, which was accepted at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, of  Mr Sam  Calder, the present member for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes that the extra senators would be elected at a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 2 years time and would contest their <span class="highlight">election</span> at the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators remember  Mr Whitlam  saying: ‘We believe that there should be a synchronisation of the elections for the 2 Houses of Parliament’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a wonderful opportunity this would be for the Prime Minister to cut his term short by a year and to synchronise the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> with the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> before July in 2 years time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But no, under the proposals of the Labor Party, the senators will be elected in 2 years time, they will come up for <span class="highlight">election</span> in another year and they will come up for <span class="highlight">election</span> in another 2 years after that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides also that their method of <span class="highlight">election</span> should be totally different from that of State senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are to be elected at their first <span class="highlight">election</span> at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and thereafter as each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> occurs two of them shall come out and stand for reelection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also would have 2 different systems of <span class="highlight">election</span> to elect one body of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Steele  Hall has not made clear to us where he stood before the <span class="highlight">election</span> in regard to the representation of these 4 proposed Senate representatives but he argues now about a Government mandate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have expressed through rejection of the referendum proposal the simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then we have been through the double dissolution and the subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> which we all recall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties did not lose; they merely came second in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be an obliteration, such as we saw at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, of many more honourable senators opposite if they insist in attempting to deny democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So with the Whitlam Labor Government having been defeated in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> following the double dissolution, having gained 29 seats only out of 60, and with the people being entitled to expect the other 3 1 senators to defend the cause of senatorial constitutional integrity, we are bound, when this Bill is presented to us after the dissolution, to give it the best of our consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather interesting that the question as to whether the Senate and House of Representatives elections should be held concurrently, which was one of the principal matters that the Government put before the people, was rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is trying to have the <span class="highlight">election</span> of territorial senators held on the same day as the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attempt to intrude non-State representatives into the Senate with terms of service the same as the terms of members of the House of Representatives, with elections to be held at the same time as general elections for the House of Representatives and with any vacancies of such representatives being filled at an <span class="highlight">election</span> as though it were a byelection for a vacancy in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, as already mentioned, requires the proposed representatives to be taken to <span class="highlight">election</span> at each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a proposal would make destitute the system of proportional representation instituted by a former Labor Government for Senate elections, which system has provided in the Senate a true reflection of the political feeling in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know full well Prime Minister Whitlam ‘s burning desire to take half the Senate out at each House of Representatives electionor is it his intention to take all the Senate to <span class="highlight">election</span> with the lower House and so completely destroy the Senate by making it a replica of the House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very simple Bill relating to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 2 senators from each of 2 Territories of Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But knowing the tenacity of members of the Opposition, who according to them did not lose the last <span class="highlight">election</span> even if they did not win it, I believe that they are determined to delay and frustrate good government in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because he could not deliver the goods at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> when he promised the oil companies that he would obtain a certain amount extra for every barrel of oil they produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Government’s figure for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes I presume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972, prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December that year, the Government put before the people its health program for Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, 1973 was the year of the so-called great debate which in a sense, ended with the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that <span class="highlight">election</span>, the timing of which was chosen by the Opposition, the Government obtained nearly 50 per cent of the votes throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Senate that if the people who voted in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of May 1974 were clear about anything, they were clear about one thing- that if the Government was re-elected it would introduce its national health insurance scheme, because that scheme was discussed throughout 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course in the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign a new factor was introduced; suddenly the Liberal Party produced a new health scheme of its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet suddenly, before an <span class="highlight">election</span>, a policy emerged- a son of Liberal Party jet lag of 4 years; Nimmo to Chipp, one might say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have our right by virtue of <span class="highlight">election</span> to have our say and to be heard, and it would be quite improper for the Senate to demand that these Bills be put through- guillotined through as happened in another place- without new members democratically elected having their say, being heard, and expressing their points of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return now to the ‘It’s time’ folders put out for our edification before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> in which all the promises were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sheil obviously does not think much of these 2 Bills or of the scheme proposed by the Government but unfortunately he made it obvious in his speech that he did not think much of the Liberal-Country Party scheme proposed by  Mr Chipp  during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have done an especially good job supplying the Opposition with public relations personnel, funds and supporting advertisements at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the Liberal and Country Parties proposed health scheme which was introduced prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, went a long way along the lines of our scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this subject was one of the main subjects at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We debated it during the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when we were defeated and the Liberal and Country Parties were re-elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia knew what it was that we were putting to them in that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was debated from the end of 1972 through to May 1974 when another <span class="highlight">election</span> was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They knew what the <span class="highlight">election</span> was about and they returned Labor to government on the very question of whether those 6 Bills should become law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, we hear from the Opposition that we do not rely on an <span class="highlight">election</span>, even if it was held only 2 months ago and even if it confirmed the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held 1 8 months before that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the double dissolution and the <span class="highlight">election</span> we were not able to proceed with the proposed joint educational broadcasting conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that the <span class="highlight">election</span> has taught him a lesson, that he will stick to his legislative functions and help the Government to deal with inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Labor Party claim in full page Press advertisements just prior to the May <span class="highlight">election</span> that the Prime Minister had beaten inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us remember that, although 49.3 per cent of the people voted for the Government at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, some 50 per cent or more of the people did not vote directly for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister pointed out that the proposal to create the Petroleum and Minerals Authority was given great prominence during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign following the dissolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to remind the Senate that this Labor Government both before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> and before the recent campaign for the last <span class="highlight">election</span> made great sound and fury about multinationals and their exploitation and about what it had done and would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740723_senate_29_s60/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Australian Government is giving effect to its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy of making $1.50 per week pension increases each Autumn and Spring such actions have been completely nullified by the stated rate of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, just last night we saw the Government welsh on its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to phase out the means test. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign preceding the contest on 18 May,  Mr Snedden  did no good for himself or his Party or our side of politics by coming to South Australia and saying he would not insist on a majority of Australian ownership in the Redcliffs plant on Spencers Gulf in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a tactic which might have some appeal for a few weeks, a few months and maybe for one <span class="highlight">election</span>, but sooner or later the falsity of the style will become apparent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It did not get beyond the second reading stage in the Senate because the Parliament was dissolved prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> being held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How much money will the Government save by breaking its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to abolish the means test? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel more keenly about this matter because in response to its invitation I went along to its hearings during the early part of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, at great inconvenience because it took up time that I would have wished to devote to the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We preached that; we went to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> on it; that was our policy then; it is our policy now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A colleague of mine who sought <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate in I think, 1968, and subsequently was elected to the House of Representatives in 1969, 1972 and 1973, recently made an examination of his financial position and found that he is now approximately $2,000 in debt when compared with his financial position when he started. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that every time increases in parliamentary salaries are mooted we are told it is not the rightime, that it is Christmas time, that we are just about to go into an <span class="highlight">election</span> or that there is a problem in the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, coming from  Mr Crean,  is worthy of note because it was not long ago, in fact just before the general <span class="highlight">election</span>, that there was no suggestion of any imminence of great strife, struggle and difficulty ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just gone through another <span class="highlight">election</span>- I do not say this in any spirit of partisanship- during which it was denied that there existed in Australia a dangerous economic situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators can read into that anything they like, but if there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> ahead of its due time I suggest to the Labor Party that it remember this day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740725_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>AND WHEREAS, since that dissolution and the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Twenty-ninth Parliament, the conditions upon which the Governor-General is empowered by section 57 of the Constitution to convene a joint sitting of the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives have been fulfilled in respect of each of the said proposed laws: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government make an early review of its recent decision to give child care much lower priority than it undertook to give this matter during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a rather surprising proposition in itself, because until halfway through the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we had found the Government’s attitude was that it ignored inflation; it tried to get everyone to believe that no such thing as inflation existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course we know that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  himself had to recognise the fact that inflation did exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can only gain the impression that in some way a hidden subsidy was paid to big business, which supports the Opposition parties at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They did not increase postal charges in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year even though such charges were warranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures show quite clearly that the last increase brought in by the former Government was in the Budget of 1970-71 which was brought down in August before elections were held in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of those increases which were introduced in a non-<span class="highlight">election</span> year- because the Government sought political expediency and did not want to become unpopular with the electoratein the following year, 1 97 1-72, some correction was made in the loss which was suffered by the Post Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The year 1972 was an <span class="highlight">election</span> year, so what did the previous Government do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But since the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government itself has expressed concern about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has to cast one’s mind back only a few weeks, to the <span class="highlight">election</span> period, to recall that the Government said: ‘There is no inflationary problem in this country; none whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But every now and again the previous Government found that it had to advance a proposition- not in <span class="highlight">election</span> years, as  Senator McAuliffe  said, but in other years- to increase Post Office tariffs in order to ensure that the earnings of the Post Office would not be less than the revenue and that there would not be calls upon taxpayersother than some fractional demands- to provide an amount of money to subsidise postal tariffs or telegraph tariffs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty-seven days after the day the Senate committee had been required by the Senate itself to report on the Bills, and still no report had been made, the Bills were again introduced in the House of Representatives and passed all stages, Parliament was dissolved for the <span class="highlight">election</span> 3 days later and the Senate again failed to consider the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill lays down that the first <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Assembly shall be held on 24 October 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be practically impossible, if this Bill does not pass through the Senate this week, for the <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held on 24 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nobody has made a promise that there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> by 24 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that was said on behalf of the Australian Labor Party during the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was that if the ALP were elected to office, as it was, there would be self-government for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the work of the Committee was delayed considerably by the double dissolutionit would have been delayed in any case because a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was to be held- because members of Parliament work on other committees and because Darwin, Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek are many miles away, not a great deal of progress could be made by the Committee in the period of 12 months since it started its work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that a very small proportion of the population is vitally interested in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to both the number and the manner of <span class="highlight">election</span> of Aboriginal representatives in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are, as I see them, that  the  <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on  24  October, the reason mainly being because the Minister took as fact that the elected members would resign if there was not an elected Assembly by the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who is to call an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If as the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 24 October there is a majority of non-Labor members of the Assembly, will the Government clamp down and say: ‘Right, you are not of our political colour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conversely, if there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> that returns a majority of Labor members, will the Government say: Righto boys, here are the jobs for you to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we members of the Committee should theoretically close our eyes to the fact that this legislation has become law, that there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> and that there will be an elected Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite visits by a variety of Ministers to some areas of the Territory where publicity appeared to be favourable, I do not think that the Minister will be able to point out where any positive statements have been made which could be a guide to those people who are likely to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> and who are likely to consider whether being a part of this Assembly is worth while. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the Senate is aware of the proposed times for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-<span class="highlight">Election</span> day is proposed for 19 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is a very important matter and I wish to deal with it; but let me make this point first: Nominations close on 11 October and <span class="highlight">election</span> day is 19 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it fair and reasonable to allow 10 days between the closing of nominations and <span class="highlight">election</span> day; or is the Government doing it for some subtle purpose, so that those who are in the centres of concentrated population will be able to cast their votes very readily and others will not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, its great principle of one vote one value will clearly be demonstrated to be lost in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the period of 20 days between the closing of nominations and <span class="highlight">election</span> day during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> was insufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More electoral officers will be needed, as they were needed at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly believe that it is ridiculous that such a short time should be allowed between the closing of nominations and <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not want to be provocative or bring this up, but the point is that both  Senator Webster  and  Senator Marriott,  and  Senator Webster’s  colleague in another place, have severely criticised the Government because we have had to bring in this measure now in order to honour a promise that we made during the 1972 elections and which is part of our policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He says there is no record of the Government having said that the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that an announcement concerning that matter will be made fairly shortly and before nominations close for the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The percentage of the community which voted for the Australian Labor Party in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> will rue the day that they did so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is designed to give effect to the Government ‘s decision, which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  foreshadowed during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, to strengthen the Prices Justification Tribunal and extend its scope in certain important ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the responsibility of members of the Opposition that not one cent of these funds has yet been provided as this Bill would have been passed several months ago but for the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in their inevitable fashion the men of the past finally realised in preparing ‘policies’ for the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> that the community demanded that the Australian Government, regardless of whichever party it was, take action in this field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a circle means that delays to this program, such as that which resulted from the action of the honourable senators of the Liberal and Country parties in forcing the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>, are even more intolerable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the injection of finance into public transport through this Agreement we will be able to rectify this wrong which was, to a large extent, perpetuated by the honourable senators of the Liberal and Country Parties by their failure to act whilst in government and then in their shabby approach in forcing the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> which delayed the introduction of our programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only way in which one as an Aboriginal or, for that matter, as a European had an entitlement to vote in a national <span class="highlight">election</span> was to qualify as an elector ina particular State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we would be waiting until after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> when the resounding victory of the Australia Labor Party would make all these things quite easy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740801_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has come about because despite two successive <span class="highlight">election</span> victories by the Australian Labor Party, despite the clear endorsement by the Australian people at the elections only 1 1 weeks ago of the Party’s policies and of the specific measures now before us, the Senate and the Opposition are still resolved to obstruct the Government’s program and to frustrate the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-firth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the national Parliament of a federation, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party is able to have this Joint Sitting because it was part of an overall <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign; it was part of a total package. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But did that <span class="highlight">election</span> really give the Government any great mandate to push ahead and change the electoral laws of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Britain, the mother of modern democracies, at the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was immediately after a redistribution, numbers ranged from 22,000 to 96,000, a difference of 400 per cent to 500 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask why senators and members really want to change the present electoral laws when the Labor Party won the last <span class="highlight">election</span> with 49.3 per cent of the vote and gained 52 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basis of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> is contained in a number of statements made by leading political figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way to determine that is by an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the government of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They were the words of the Leader of the Country Party in setting up the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  in setting up the <span class="highlight">election</span>, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite clear that the Opposition parties in both Houses of the Parliament set up the <span class="highlight">election</span> as a test for the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Looking at my own State of South Australia I find that in 1968, which I believe was the time of the first <span class="highlight">election</span> after the previous redistribution, the number of voters for the seat of Bonython was fixed at 49,000, for Kingston at 51,000 and for Wakefield at 46,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 10 March 1973, on this great electoral reformer’s boundaries the LCL could still win the seat of Frome with 8,296 electors but the seat of Mawson, which had been held since its inception by the Australian Labor Party, then had 24,639 electors, a ratio of 3 to 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should have won the 1954 <span class="highlight">election</span> on it, but it fiddled the seats so much that it lost the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said before, at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Labor Party polled 49.3 per cent of the primary vote and obtained 5 1.96 per cent of the parliamentary seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members opposite will not even get that next time because the result in the Western Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> was not good enough for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has happened to the Prime Minister’s boast during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that only Whitlam had reduced inflation by onethird? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask honourable members and honourable senators to remember what else the Labor Party said before the general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Dr Hughes,  the Liberal Party candidate in the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and the candidate in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> for the seat of Canberra, on behalf of the Liberal Party in Canberra made a submission for equality of electors in the 2 electorates in this district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He claimed that under the existing legislation the <span class="highlight">election</span> results do not reflect the will of the majority either in individual constituencies or in fact on a national basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no better refutation of that proposition than the results of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1974 general <span class="highlight">election</span> achieved an equitable result using electoral boundaries based on a 6-year-old distribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this legislation had been enacted at the time of the 1968 redistribution it would have been necessary to have a further redistribution before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further redistribution might then have been necessary before the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> in order to accommodate the changes in electoral rolls arising from the lower voting age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the adoption of this legislation would necessitate in all probability a redistribution prior to every general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been made this morning of the statement that the Australian Labor Party received only 49 per cent of the vote but 52 per cent of the seats in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the reasons why there was trouble at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all remember that throughout 1 973 and until the federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in May, the Prime Minister led the Labor Party onslaught on the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign he stomped from one end of Australia to the other emotionally appealing to voters to give Labor a majority in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet what happened in the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Determined after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1972, the Government has now become desperate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without electorates drawn in its favour the Government has no chance of winning another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had 6 redistributions between 1912 and 1968 covering 25 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May I thought the Labor Government was pretty lucky because with less than 50 per cent of the vote it got about 52 per cent of the number of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants this Bill passed so that it can rush into a redistribution which it knows can be of value for only one <span class="highlight">election</span>, with all the instability and problems that will bring upon us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why distort the entire electoral map for just one short <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government won the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and it was told to get on with the job of facing the really big issues that are concerning this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian electorate is not likely to forget, nor will it forget at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, a Government which was so determined to get legislation through to redraw boundaries in its own electoral favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today he put himself in almost the same classification as the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  in his hatred of those people whom he cannot beat in a genuine <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point has been clearly made that the wishes of the people at an <span class="highlight">election</span> should be reflected in the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the results of the <span class="highlight">election</span> were known the Labor Party found itself out of office because of that redistribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from that one redistribution, I think that in every other redistribution the <span class="highlight">election</span> results have clearly carried the people’s will. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a change of government when there has been a swing against the government and the <span class="highlight">election</span> results have been, indeed, very fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the present basis of distribution and the present system of arriving at that distribution, the ALP has won two of the last three elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think the important point, as I believe has been made earlier in the day, is that the Government faces an <span class="highlight">election</span> before that next redistribution would be through, and it wants to be able to redistribute to its own advantage before it has to face the electors again, because it knows what the situation is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could anyone suffering inflation trust it when it won an <span class="highlight">election</span> just a few months ago and promised everyone faithfully that only Whitlam and his Government would be able to save their employment, cure inflation and provide $130m for preschool care and education? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I think there is still some doubt on the Opposition benches as to who won the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, perhaps, remarkable that this statement could be made in the aftermath of an <span class="highlight">election</span> which, regrettably, we lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opposition to admit that the Liberal and Country Parties lost the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 and again at the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974 the Labor Party announced that there would be electoral reforms throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, if the Minister is successful in having this legislation approved by the Joint Sitting he will immediately look at the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> results; he will look at the electorate of Bowman and at all of those other electorates which Labor is just holding by a whisker, and he will suddenly start bolstering those electorates which need attention so that when the onslaught comes from the Australian people at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> those people who represent these electorates will have a greater chance of continuing in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will do to me what I did to him at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 1 8 May the people of this country returned the Government to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, for example, one looks at the quotas which senators have to achieve to be elected in the States of New South Wales and Victoria at a periodic half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and then looks at what would be required to elect a senator from the Territories one will have not only a remarkable admiration for the dexterity with which the one vote one value principle can be espoused and then denied by members of the Labor Party, but also a picture of how unjust the representation would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen by the Government the expenditure of money for specific purposes which, if it had been expended by an individual during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, would have exposed him to the offence- the illegal practice- of treating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have here a copy of the Melbourne ‘Age’ which was published during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and which has the headline: ‘Pledge gets Labor PS cash’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this system, these measures are then canvassed before the people in an <span class="highlight">election</span>; they will be introduced again into the House of Representatives which would go right through the gamut of examination and debate; and then they would go to the Senate where they are again examined, debated and voted on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, if there has been an <span class="highlight">election</span> before that, these matters may have been debated before the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  said that the Opposition Parties in the Senate were determined to bring down the second Whitlam Ministery which, at that time, had been in office, following its <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1972, for some 15 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the first Whitlam Ministery lasted for a month only while final <span class="highlight">election</span> returns were obtained and Party elections held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties in the Senate after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government began their course of obstruction which led finally to the calling of a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is our basic law- the Constitution- which insists that people go through this enormous time scale of effort and frustration and which provides the opportunity for people who have lost the <span class="highlight">election</span>, who have put their points of view to the people and who have had them rejected, as a government in exile, so to speak, in the Senate to say: ‘We will not accept the will of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was repealed by this Government and then in the Senate the repeal was disallowed by senators who refused to accept what the Government had said it would do and on what in part, at least in this city, it had fought an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the people had voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting, if one looks at the statistics of the probabilities of <span class="highlight">election</span>, to see that that in fact is likely to be the case having regard to the present voting pattern both in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened when this Bill was introduced after the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those arguments were proved invalid by the decisions of those who voted in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and returned the honourable member for the Northern Territory to this place as their representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Government that only  Vh  months ago at a referendum a question was put to the people of Australia which was designed to tie the elections of the Senate to elections of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet by this measure the Government proposes to tie the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the proposed senators for the 2 Territories to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All it does is to introduce 2 new elements into Australia’s present electoral procedures; that is to give 2 senators each to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and secondly, to give them a special term of office so that their <span class="highlight">election</span> would coincide with the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives and their period in office would concide with that of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present ridiculous situation is that a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> is held one year and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half of the Senate is held in the next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is bad for government and for the people who are conducting the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we believe that all senators should be elected at the same time as House of Representatives elections are held, we have written this present provision into the Bill which we hope after today will become the law of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other argument that I have located is that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territory senators would be anomalous and that they would vote according to sectional and regional interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We embarked on a course some 12 months ago-I am not trying to be provocative-to bring about the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would not go before the people in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and advocate a policy in opposition of Labor, and then because the Government got a miserable majority of 5 in one House and a minority of 2 in another, come here and desert the causes that people elected me to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I listened this morning intently to the Prime Minister, when there was a squabble about the equal division of States into electorates so as to give either a gerrymander or a just <span class="highlight">election</span>, complain in this chamber, the House of Representatives: ‘As if the House of the people should be obstructed by the Senate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But so far from contenting himself with a basis upon which to hold by-elections, which is the appropriate constitutional provision for the Senate, he provides also that every time the resignation of a Territorial senator is procured a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> shall be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we have had some experience now of a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> being achieved in the circumstances of sending  Senator Gair  to Ireland, thus achieving a political advantage for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Tasmania that at the first Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> 38,000 electors were enrolled in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the realities of the Senate: Because it is elected equally from the States, it is almost bound to be equally divided after an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He brought it into the House, never having mentioned it before, despite the fact that it was in my <span class="highlight">election</span> platform in 1966 and I had espoused it in my maiden speech in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Has he shown any interest since the May <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was scheduled to open the Travelodge motel on the Esplanade on <span class="highlight">election</span> day and he did not show up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister has not been to the Northern Territory and has not consulted with members of the Council since the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe that it is intolerable that any Australian, wherever he may live, whatever his ethnic origin or whatever his educational standard may be, should be deprived of the right to vote in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Parliament of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are initially to introduce 2 Senate representatives for each of the Territories, to elect them at House of Representatives elections and, indeed, not to count them in determining the size of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are to be senators from the States elected- the public has voted for this at Senate elections- separately, if necessary, as States and groups of States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are to be Territorial representatives elected at each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are to be Territorial representatives elected under a formula of by-elections, quite differently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought the Government went to the people to seek a mandate for a constitutional reform at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> to bring the House of Representatives and Senate elections always together compulsorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to force the twinning of the elections for Territorial representatives and the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has been put to the public has had an emphatic no- a no which has gone to the heart of these 2 Bills; a no to the methodology of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Senate territorial representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition polled so badly in this seat of government, in this place where people saw how it behaved for 23 years, that it does not give itself a chance of winning a seat in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With what nostalgic envy must members of the Labor Party look back to those heady days immediately after Labor’s <span class="highlight">election</span> to power, when its confidence knew no bounds, when the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  inordinately pleased with himself and puffed up with the sense of his own importance, was confidently proclaiming himself to be the greatest Foreign Minister Australia had ever had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They even went to the extent just before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> of drumming up rather hastily a rather vague proposition for restructuring the present system of hospital insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberals privately, in the secrecy of their committee meetings, have confessed this inequity because at page 9 of the original document which one of the Opposition members was kind enough to send to my office anonymously before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>- the document on the Opposition’s health proposals- the following remarks were made: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not start last year with the Green and White Papers or at the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> in which the subject figured so prominently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition will concede that we won the <span class="highlight">election</span>, then new members, old members, and the Australian community should concede that this Government has a mandate to proceed with the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign he said he supported the Liberal Party health scheme when, because of his membership of the General Practitioners Society, obviously he did not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of them were corrected in the hurriedly prepared Liberal Party health scheme produced just before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So they hurriedly tried to correct their scheme before an <span class="highlight">election</span> that was of their choosing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when the final draft came out, after pressures had been applied and after threats of the withdrawal of <span class="highlight">election</span> funds, this suggestion was withdrawn from the Opposition’s scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the things that have been speciously misrepresented around this country during the last 3 federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns and they are still being mouthed today by people who know that what they are saying is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the specific mandate of the electors of Australia, who returned this Government to power, following a double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span> in which this legislation was a major issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having once pushed the Australian Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span> by double dissolution, the opposition has immediately threatened to repeat its behavior. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fitzgerald report disclosures of the paltry contributions by major overseas mineral companies to Australian tax revenues, utilising the excessively generous tax concessions our predecessors allowed, were greeted with stunned silence by the Opposition during the recent May <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is conspicuous that this consultation has not taken place under a government which, prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>, preached the virtues of consultation but which in government has been subject to an apparent manic preoccupation with confrontation to a divisive extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It happened that, unbeknown to the Government, the report was ready when the last <span class="highlight">election</span> came on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> talked about an increase of $6 a barrel in the price of oil in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it had been passed on all these occasions by the House of Representatives and had been rejected by the Senate- as indeed it was rejected again by the Senate after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, and with very good reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May, whatever small majority the Government has in the House of Representatives after that <span class="highlight">election</span>, it does not have the numbers in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spent most of his time regurgitating the tired old Fitzgerald report which was conjured by the Minister for Minerals and Energy and leaked out to the Press in dribs and drabs at the beginning of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be seen from the way in which the report was leaked to the Press for days during the middle of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign how the Government tried to build up hate against investment of this type. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last 2 elections one of the major issues was who owns Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was particularly in evidence in the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 1 8 May last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been forced into a Joint Sitting because of the stubbornness of the people on my left who decided that they did not lose the last <span class="highlight">election</span> even if they did not win it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  stood here today with crocodile tears coming from his eyes because he made that great bloomer during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when he virtually promised the oil companies: ‘Return our Parties and we will increase the price of oil per barrel as it comes from the wellhead.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite amazed- despite all the things I have heard of  Senator Keeffe-  that he is capable of devoting an entire address on an important occasion such as this to an attempt to absolutely mutilatewhat a futile operation that would be- the character of the Premier of the State which annihilated the Labor Party at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If anyone says that what I was saying is untrue he should look at the results of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Australian Labor Government to the treasury bench in this Parliament there was precious huie, if any, application of the community interest to policy making in this enormously important mining sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further in reply to the honourable senator, let me say that a concerted campaign was launched against me by one of the feature writers of the Melbourne ‘Age’ shortly after the recent double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span> and prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> by the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party of the new Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some cynics in my Party have suggested that I put him up to it in order that I might be helped in topping the poll for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators to the Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, despite all that, when 2 Houses of Parliament rose for the <span class="highlight">election</span> the work of the Committee was largely concluded; a draft report was practically ready. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span> we came back to be met by 2 new Bills which took up a great number of the issues raised by the Committee when examining witnesses and which also took up quite a number of areas of concern about which people had spoken in the Committee and to the Committee in public hearings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that we had a double dissolution and an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign which interfered - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  who decided the date on which the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The presentation of this legislation represents the outcome of an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise made by the Prime <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  prior to the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have said that this legislation is the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise the implementation of which was delayed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> intervened, and the new Government is not prepared to take any action whatever to give effect to those proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a completely new approach, but undoubtedly the Government has, by its <span class="highlight">election</span> victories, the right to govern and the right to put forward this type of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is proper that with the indulgence of the Senate I should record my strong feeling of appreciation at my <span class="highlight">election</span> as a member of this House of the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am rather surprised that I should have to debate a Bill of this nature in this House, considering the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> Press publicity gained by members of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Sydney Morning Herald’ of 1 May, 17 days prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Federal Opposition spokesman on legal matters,  Senator Greenwood,  who unfortunately is not in the chamber at the moment, was reported as saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A State government may prefer to look after the big business interests which support it before an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition parties issued a Press release, unfortunately with no date on it, but it would be pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> because it says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say from the discussion that has taken place this afternoon that it is quite evident that the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises of the Opposition, or those on the Opposition benches, were never meant or never designed to give protective legislation to the consumers of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I think that I can well and truly say that unlike the Liberal Party, which at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> undertook, if elected to office, to abolish the Department of the Media, whilst there is a Labor government in office there certainly will always be a Department of the Media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by informing the Minister that during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign a  Mrs Jean  Leu of Sydney received an anti-Labor communication in an official PMG envelope. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister cause an immediate investigation to be made in an effort to ascertain how official departmental stationery was used as part of the Liberal Party <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740814_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government was returned to the Australian Parliament on 2 occasions- and on the second occasion we did not seek the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Bill is part of the Government’s development plan as stated in its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises, we cannot see the possibility of the Government accepting an amendment which allows the States to decide where the Australian Government will carry out its development policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740815_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware that during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, among other <span class="highlight">election</span> promises, the Government undertook to provide finance to the South Australian Government for the purpose of filtering the Adelaide water supply at a cost, I believe, of something like $80m? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall refer the honourable senator’s question to my colleague the Minister for Health and ask him to take whatever appropriate action he needs to take in order to achieve the objectives which the Government outlined before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, of course, another spin-off- a thing which surely must be agitating the minds of people in local government- is the very serious question of the lack of interest in local government elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I saw recently in Tasmania an <span class="highlight">election</span> where, I think, fewer than 100 people were sufficiently interested in what was happening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740816_senate_29_s61/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister realise that, unless Tasmania receives some special consideration by way of a special subsidy to equalise Tasmanian freight rates with those that exist between States connected by road and rail as was promised by  Mr Whitlam  during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, Tasmanian industries could well sink under these continual freight increases, with a consequent detrimental effect on the Government’s decentralisation aims and a worsening of our already bad unemployment situation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think there has been a distortion of the statement made by the Prime Minister during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740917_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Furthermore, the recognition was done,  Mr President,  in breach of a clear undertaking contained in a letter written before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> by the Prime Minister to the  President  of the Council of the Lithuanian Community in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What an extraordinary thing it was that the day before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> the Prime Minister of Australia wrote to the  President  of the Council of the Lithuanian Community denying that there would be any de jure recognition and indicating that the policy would be as in the past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On the day before the elections, conscious of the importance of the migrant vote- and many times before that- the Prime Minister said: ‘We will not recognise the incorporation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has changed since the day before the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government and this Minister have broken an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was bitterly clear to the Australian people, and this must be faced, that at the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 18 May the Government had given its word that there would be no de jure recognition of the incorporation of those states in Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to explain the situation that occurs in relation to these elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of the  President  of the General Assembly is dictated by the convention that each year the major geographical groupings of the United Nations members take turns in choosing from amongst themselves an agreed candidate for the presidency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that it would be better for the honourable senator to wait and see what happens and to try to assist the Government to get a system of voting which will be better than the system we all had to endure during the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot afford to go through all that nonsense again and have 73 people standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate in New South Wales alone, the conspicuous feature of this situation being that the overwhelming vote was for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that elections are to be held during October 1974 for the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nominations for this <span class="highlight">election</span> close this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory (Administration) Act provides that a person is not qualified to be a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> as a member of the Legislative Assembly if, at the date of nomination, he is employed in the Australian Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Northern Territory could be denied the incentive for or opportunity of standing for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present there is no specific provision enabling a public servant who resigns to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Northern Territory to be re-appointed or re-employed in the Public Service if he fails to be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to enable officers or employees of the Australian Public Service and members of the defence force, who resign to contest elections for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, to be re-appointed or reemployed if they fail to gain <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person who retired from the Public Service to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory may, if he fails to be elected, be reappointed or re-employed at his previous level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is also made to enable the sections to be applied by regulation to elections for legislative or advisory bodies of other Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments made to the Superannuation Act by Part III of the Bill will extend to these candidates the same superannuation rights and privileges as presently apply to Australian Government employees who resign to contest Federal or State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I understand that the <span class="highlight">election</span> result is not a reflection of the opinion of the majority of people in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any event, it was a very low poll and the <span class="highlight">election</span> was directed towards local government issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Baume  seeks somehow to extend what happened in a local government <span class="highlight">election</span> with a very poor poll to the attitudes to the Australian Government, I think he would on reflection find that his prediction was a very improper and unscientific- even politically unscientificmethod of analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a union executive surely this must be a realistic way of contributing to the democracy of the union system in Australia and to more successful relationships between employer and employee alike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the form of <span class="highlight">election</span> which is satisfactory for the Australian people to elect their government- at this stage an Australian Labor Party Government- should be an excellent and indeed necessary form by which to elect whether a union is to amalgamate with another union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that there would be no objection from a Labor Party which believes in compulsory voting in all parliamentary elections and which, I understand, believes in compulsory voting in local government elections and will force people to vote and fine them if they do not, to the application of that principle to the union movement which in many ways is more powerful in this country than the Government itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one method that can be democratically used is to apply the same voting procedures to major union decisions as apply to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have not been added to very much by the new senators who came into the Senate after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and they certainly would not convince anybody that there ought not to be a change in the existing provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unions believe that they should have a right to determine the affairs of their own union, including the conduct of a ballot, the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers and any other issues which affect only members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hall suggested that voting in a trade union ballot for amalgamation was similar to voting in a Federal or State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Australian Labor Party supported compulsory voting in elections for State and Federal Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voting in State and Federal elections, where it is compulsory under the Commonwealth Electoral Act to be registered on the electoral roll, to have one’s name, address and occupation on that roll, is quite different from voting in an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the trade union movement where it is not compulsory to join a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in my belief it was irrelevant for  Senator Hall  to refer to the fact that the Australian Labor Party supports compulsory voting in elections for parliamentary office and the imposition of a fine on those who do not vote, when he suggested that it should be compulsory for members to vote in a trade union ballot for amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that the Liberal Party is quite right in suggesting that secret ballots ought to be held for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We inserted section 133 (1) (a) in the legislation providing that members themselves must vote in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said more than once and it ought to be said again that public statements were made before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and by the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  that we considered these measures to be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The roll available for the <span class="highlight">election</span> was finalised in December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is now nearly the end of 1974 and those concerned are no nearer perfecting a roll to provide for that <span class="highlight">election</span> than the Registrar was when he first decided who should be on the roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the people who would vote in a current <span class="highlight">election</span> would not be in the industry anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, it cannot be assumed that those who do not vote in an <span class="highlight">election</span> concerned with an amalgamation motion oppose the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the second of the 2 Conciliation and Arbitration Bills which the Government introduced into the House of Representatives shortly after the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This theme was constantly reiterated in those months leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Bill had its genesis in 1973 when a government, flush with an <span class="highlight">election</span> victory, was still expounding the policies which had helped to win it an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, both the Country Party and the Democratic Labor Party were represented by quite a number of senators in this place, in addition to which the Democratic Labor Party in its own right polled a significant number of votes at the previous Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the Austraiian Labor Party received approximately the same number of first preference votes at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> after the double dissolution of the Parliament as the Liberal Party and the Country Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Douglas McClelland- But  Senator Drake-Brockman  did not come in as a member of the Australian Country Party last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we might have a declaration as to which of those 2 men honourable senators opposite voted for as their leader after the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because, since  Senator Townley  ‘s first <span class="highlight">election</span> over 2 years ago and his representation in this chamber over that period, he has proclaimed that he is an Independent when everyone knows that he never was an Independent, that he is not an Independent and that he is never likely to be an Independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740924_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implementation of the recommendations has been delayed by the double dissolution and the general <span class="highlight">election</span> this year, but the complex planning required in determining priorities for the establishment of new radio stations is now under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does seem unreasonable that members of the Northern Territory Public Service and the Commonwealth Public Service should not be able to resign from their positions to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span> and, if they are unsuccessful, to rejoin the Public Service and continue with the same rights as they had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability on the part of Commonwealth public servants to do that with regard to elections for the Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament has always been recognised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the position with regard to the members of the Northern Territory Public Service has been acknowledged by an amendment to the Northern Territory Ordinance establishing the Northern Territory Public Service some 10 years ago so that members of that service are entitled to resign, contest an <span class="highlight">election</span> and, if they are unsuccessful, to come back into the Northern Territory Public Service with no loss of continuity or of rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the expression ‘tidying up’ is a fair way to describe what will happen with regard to members of the Commonwealth Public Service who are interested in standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> as candidates in the forthcoming Legislative Assembly elections in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Commonwealth Public Service have to resign in order to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Houses of this Commonwealth Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can, if they are unsuccessful at the <span class="highlight">election</span>, rejoin the Public Service after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the Australian Capital Territory, according to the information which has come to me, there has never been any prohibition upon members of the Commonwealth Public Service standing as candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> as members of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council, and that there will not be any prohibition upon them standing as candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> as members of the proposed Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I understand that some public servants are candidates in the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, nominations for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly close on Friday, and it is desired that the Bill should pass through this chamber today, go through the House of Representatives and, if possible, receive royal assent on Thursday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If adequate provision is not made it must be conceded that someone may, through inadvertence or by some change in attitude to these things, depart from the principle that we are accepting and by some kind of ordinance in a territory take away the right of public servants or those in the defence forces to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> and to be reinstated if they are unsuccessful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad that  Senator Young  has raised this point because I have some personal knowledge of Government interference in Wheat Board affairs which pre-dates 1 973 and in fact pre-dates the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stated that in fact quite early in 1 972 a directive had been issued to the Board by the then Liberal-Country Party Government not to trade with the Chilean Government following the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Marxist  President  Allende. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There could not have been an <span class="highlight">election</span> in that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not hear any details from the Australian Labor Party in the 1972 and 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns about the imposition of its capital gains tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Labor Party entered the 1972 and 1974 Federal elections and talked about social justice it did not reveal the hidden realities that the Australian people would have to contribute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not say that because it knew very well that if it went into an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign espousing that sort of policy it would lose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not hear a statement like that in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since I have been a member of the Senate I have heard it said many times- I have not attempted to count them- on the other side that we on this side should be reminded that we did not win the 1972 and 1974 Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I never doubted that we lost the 1972 and 1974 Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think the Federal Labor Government needs to be reminded that the Australian Labor Party did not win the State Government <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland in May 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not win the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not win the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span> in November 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed neither did it win the Western Australian state <span class="highlight">election</span> in March 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following those actions of the Government in 1973 in relation to tariffs and revaluation, we had in 1974 the May <span class="highlight">election</span> which was brought about by the refusal of supply to the elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even though  Mr Snedden  has been constantly talking about the economy since the May <span class="highlight">election</span>, he so far has displayed little evidence that he has the intellectual and political toughness to take the decisions which the deteriorating situation demands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the people of Australia are becoming suspicious of rhetoric and clever debating, and that in the next <span class="highlight">election</span> there will be a more realistic assessment of what is being offered to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At <span class="highlight">election</span> time, we, the Opposition, campaigned on the need for Government restraint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate of Bill Snedden ‘s caution before the May <span class="highlight">election</span> and his refusal to promise increases in social programs until inflation was brought under control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that in the recent Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> there were secession candidates in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control from its inception until the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, I have been very much involved in its work at all stages, and in particular in the reference made to it by the Senate of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill and the National Investment Fund Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then had the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I see it, the only interpretation that is compatible with the facts is that in the second week- that is after the <span class="highlight">election</span>- the Commission dropped its reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once again a likely interpretation seems to be that the Commission was trying to oblige the Liberal- Country Party Government in the week before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> by enabling it to claim that the establishment of the Commission was a remarkable success because in the first week of its operations it had forced prices up by 10 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span>, when there was no necessity to do that, prices were allowed to fall to the previous level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740926_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was reminded the other night that during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Snedden  said that interest rates would  have  to go up, before they would come down, even if his Party were elected to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator also will recall that during the recent Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the Prime Minister announced that a Labor Government, upon being returned to office, would do all it could to provide a third network for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants to spread <span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda about grants, let it deliver when the time comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the 1972 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was being fought- nowhere was it fought more bitterly than Townsville- the Labor candidate and the then Labor Leader,  Mr Whitlam,  made it clear that if Labor were elected to office it would immediately provide funds for the construction of stage 2 of the Ross River dam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sad that so much time has passed since that <span class="highlight">election</span> before the commencement of stage 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the scrutiny given by the media and by the people and organisations that support our <span class="highlight">election</span> to Parliament are sufficient to ensure that we act honourably and uprightly, as I believe all honourable members do in respect of their pecuniary interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Daly  and other Labor Ministers said that the multi-national corporations were contributing to the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A subject I know more about concerns the accounts run up during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign which were paid by other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a document which was sent out during the May 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign by the Leader of his Party, and it lists quite a number of people who made large donations to his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would just like to comment briefly on the Government’s much publicised national health scheme which was mentioned so much during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and which was the subject of one of the double dissolution Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was greatly distressed when I heard that the Liberals were moving to a harder line in this way, especially in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of their Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pleased to read reports that they had moved away from that hard line and disciplinarian attitude in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of their Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was introduced a few days before the 1973 State <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia as a very great developmental project put together by the State Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the South Australian House of Assembly met earlier this year I was able to ask the South Australian Premier to produce the report which he said he had before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and which gave the all clear on the environment in Spencer Gulf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that the South Australian Premier had it all clear before the last State <span class="highlight">election</span>, but now there is to be a full public inquiry by the Commonwealth Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will remember that during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in South Australia the Premier came out with a very enthusiastic plan which had been worked out in co-operation with  Mr Hawke  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions under which the ACTU was to buy from the South Australian Government a large amount of land south of Adelaide and develop it for homes for the workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That plan formed pan of a dramatic <span class="highlight">election</span> platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span>  Mr Hawke-  the Minister must know this- said that he liked Sydney better and that he was not going to do this in Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was all right to say this during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in South Australia, but afterwards  Mr Hawke  got a bit tired of it and said that he would go to Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember formulating a policy for water filtration for the 1970 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we were defeated at the <span class="highlight">election</span> and were unable to put into action the water filtration plan for Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the 1972 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> at which Labor came to office  Mr Dunstan  was the  Chairman  of the Australian Labor Party Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> Finance Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Chairman  of that Committee he worked rather assiduously to obtain funds for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek your financial support for the ALP campaign for the Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Federal Labor Government will save you these costs in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promise of the Labor Party and of the Premier of South Australia prior to the December 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> has therefore cost the industry, by the imposition of a Federal excise in their place, an extra $ 1 3,729,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that was unfortunate, because if we read all the statements that have been made by our economic spokesmen and if we read the policies that we put forward during the May <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, we very quickly recognise that we have some alternative proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Considering that the Government is reaping a reward in excess of $3,000m in personal taxation, one would have thought that even the Labor Government would have recognised that it could afford to grant in excess of the $600m reduction in personal income tax that  Mr Snedden  promised during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Dunstan  made the great announcement that there would be a $300m petro-chemical works established in that area of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in March  Dr Eastick  said at Murray Bridge that Monarto would be an economic sink. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr McLeay  was trying to say that the South Australian Labor Government advocated Monarto only as a public relations exercise when, if these words are correct, that is what his Government was trying to do prior to the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that it becomes a member from a far distant State which has the protection of the most democratic system of State elections in the whole of Australia to object to a reference to an area about which he knows nothing and which has the worst gerrymander system in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  successor won one <span class="highlight">election</span>, lost the 2 following elections and then left the Party for the whole purpose of coming to this place to criticise his colleagues from South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will remember that when his leader, during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, was asked which areas he would cut out, he found it very difficult to say anything, except to suggest cuts in expenditure on health, education and the other services which no selfrespecting government would cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it wants such a mandate, let us have an <span class="highlight">election</span> with that as the basis of the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We contested an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He told the people before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the Government had taken certain action and that inflation had fallen by one-third. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the campaign leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 18 May, together with other members of the Liberal Senate team, I visited many factories in Tasmania and, without exception, each time the management were asked a question on shipping they gave the same answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Senate we have had the privilege of listening to all 15 new honourable senators who grace this chamber as a result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held because of the double dissolution of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, and quite importantly to Tasmania, as was proved at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> by the reaction of the electors, Tasmania is under seige because of the harm done to rural industries in under 2 years by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A little later in the statement he rightly reminded the electors of Tasmania about the promises made by Labor before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The electors of Tasmania could become very important in the next federal elections as 5 seats will be coming up for the taking by the Opposition parties from members now representing them who have grown old and lazy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Government stands condemned of the most flagrant breaches of its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises to equalise the rates for Tasmanian freight with those applicable to those on the mainland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is more loathsome and pitiable because of an advertisement which appeared prior to the 1 8 May 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> as a result of the double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Barnard,  the member for Bass, authorised in the week prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> an advertisement which stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Long before I knew I would use this advertisement in the Budget debate and before the <span class="highlight">election</span> was held I had written in my own fair hand on this advertisement which was authorised by  Mr Barnard,  ‘Snedden and Anthony threaten our job’, because I thought and hoped that the Liberal and Country Parties would come back into power on 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The strange thing is that despite the criticism of honourable senators opposite, during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign they never promised that anything more would be spent on defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst their defence spokesman and others in this chamber criticised the Government before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and whilst they have come back here and said that we ought to do certain things, none of them has promised to spend anything more on defence because they know that we are managing the defence Services properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just to drive it home, he came back in the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> and promised something else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 5 May, a couple of weeks before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, when addressing a convention he had this to say, and he was talking about inflation: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Prime Minister callously and cynically betrayed the Baltic people in repudiation of an undertaking that he gave on the eve of the general <span class="highlight">election</span> on 17 May, so he has equally callously and cynically betrayed the Australian people by his repudiation of promises and undertakings that he gave during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in May he told the Australian people that inflation had been reduced and was no longer a problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A newcomer to this chamber,  Senator Button  gave us some enlightenment- no doubt it was an early pre-selection speech for the Victorian when he said, according to a report in Tuesday’s ‘Australian’, that industrial unrest, power struggles and militancy now being experienced in Australia are healthy signs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Dunstan,  the Premier of South Australia, as  chairman  of the Australian Labor Party Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> Finance Committee, wrote to producers of wine and brandy in South Australia seeking funds for his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is consistent with an undertaking given by the Prime Minister in 1 972 during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and restated in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measure of the interest that the Liberal Party had in Tasmania is that its members were hardly ever seen, except at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Everett  said,  Mr Whitlam  and other Ministers travelled to Tasmania frequently before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and they have travelled there frequently since the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In September 1972, before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, we were assured by the then Minister for Education and Science and by  Senator Rae  that the removal of the Antarctic Division to Tasmania was impossible and undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the year following the <span class="highlight">election</span> this Government after investigation found that it was indeed possible and desirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are criticised for putting that to the national Parliament when dealing with a Bill to which it should be attached and Government senators do not vote for it, they are saying: ‘We heard the promise of the Prime Minister at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Late in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when I was gaining some confidence, and recognising the dangers of a politician’s making any promises, I said at Whyalla that when I was elected to the House of Representatives I would ensure that a railway line was constructed from Port Augusta to Whyalla. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that the Government then was trying to arrange a satisfactory agreement for all sorts of reasons, and the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> could well have been one of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In this regard I simply want to place something on record with all deference to members of the Government who made this matter a feature of their 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Problems, of which Moore v Doyle and other cases provide illustrations, arise from the fact that a State branch of a federal union and a State union are often administered as if they were the same body, with one set of books, one register of members, one membership fee, one set of officers, one <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers for both bodies and one system of meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, elections conducted for a State branch of a Federal union may be conducted under the rules of the State union and not under rules of the branch or partly under the rules of the State union and partly under the Federal union’s rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741017_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I think it is fair to say that the trade union movement in general around Australia worked very hard to have a Labor Government elected in 1972 and again worked very hard to have that Government stay in power in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in May this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>- whenever it comes- the trade union movement in general again will work very hard to have the Labor Government re-elected, as it will be, because again that will be to the advantage of the members of the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an interesting sidelight possibly on the attitudes which parties take that the desire to use the processes of the Constitutional Convention for the promotion of a further referendum on this subject of widening the industrial power of the Commonwealth was expressed as part of the Opposition Parties’ platform at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it is worth while at this stage, in case there are some doubts as to what the problem is, to point out that it is adequately and fairly stated in the second reading of the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop),  as Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration, where he points out that over the years, because we have this dichotomy in our industrial law, situations arose so that a State branch of a Federal union and a State union often were administered as if they were the same body, with one set of books, one register of members, one membership fee, one set of officers, one <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers for both bodies and one system of meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After years and years of litigation in which I succeeded in obtaining legal victory in the courts and  Senator Murphy’s  clients remained in control of the union because they ducked from the State body to the Federal body, my client finally won an <span class="highlight">election</span> and went down to take his place in the union office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he also seen a statement by  Mr Sinclair  that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign an agricultural chemical company was asked to contribute funds to the Australian Labor Party’s campaign, with the implication that if a donation was not forthcoming then, to quote  Mr Sinclair,  some ill might befall that company’s continued participation in the agricultural community’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the many claims made by the Australian Labor Party in seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> to government and early in government was that it disapproved strongly of the principle of the previous government in substantial leasing or renting of premises and that its policy would be to alter that arrangement radically and to provide accommodation in its own buildings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741112_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that following Labor’s success in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 there was a commission formed in the western suburbs of Melbourne in which prominent Labor Party personalities were involved and it was established with a view to promoting what was said by the Labor Government and by some of its Ministers to be the needs of the western suburbs of Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should be clearly understood that the present Western Australian Government made it clear, when in Opposition, that if it were returned to government at the next State <span class="highlight">election</span> it would appoint a royal commission to ascertain whether the interests of Western Australia would be best served by the introduction of a second service at this stage in Western Australia’s development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741119_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-As I think all honourable senators would be aware- 1 hope they would be aware- and certainly all war widows would be aware, there was a steady deterioration in the level of the pensions available for war widows after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal-Country Party government in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without going any further into this question of taxation concessions and all the other imposts which the Whitlam Government was alleged to have placed on farmers in the 1973 Budget, the final test of the sincerity not only of the Country Party but also of the entire Opposition was demonstrated quite decisively in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in May 1974 when, despite having fulminated for the previous 8 months about the alleged injustice and the alleged unwisdom of these policy decisions, the Liberal and Country Parties gave no undertaking to reverse any of these policies, with the exception of the superphosphate bounty; and even then that undertaking was carefully qualified by the statement that the bounty would be extended for 3 years and referred to the Industries Assistance Commission for study. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest very strongly, though, that it is highly deceptive, to say the least, to grandstand in the countryside and say how necessary particular taxation concessions and rates of depreciation are, or are alleged to be, and then, when there is an opportunity of offering an alternative policy in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, to give no undertaking to provide some real backing for the empty rhetoric that the Country Party had been throwing around the electorate for the previous 8 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told the story by  Mr Whitlam  during the 18 May <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Government had collared inflation which was then on the down trend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>But it is rather serious when the Government of the day comes out at <span class="highlight">election</span> time and says that it has collared inflation, that it is going down, when it is really rising at a very rapid rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why, the Labor Party, during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, engaged an overseas-owned multi-national advertising company to do its advertising so it would get back into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is more interesting than anything else is that the Labor Party still owed the foreign-owned multinational company $200,000 for the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741120_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span>; retitling of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several of the more significant proposals contained in this Bill are intended, either in whole or in part, to enable the final result of a federal <span class="highlight">election</span> to be known more speedily than has been possible hitherto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One such proposal relates to the introduction of optional preferential marking of ballot papers, which will result in a speedier count for Senate elections in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing preferential system, each voter, irrespective of his individual wishes in the matter, is compelled to rank in order of preference all the candidates on the ballot paper, whether this requires the marking of only two squares or, as was the case in the most recent Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales, no less than 73. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As senators will appreciate, the present system involves intolerable delays in finalising the <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This practice presents many obstacles to any attempt to speed the count, especially for Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, under the proportional representation system used for the Senate, the quota for an <span class="highlight">election</span> cannot be determined, nor can the count commence, until the exact number of formal votes cast is known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the recent Senate elections, the precise number of formal votes was unknown until over 2 weeks after polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government is particularly anxious to prevent unscrupulous persons taking advantage of aged or infirm electors, it is also proposed to prohibit the inspection of postal vote applications for the purpose of listing of names of persons who applied for postal votes at an <span class="highlight">election</span>, except where such listing is genuinely required in connection with an inquiry into possible malpractices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under a proposed provision, the only postal vote application forms which may be used at an <span class="highlight">election</span> will be those specified or declared to be applicable by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal is designed to curb the current dubious practice of having thousands of postal vote applications completed months in advance of the next ensuing <span class="highlight">election</span>, then forwarding these to electors at or about the time of the issue of writs, without any precise knowledge as to whether the persons concerned are, in fact, entitled to vote by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of recognition as a political party under these amendments, it is proposed that a party must have candidates officially nominated for not less than one-fourth of the vacancies to be filled at the relevant <span class="highlight">election</span>, except in the case of an <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill a casual Senate vacancy or a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these cases, a party must have had candidates officially nominated at the immediately preceding Senate or House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, in accordance with the formula specified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one case, a person successfully enrolled as ‘HBerrill (Surname) Stop Asian Immigration Now’ (other names) and was a candidate in that name at the recent South Australian Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Bill a person may be nominated for <span class="highlight">election</span> only in the name under which he is enrolled or, if he is not enrolled, in the name under which he is entitled to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now turn to another important area awaiting reform, one which has been highlighted by the most recent elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is hoped that the new deposit requirements will keep this proliferation of candidates within reasonable proportions, without going so far as to deprive serious intending candidates of their legitimate democratic right to present themselves for <span class="highlight">election</span> to public office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The earlier closing of the poll will permit an earlier indication on polling night of the possible result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> and it will also ease the burden a little on the thousands of poll workers without, I believe, inconveniencing the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, just as it has been considered appropriate in the past for a member of a State legislature to be ineligible to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Australian Parliament, so the Government considers that it should be made quite clear that a member of the legislature of an internal Territory is likewise ineligible to nominate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision is also made in this Bill to prevent a person from becoming a candidate for two or more federal elections held on the same day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the 1 969 elections, a person stood as a candidate for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia, as well as for the House of Representatives in the Division of Hindmarsh. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some concern has been expressed in the past at the possibility of a candidate assuming the name of, say, a sitting member, primarily for the purpose of gaining some political advantage at an <span class="highlight">election</span> and thereby causing confusion in the minds of electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Bill was first introduced in the House of Representatives in April this year before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, copies were provided to the then Northern Territory Legislative Council for its information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of insufficient time and the complexity of the inquiry the Committee was not able to advise the Government on electoral matters in time for the conduct of the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Committee, after its own investigations, endorses the changes made by the Government for those elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that if his Party on our side of politics wants to do something useful it might come out with some very firm unequivocal statement of what it is going to do about secret ballots for strike decisions and about the implementation of parliamentary disciplines in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1) Which person appointed since December 1972 from outside the Australian Public Service to Boards, Commissions and Statutory Authorities under the Minister’s responsibility arc members of the Australian Labor Party or who, prior to the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>, publicly advocated the return of a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ) to (5) I refer the honourable senator to the Prime Minister’s statement on 23 August 1974 (House of Representatives Hansard p. 1213) where he referred to the fact that the government does not know in each case what occupations were followed by Australian Labor Party candidates after the 1972 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This position also applies in respect of people who advocated the return of the Labor Government before that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741126_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-82-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, due to unforeseen delays brought about by the <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1974, the Bill has been held over until now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That conference had to be cancelled because of the decision then to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> following the double dissolution of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal was first publicised in 1973 as part of the <span class="highlight">election</span> program of the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember clearly how I questioned  Mr Dunstan  during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign as to what protection there would be of the environment of Spencer Gulf, especially in relation to the prawn industry, which is based on a very delicate environmental factor in those waters, and of course other factors of general pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier’s reply during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was that he had a report from the Department of Fisheries which gave the all clear to any possibility of the pollution of Spencer Gulf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I may say that the Premier, when asked after the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1973 to table the report in the House of Assembly in South Australia, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I leave the environmental factor I wish to remind the House that the Premier said in April before the 1973 <span class="highlight">election</span> that the environmental question had been cleared; yet in May 1974, over one year later, a report of his own Government- of course, a report obtained under the pressure of politics in my State- under the heading of Effluents’, in part of a very large report of the South Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, said that little information is yet available on the nature and quantities of plant effluents and noise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Government says that the postal voting system must be reformed merely to speed up the count on <span class="highlight">election</span> night, one cannot help but think: ‘It that the real reason for the proposed change? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the results of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives- this proposed system is to apply to both Houses- showed that the average number of candidates for each electorate was four which meant that an elector had to fill in only three out of the 4 squares to have a valid vote because, as we all know but do not tell electors, they do not have to fill in the last square. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, in the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives this year the informal vote was only 1.92 percent of the total votes cast throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, since 1900 the percentage of informal votes for House of Representatives elections has hardly moved, up or down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the Government’s argument on informal votes for House of Representatives elections, I do not think that has much validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to Senate elections, if one uses the argument that optional preferential voting will reduce the percentage of informal votes, I do not know how the Government can attempt to substantiate it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What one must do is look at the informal votes cast in Australia because, after all, we are talking about a Bill for an Act which will affect all electors in Australia in elections for the whole of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the informal vote at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate was 10.77 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1948 the Labor Government introduced a Bill to provide for the application of proportional representation to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Bill to have proportional representation for Senate elections was introduced in 1948, the AttorneyGeneral of the day,  Dr Evatt,  in his second reading speech, was critical of any proposal to make voting optional. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the parliamentary <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales in 1922 and 1925, the exhausted votes, which far outnumber the informal votes, were the cause of much dissatisfaction and disputation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we examine the table we find that optional preferential voting in Advisory Council elections was introduced in 1959. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the table all <span class="highlight">election</span> figures for 1949 to 1957 are complete preferential voting figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have carefully stayed away from the question whether we should have optional preferential voting in elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that more than anyone alse in Australia, perhaps with the exception of  Mr Westerway,  I had reason to understand the argument that the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> result was slow after the 18 May <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took 5 weeks to the day before we knew the result of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only possible reasons for introducing this is to help the returning officers to get a quick result on <span class="highlight">election</span> night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People of that faith have to wait until an hour or half an hour before the polls close, and then there is a great rush on the polling places because that is the only time on <span class="highlight">election</span> day when they are permitted under our law to cast their own vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I cannot understand why the Opposition adopts this attitude since the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in great controversy about the effect of very long papers on which very many voting details were required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Party that has not formed a view of how to handle Senate voting procedures since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1 8 May is not capable of governing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, my Party in South Australia had very serious talks with the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in South Australia on the basis of misconduct we believe occurred in electoral voting in the division of Boothby which is now represented by  Mr John  McLeay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party was very dissatisfied indeed with the ethics or lack of ethics exhibited by the South Australian Liberal Party in that division at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of that name may have been a rather humorous way of livening an <span class="highlight">election</span>, but it did not really add to the seriousness of the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A system of preferential voting for Senate elections is, I think, something to which practically all political leaders have subscribed since the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I remember one Country Party leader in particular who had a detailed plan to overcome this problem, and it seems that the Government has met it pretty well in its proposals in relation to preferential voting in Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is possible, of course, that there happens to be a State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and that my beloved friend, the Premier, with whom I converse regularly- I will not refer to him religiously tonight; he has over the last few weeks done a lot to lose that title- would adopt this sort of tinny gimmick which he would think would probably gather votes for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741128_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think, if the honourable senator casts his mind back to the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>, he will remember that two of the matters upon which the Labor Government fought the <span class="highlight">election</span> were inflation and rising unemployment- both brought about as a direct result of the Budget introduced by the then Treasurer,  Mr Snedden,  in August 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the cut in the Queensland program caused by technical reasons, or was the deletion of the segment brought about because of political pressure applied to the Australian Broadcasting Commission by the Premier of Queensland, the Honourable J.

    <p>I preface it by reminding the Minister that a Colin James Bennett, barrister, former Labor alderman, former Labor MLA and former member of the Australian Labor Party, is now the National Party candidate for the seat of Kurilpa in the forthcoming Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s decision to adopt the major recommendations of the working party was first announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech on 29 April 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the year about which  Senator Carrick  speaks the Bill concerning the National Urban and Regional Development Authority was regarded as an interim piece of legislation and was introduced some 6 weeks before the Parliament was dissolved for the purpose of fighting the 1972 general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If there was any truth in that the Prime Minister had plenty of time to make inquiries about the state of the economy because throughout the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign before 18 May he was continually told about the need to reduce taxation and that the fight was about inflation, but he would not listen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was on it was interesting to note the 2 themes adopted by the Labor Party in its advertisements, and this was particularly noticeable in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that because of that when the <span class="highlight">election</span> in that State takes place on Saturday the people will give the answer to show that they like strength in leadership and government and I hope that it will also be the answer to this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, any thoughts in that direction must be cut short because of the particularly bad judgment which was shown by the Opposition in forcing an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At end of motion, add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the provisions of the Bill which reduce the limit on deductions for education expenses from $400 to $150 seriously restrict the freedom of choice which now exists in the Australian education system, are a contravention of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> undertakings and will impose unwarranted burdens on parents with children attending both public and private schools and, further, that the Bill specifically: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My assessment, based on my judgment and political sense, and it was expressed at that time, was that after another 9 to 12 months- that is from December to Marchwould be a better time to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Had these electorates been distributed in a way which was compatible with democracy- honourable senators will recall the great declarations by the Supreme Court of the United States of America that an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the people means that there must be equal electoratesthe coalition would have gained 52 seats and the Australian Labor Party 30 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know of no reason for this other than the fact that in the Queensland elections these people would have voted for the Labor Party or perhaps assisted the Labor Party in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why were 16 or 18 people needed to surround one black man’s house on Friday of last week, the day before the Queensland <span class="highlight">election</span>, in a spirit of intimidation, bulldozing them off the island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Senator Cavanagh)  was replying in the second reading debate he mentioned something about this having been an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue and that now that it was not an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue we could treat it possibly in a different manner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will go out and I will be pleased to tell the electorate that this is what  Senator McLaren  believes in and that any re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of him or any <span class="highlight">election</span> of his colleagues in the Lower House will mean a continuation of the stranglehold which the Australian Labor Party now has on the States and their governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They put the Australian Labor Party first every time, before the good of their own State, so much so that they went to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1970 promising that 2 dams would be built on the River Murray in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then new South Australian Government in 1970-71 denied any dams to South Australia and stated, following that <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, that it would re-negotiate the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But in South Australia the State Labor Government was advised before the 1968 <span class="highlight">election</span> that it would have to change its policy on the Chowilla Dam and promote the Dartmouth Dam because of new information that was to be introduced to it very shortly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spoke to the candidate there and he told me that perhaps the significance of and the reason for that was that very great care had been taken to explain the Federal policies to the people of that area and when they understood what the Federal policies were they stood by the Labor Party in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think one of the most shameful things in this country’s recent history- and there have been a lot of shameful things perpetrated by this Government- has been the dishonest statements which were made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1974 and so carefully repudiated within a week of Labor returning to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding  Sir Charles  Court’s assertion that inflation could be beaten State by State, what has happened since he has been elected is that the consumer price index for Western Australia, which at the time of his <span class="highlight">election</span> in March 1974 stood at the national average, has rocketed to 58 per cent above the Australian average. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been a strong feature of the Labor Party, as it was during the May <span class="highlight">election</span> and has been over the last couple of days, that it would dearly like the responsibility of writing a policy for us which would undoubtedly keep us in Opposition forever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1 972 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Labor Party sold the line that this meant doing nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the place of a  Senator becomes  vacant before the expiration of his term of service, the House of Parliament of the State for which he was chosen shall, sitting and voting together, choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor as hereinafter provided, whichever first happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to give expression to this principle, it is necessary that in the filling of a casual vacancy, the representation of the parties should remain a reflection of the votes cast for those parties at the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My opinion is that, in view of the fact that proportional representation is now the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate, a member of the same party, nominated by the executive of the party, should be appointed when future vacancies arise through death or other causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the present period of proportional representation for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators, such a choice could be sufficient to deprive a government of its majority in the Senate.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The idea that a State government of itself should be able to nominate whomsoever it chooses cuts across the pattern established for the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> of members to the Australian Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales the Labor movement secured a majority of votes over and above the Liberal-Country Party candidates in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and it is only 7 months ago that the people of New South Wales expressed that point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least we will have an expression from the Senate, in part, that there ought to be an observance by the New South Wales Government of the convention which has been adhered to since the proportional representation system for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Senate originated in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition said that to vote for a party ticket in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is a denigration of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why are we so backward on our side in politics in upholding the principle ofthe democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> of members to Parliament and of this convention which is to continue it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the members of the sub-committee take the trouble to read the commentary by Quick and Garran on section 16 of the Constitution they will learn, if they do not already know, that even before any question of proportional representation was involved in <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate the procedure for filling a casual vacancy under section 1 5 of the Constitution was regarded- this is supported by the convention debates- as an extremely temporary measure until either the expiration of the term of office of the vacating senator or the next House of Representatives or Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative selection is only operative until the expiration of the term or the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor, whichever first happens; it: is merely an ad interim appointment, in order to save the State from being short of a senator, on the one hand, and to save the State the cost of a special <span class="highlight">election</span>, on the other: the legislative  apppointee  is not a successor of the deceased, disqualified, or resigned, senator, but merely a temporary holder of office, pending the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor by the people ofthe State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the introduction of proportional representation in 1 949, the States have demonstrated their readiness to choose a new  Senator ofthe  same political party as was the  Senator he  replaces at the time of his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the founding fathers reserved to the parliaments of the States the right to make laws for determining the times and places of elections of senators for the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Realising that there can be no division of boundaries for senators for purposes of rigging the electorates or divisions, that power in regard to the places and times of elections is not unimportant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They reserved to the Governor of the State the right and authority to issue the writs for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principle of proportional representation was applied to any full <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It stated that, if the place of a senator became vacant before the expiration of his term, then the Houses of Parliament of the State would, sitting and voting together, choose a person to hold the place for a temporary term until there was another <span class="highlight">election</span> which would give the opportunity for his successor to be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term of the person coming in to fill the casual vacancy is temporary, ad hoc or interim until there is another <span class="highlight">election</span> giving the opportunity for that person to be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the defects of proportional representation and the transfer of votes from the original papers is that if there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974 and the casual vacancy occurs in 1975 a great deal of change in the political judgment of the electors may have occurred in that interval. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if it is found that the Constitution is in line with the general theme that the Senate is a body in which the States have a particular interest and that the Constitution prescribes that the members of both Houses of the State Parliament sitting together shall fill a casual vacancy, it can be seen that it may be that a decision by the people’s representatives in the State Parliament would be a more appropriate interpretation of the will ofthe people in February 1975 than a transfer of votes from an <span class="highlight">election</span> held in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most satisfactory way to ensure this result, the Committee considered, was by a provision in the law that any votes credited to an ex-senator be transferred to the next in line according to his ballot papers and the candidate elected by a continuation of the count would serve until the expiration of the term or until the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, whichever should first occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second thing, as the Committee noted, is that it is not outside the scope of experience that a vacating senator might join another party after his original <span class="highlight">election</span> and before the vacancy occurs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose that no Queensland <span class="highlight">election</span> was in contemplation at the time the Gair affair arose and an ambassadorship was offered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that they must believe that when they vote at an <span class="highlight">election</span> to choose their representatives in Parliament they are taking effective action and an action which will retain its effect for the term for which they have voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second requirement of law and order in a democracy is that the people should be assured that when they vote at an <span class="highlight">election</span> their vote has some meaning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Owing to the requirements of the Constitution an <span class="highlight">election</span> has to be held before the balance of the departing senator’s term has been completed by his successor, and this throws the alignment of the Senate out of adjustment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was honoured last year by the Australian Labor Party Government in Western Australia when  Senator Prowse  resigned from the Senate when an <span class="highlight">election</span> appeared to be in the offing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is he not seeing his whole term out and allowing a new candidate to stand at the <span class="highlight">election</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are going to depart from the principles which govern a parliamentary democracy and make enough people think that, though they voted in an <span class="highlight">election</span> and elected a party to govern, that is really meaningless and all sorts of steps can be taken to abort what they have tried to do with that vote, those people who are already dissatisfied because of economic circumstances and do not like the economic system will also have a contempt for the political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a matter of interesting conjecture as to what my chance of <span class="highlight">election</span> would have been if there had not been a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They did their sums on <span class="highlight">election</span> percentages and they decided that if there were 6 vacancies in Queensland the numbers might have come up right for them on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Included in the Bill are provisions which require the appointment of party agents by political parties and the registration thereof by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer; require the maintenance of a Register of Party Agents by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer; require lists of all party agents and official agents to be kept in electoral offices in each State and Territory; require the filing of returns relating to electoral expenditure by registered party agents and official agents with the Chief Australian Electoral Officer within 12 weeks after an <span class="highlight">election</span>; require returns to be open for public inspection; require the certification of returns by a registered company auditor; enable the reimbursement of auditor’s fees up to a limit of $200; prohibit electoral expenditure by any person except a registered party agent or official agent, without prior written authority of the respective agent; prohibit the making of gifts, including donations, to a party or candidate except with the written authority of the registered party agent or the official agent of the candidate; require the disclosure in returns of particulars of gifts, including donations, made to political parties or candidates, through or with the authority of party agents or official agents, but excluding any gift of less than $ 1 00, and gifts by any one person aggregating less than $100, made during the period to which the return relates; and limit the campaign expenditure of a political party, including electoral expenditure by party’s candidates in accordance with a specified formula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the formula the limit of expenditure of a political party in a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>- held separately from a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- - would be based on 7.5c for every person enrolled for the division or divisions contested; that is to say, an amount of $593,740 on present enrolment for a party contesting all 127 electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> held alone, the permissable expenditure of a political party would be substantially less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be based on 1.5c for every person enrolled for the State or States contested by the party; that is to say, an amount of $1 16,578 on present enrolment for a party contesting the Senate elections in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a senator the proposed limit is an amount of 0.2c for every elector enrolled for the State concerned, or $3,000, whichever is the greater. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an <span class="highlight">election</span> of a member of the House of Representatives, the proposed limit is an amount equal to 5c for every elector enrolled for the division contested; that is to say, $3,250 in respect of a division comprising 65 000 electors, or $2,500 in respect of a division comprising 50 000 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The existing law stipulates that electoral expenditure by a candidate may not exceed $500 in a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, or $1,000 in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The expenditure by political parties and candidates at the 1974 Senate and House of Representatives elections for broadcasting and televising time on commercial stations alone was in the nature of $ 1.5 m and in this connection I quote from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board ‘s Twenty-sixth Annual Report on its operations during the year ended 30 June 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total time occupied by broadcasting of political matter on commercial broadcasting stations during the <span class="highlight">election</span> period amounted to 683 hours 45 minutes and the charges for that time were $3 16,739. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The total time occupied by telecasts of political matter on commercial television stations and charges during the <span class="highlight">election</span> period amounted to 196 hours and $1,334,680 respectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In several overseas countries the burden of the cost of broadcasting and televising is partly met from the public purse and it is intended that the Government will give some consideration to this aspect before the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statements in question were that there was a long history of government interference in wheat marketing and that the previous government had interfered in the Australian Wheat Board’s sales to Chile following the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  President  Allende. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My sources of information regarding Government directives to the Wheat Board on sales to Chile after  President  Allende ‘s <span class="highlight">election</span> was the Australian Broadcasting Commission’s radio program ‘Country Hour’ broadcast by an official of the Western Australian Farmers Union on 3 1 October 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal of the rotation of senators will be preserved at each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>; be it at the normal 3 year interval or sooner, there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are: Firstly; in the event of a double dissolution, the normal term of a senator can be cut short, as is the case now; secondly, the terms of existing senators will be changed to provide for short term senators, who would normally retire on 30 June 1976, to have their terms extended until the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, which would normally be held in 1977, and long term senators, who would normally retire on 30 June 1979, to have their terms extended to the second House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, which would normally be held in 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus existing senators, subject of course to there not being an earlier double dissolution or an earlier House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, would have effective terms of approximately 3 years in the case of present short term senators and 6 years in the case of the existing long term senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives were held simultaneously on only two of those occasions- in December 1961 and in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In between, there were 4 separate elections for the House of Representatives and three for the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia may have had fewer governments than some other advanced countries but it certainly has had more elections than any. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr President,  it has been estimated by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer that the holding of simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and half the Senate could result in savings of up to approximately 90 per cent on the cost of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> held separately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intention of the men who drafted our Constitution and the expectation of those who voted for it was that every 3 years there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives and half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No supervening principle has emerged in favour of multiplying and separating elections for the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one way in which simultaneous elections of the Senate and the House of Representatives can be assured at all times and that is by the constitutional amendment that is proposed in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It decided to call an <span class="highlight">election</span> for 19 seats at a time before the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory could finish its hearing and present a report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having set out to give the Territory self-government, having beaten the gun by deciding how many electorates there would be and then suffering a mighty defeat at the <span class="highlight">election</span>, this Government is now using the Bill in an effort to criticise and to detract from the ability, sincerity and effectiveness of present members of the Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at proposed new section 147 relating to the fines to be imposed where breaches of the Act occur, and to the limits to be set for expedition in respect of parties for the Senate or House of Representatives elections or for referenda, these can be seen only as being arbitrary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all very well for honourable senators on the Government side to snigger but the ridiculous situation will arise of people putting up dummy candidates just to be able to fund the operation in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, they are used for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes and for electioneering expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any sitting member in this Parliament, no matter in which House he is, is campaigning from the day he is elected until the day his <span class="highlight">election</span> comes again and that gives him an enormous advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Nobody in this place is naive enough to believe that a government does not campaign from the date of its <span class="highlight">election</span> to the date of the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we talk about equality and equity between incumbents and challengers, surely if we are to be fair the moment an <span class="highlight">election</span> is over and a challenger announces himself he should be given the same salary, rights and privileges as the incumbent so he can challenge the incumbent at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The experience of the Electoral Office has been that in spite of the fact that there have been penalties for not putting in after an <span class="highlight">election</span> electoral returns as to one’s expenses the Electoral Office has not prosecuted either a successful or unsuccessful candidate for not putting in that return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Politics being what they are, my educated guess would be that the party which won the <span class="highlight">election</span> would make quite certain that its members who breached the law were not prosecuted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So much for the objections to parties and to the suggestion that in some vague way or in some totally nebulous way the Bill will restrict the number of parties which can contest elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The quibbling was about minor points such as whether the amount allowed should be 7.5c, 6.5c or 3.5c for specified elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions state that a candidate for the House of Representatives may not spend or may not have spent on his behalf more than $500 in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and that a candidate for the Senate may not spend more than $1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Moreover, did  Senator Withers  or any other upholder of law and order who sits on the Opposition benches ever suggest that action be taken against those candidates for the Senate or the House of Representatives who flagrantly violated those provisions <span class="highlight">election</span> after <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A great volume of tourists or a great volume of residents in Australia who are perhaps not naturalised are counted as a basis for holding an <span class="highlight">election</span> if it will bring some advantage to the Australian Labor Party and disadvantage to other political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not say that they will always latch on to any party, but during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign there was the infamous incident involving one of the dregs of the advertising agencies,  Mr Singleton,  who I know embarrassed the Opposition parties with some of his tactics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me say this: The only occasion on which an <span class="highlight">election</span> result was upset due to inefficient electoral operations by the Chief Electoral Officer was in a Coogee byelection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was a byelection in Coogee and it did happen again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we lose an <span class="highlight">election</span> I never think that the result is crooked; but I know that there can be inefficiency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With reference to electoral inefficiency, I remember an incident that occurred during the last New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that in the 1972 and 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns there were people- without naming the television channel involved- who would have liked to have gone much further than they went. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a politician seeking re-<span class="highlight">election</span>, and if he is fearful of defending his record in open debate, he doesn’t deserve to be reelected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A national <span class="highlight">election</span> is little more than a joke if one candidate is able to pour twice as much money as his opponent into paid television time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Our goal must be public financing of all federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, we should achieve public financing of presidential elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it proves successful, as I believe it would, we would move on to public financing of House and Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>An incumbent  President,  be he Nixon in 1972 or Johnson in 1964, holds an all but overwhelming advantage when he can start planning and organising his campaign a year or more in advance, while his challenger cannot really finalise planning until he is nominated, perhaps three or four months before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously a  President,  in one sense, is always campaigning, but it would be possible to restrict the kind of political activity that the Committee for the Re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of the  President  started on Nixon ‘s behalf early in 1 97 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proposed new sections 153b and 153c create the positions of party agents and official agents and require these persons to do many onerous things including the making of returns after an <span class="highlight">election</span> showing all the donations that may have been made in the flurry of the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government may decide that this is a good time for a further increase to be made and, with prior knoweldge of a pending increase, take great electoral advantage of that provision when an <span class="highlight">election</span> comes near. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition it is significant that in 1972 the United States Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> Campaign Act became law and it provided, among other things, for disclosure of all contributions in excess of $100. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, it must also be noted that under the Tillman Act of 1907, the Smith-Connolly Act of 1943 and the Taft-Hartley Act of 1 947 restrictions were placed on national banks and labour unions in respect of making contributions in elections for federal office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a Parliament concerned with the effectiveness of our <span class="highlight">election</span> system, we should look at the whole of the problem and not seize one or two aspects which seem to be of interest to our own Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that if Tom Jones or Bill Smith down the road wants to stand as a candidate in an <span class="highlight">election</span> and he knows the amount of money he is allowed to spend, as people do under the law at the moment although the law is being violated, he would be more likely to stand because he knew he could afford to or could raise the required amount of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing Act he is entitled to spend $500 on his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign but he has no compunction whatsoever about spending $40,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that the Australian elector is entitled to know is how much money is spent by political candidates and political parties on elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had an exercise forced on us by the Opposition in May last year and we had to say to the Australian people: ‘We are now being forced to spend an awful lot of the taxpayers money, your money, on holding another <span class="highlight">election</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I understand that the cost of an <span class="highlight">election</span> is in excess of $4.5m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could stand here and say- as  Senator Missen  did- that the party agents and official agents following an <span class="highlight">election</span> have to fill in returns to state from where the funds have been received and where they have been expended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a quite unwarranted <span class="highlight">election</span> which still has not been paid for by the Australian taxpayers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, at the present time there is a limit of $1,000 in the case of a candidate for Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and $500 in the case of a candidate for House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>; that is, the present limit on a Senate candidate is double that which existed in 1902, while the present limit on a House of Representatives candidate is 2% times the limit that was set in 1902. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The information provided to me by my instructing officers, representing the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  is that the answer would depend on the particular facts of the case, but if the expenditure was made for the purpose of promoting or opposing, directly or indirectly, a party or candidate or influencing an <span class="highlight">election</span> directly or indirectly, then such expenditure would be deemed to be electoral expenditure within the meaning of the proposed legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution never intended that the Senate should automatically face an <span class="highlight">election</span> when the House of Representatives faced an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, because of certain circumstances, the pattern has developed of the 2 Houses going to an <span class="highlight">election</span> together but there is nothing in the Constitution to indicate that the 2 Houses must go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question about it-  Mr Whitlam  ‘s idea of bringing this type of legislation forward is to frighten senators who may vote on some occasion to bring about a double dissolution of the Parliament that their terms of office will expire at the time the House of Representatives faces such an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the House of Representatives is brought to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in a period shorter than the period of 3 years for which it was elected, of what concern is that to the Senate, the constitutional chamber of this Parliament of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if some honourable senators have 3 years of their term still to serve under normal circumstances, I cannot see the necessity for legislation to make it mandatory for them to face an <span class="highlight">election</span> with the members of the House of Representatives, apart from the circumstances which arise in a double dissolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was envisaged in the creation of the Senate that there would be 2 sets of 3 year terms for senators with half the Senate members standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the back of the minds of the writers of the Constitution was the idea that while the membership of the House of Representatives could change at each <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Senate still carried a reflection of the thought prevailing for 3 years before the <span class="highlight">election</span> so there would not be a complete change in the outlook of the Senate as there would be in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the position is considered in that way, it makes it more clear in my mind that it was in the minds of the writers of the Constitution that there should be sufficient period of time between the <span class="highlight">election</span> of each half of the Senate so that there could be a carry-over of opinion, not for just 12 months but for 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances, I think that we should do all we possibly can to preserve the Senate as it is at present, and that the Senate should retain its independence in not going to <span class="highlight">election</span> always with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite definitely that if there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country today this Government would be landslided out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this circumstance it must constantly reflect the very often emotional circumstances of an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the introduction of simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate must most definitely deny Australians that most important province whereby the Senate is a responsible House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally important, I believe, that the Senate elections should occur not simultaneously with the House of Representatives but that they should occur as they do now and produce half the members of the Senate at any one <span class="highlight">election</span>, so that there is a change not of the total Senate but of half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is much simpler to hold elections conjointly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the self evident reasons for synchronising elections in the House of Representatives and the Senate, ever since May last year there has been another particularly compelling reason why this should be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If elections are not synchronised and if the Government does not have the qualifications to force a double dissolution, having had Bills twice rejected by the Senate, the Senate can reject a Supply Bill and force the House of Representatives and the Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span> without exposing itself to the verdict of the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over and beyond that- I am sure that privately members of the Opposition would acknowledge thisthe circumstances which existed at the time of the May 1974 elections and referendums were such that the electorate was overwhelmingly involved in the question of the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the survival, the return or the defeat of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious- the point does not need labouring- that if we have an <span class="highlight">election</span> every year, which seems to be the pattern our opponents are trying to establish, we do not achieve greater stability in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to those who argue that stability is achieved in some way by having more and more elections is to turn logic upside down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I forbear from taking up  Senator Wright’s  invitation to refer to the debacle which hit the Minister’s Party when it contested the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 3 October I asked a number of questions relating to the use of the Commonwealth Police during the 1 974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am surprised at  Senator Wright’s  moral indignation on the matter because at the worst we can be accused of nothing more than larceny by finding whereas  Senator Wright  belongs to a party which at the May 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> could be accused quite openly larceny by stealing Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clients for whom I acted won the <span class="highlight">election</span> and the man who had been elected in this ballot as secretary of the union turned up in the union office to occupy his office and was told by the defeated secretary: ‘Yes, you can have a seat over there in that corner of the office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assets belong to the trade union registered in New South Wales, of which I am still the secretary because there was not an <span class="highlight">election</span> for that position but only for the position of secretary of the branch of the federal organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is the view of the Government that it may following an <span class="highlight">election</span> find itself in a position to put a mass, a stockpile, of Bills before such a Joint Sitting, then in fact the Australian people would be witnessing a total reversal of the social and political history of this country at one fell swoop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let me impress upon those who wish to record what has happened here tonight that what the Opposition is doing is not judging the Bill upon its value or its contents but merely judging it as a means by which it can frustrate the Government and force it if possible to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition is so confident that it can win an <span class="highlight">election</span>- and I do not think Opposition members are; I have a feeling that things have changed somewhat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we have moved away from an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the Opposition seek to discredit and to frustrate the Government and to force it to an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-If Senator Webster is going to bring up the argument that the Opposition did not deny Supply last year and did not cause an <span class="highlight">election</span>, it is no wonder his side of the House is turning this debate completely upside down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that 2 months ago they and their supporters would have said that they could not lose an <span class="highlight">election</span> caused by a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They lost the <span class="highlight">election</span> and, incidentally, would not accept the verdict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of them forcing an <span class="highlight">election</span> when they ought not to have done so they were taken to a Joint Sitting by the Labor Party and all those things which their supporters detested so much came into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are doing this without any certainty of winning an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am prepared to table extracts from the ‘Argus’ on various dates in 1933 which point up very dramatically that  Sir Robert  Gordon Menzies, then  Mr Robert  Gordon Menzies, Q.C., was prepared to do the same thing as honourable senators opposite are now doing and as their  Deputy  Leader tried to do in 1974 during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign following the double dissolution when he was advocating protection of multi-national foreign interests, which was not in the best interests of Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government was elected in 1 972 and one aspect of its <span class="highlight">election</span> platform was to protect the mineral resources of this country for the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing much is said about the proposals which were nervously unwrapped prior to the May 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> and afterwards put back on the shelf like an unwanted wedding present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing is said about those matters now because that was just a try-on for the purpose of the May <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has available to it now, as of this moment, the grounds for a double dissolution and it is an entirely competent for the Government, not the Opposition, to bring on an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The facts are that  Mr Whitlam  has the grounds now for a double dissolution and if he called an <span class="highlight">election</span>, as well he might- I suppose were it not for this morning’s unedifying events in another place- and if defeated the Labor Party could leave this country in a very serious situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bills to introduce this scheme were forced through the Joint Sitting with the help of the 4 Labor senators from Queensland who had been given a clear indication in the May 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> that the people of Queensland did not want the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This indication was reinforced in the Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They know that, come <span class="highlight">election</span> time, money, literature and a public relations man will be supplied to their parties by the voluntary health funds and that these will be supplied from moneys that have been contributed by innocent people who thought they were putting all their money into insuring against their health needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year we foreshadowed that we have it in mind to do this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, the committee of the union has decided that it does not want to amalgamate in the way for which a small section of the union has been agitating, and one would suppose that the committee decision ought to prevail because, if the committee members have not the confidence of their union rank and file, there is a periodic <span class="highlight">election</span> at which that policy can be changed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no need for the employer organisations I referred to have a ballot of every one of their shareholders any more than it is a necessity for everyone to vote in a local government <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have been pleased since to notice that  Mr Laurie  Short has gone further and suggested some sort of triennial, formally fixed elections for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt that suggestion has merit, although one could think of defects involved in being so formal in relation to fixing times at particular periods for such elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was shown in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The will of the majority of the members of the Senate is expressed by the majority vote which was accorded to senators in the Opposition ranks over the vote accorded to senators in the Government ranks at the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Government and to the Minister that if they really wish to improve rank and file consultation and rank and file view of union matters they should provide for compulsory secret ballots in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials and require that those elections of union officials should take place at regular periods, say every second or every third year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seemed to me that he was saying that regardless of who wins an <span class="highlight">election</span> the Senate Opposition will please itself about the matters upon which the Government went to the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But for political reasons, I imagine, mainly because the Government is desperate to find <span class="highlight">election</span> issues to save its own hide, the Government did not allow that Senate Committee to report but introduced the Bills again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government was prepared to delay the legislation for 12 months, and for 2 years if necessary, so that it could make a political point and store something away for a future <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government was more concerned with putting something else on the stockpile for a future <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very fitting that it should do so on a day when a  former  Prime Minister,  Mr John  Gorton, who took such a hand in forming the Corporation has announced that he will not be coming back to this Parliament after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was subsequently repeated during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign following the double dissolution in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750304_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span> a portfolio for the A.C.T. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in September 1974 and the new institution designated a Legislative Assembly, although it had no legislative functions, has been meeting and conducting business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It in fact gives statutory authority to the Australian Council for the Arts, which has been operating since February 1973, together with 7 boards devoted to particular art forms, lt fulfils an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Prime Minster  (Mr Whitlam ) and the Government made in November 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When referring to the possibility of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Australia the article stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that so long as the Government acceptedly remains the patron of the arts it must play a significant role in appointments to these boards, and it is probably not possible to devise a system of <span class="highlight">election</span> of some members of the boards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the chairmen of the Boards is important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of policy which this Government has pursued since its <span class="highlight">election</span> and, I trust, will pursue in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Trotskyists organised and have been readmitted to the Young Labor Association, and, at the last Young Labor Association conference, secured the <span class="highlight">election</span> of almost half the executive of the Young Labor Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ought not the public to know that the group which fought so well to be readmitted is, within months of readmission, planning to contest seats against the Australian Labor Party at any <span class="highlight">election</span> which is held in 1975? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the heading of  Senator Greenwood’s  amendment I want to refer particularly to the recent statements on Medibank and the proposals which have been put forward and then denied concerning a possible <span class="highlight">election</span> upon the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has led to very strong conjecture that we will have an <span class="highlight">election</span> possibly in June and certainly no later than July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the weekend,  Mr Anthony  said there would be an earlier Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> over Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When do you think the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every citizen of this country is faced with this conundrum: Will there be an <span class="highlight">election</span> by July? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue for Australians is that they do not know what health scheme they will have, they do not know whether they will have an <span class="highlight">election</span> and they do not know who will lead the Liberal Party to any supposed <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows he is pushing for an <span class="highlight">election</span> to save it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows that  Mr Anthony  is pushing for an <span class="highlight">election</span> to put off a redistribution of boundaries in the Australian scene. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice today that  Mr Anthony  had a letter placed in the ‘Australian Financial Review’ saying that he had not threatened an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>… No words attributed to me in that report in any way support your claim that lam trying to precipitate an early <span class="highlight">election</span> over Medibank, or I am threatening people over this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not threatening an <span class="highlight">election</span>; he is just saying that if the Medibank funds are included in the Bill it will be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But he is not threatening an <span class="highlight">election</span>; not at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Opposition parties forced an <span class="highlight">election</span> which created the ensuing Joint Sitting which gave the Australian Labor Party the full endorsement of its health plans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Opposition denies the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Joint Sitting it created and takes to the absurd scene and length this denial of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that the Opposition is threatening in words through  Mr Anthony  to precipitate an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the Australian people which the public does not want about a scheme which the Opposition does not then want to make the central theme of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has already said that Medibank, whilst it would be a major part of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, would not be the central theme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am saying that  Mr Anthony  definitely is threatening the Australian people with an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is politically committed to a State <span class="highlight">election</span> within 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much has been said by the previous  speaker, Senator Steele  Hall, at least in the early part of his contribution, which took my running, as the saying is, in relation to the performance of the Opposition and its constant threat and harassment of the Government over the possibility of a snap <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We embarked on a course 12 months ago- I am not trying to be provocative- to bring about a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving out the words which  Senator Withers  interpolated, what he was saying in the Senate was: ‘We’- meaning the Opposition- ‘embarked on a course some 12 months ago to bring about a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also surprised me that he should have indicated that he felt it was a strange and even rude circumstance that when  Mr Snedden  was asked when he proposed to force an <span class="highlight">election</span>- and who knows who forces an <span class="highlight">election</span>, whether there is to be one and whoever may force it- he did not reply, did not give a date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I assume that such an astute Premier as  Senator Hall  once was would certainly not have indicated to anybody- to the Press or anybody else- when he may have chosen to set a date for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been misrepresented in that I have been quite wrongly reported as threatening to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been misrepresented as threatening to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> over this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I have said is that the Government itself will be responsible for the precipitation of an <span class="highlight">election</span> if it deliberately and consciously adopts a course of action when it is fully aware of what would seem to be the likely consequences of that course of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To complete my explanation I point out that I have made it clear that the Government can avoid precipitating an <span class="highlight">election</span> over this matter by following the proper course of introducing a separate Bill to appropriate funds for Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that that was a somewhat generous assumption because to me it seems that the Governments governs- whether there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> or not- on a 3-monthly cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of legislation to establish a commission such as the one provided for in the Bill was promised in the policy speech of the Australian Labor Party prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it was included in the policy speech which was presented by the Prime Minister before we successfully fought the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the present Government came a new approach to Australia’s railway problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we must never forget that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns in 1972 and 1969 contributions towards the cost of printing and propaganda were made to the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, during the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign one of the large voluntary health funds supplied free of charge a public relations officer from its staff to work for the Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can recall the mystifying leak of the Opposition ‘s proposals on health before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I return to the point that either the Opposition has an emotional attachment or allegiance, as  Senator Button  puts it, to the voluntary health funds, or the Opposition is afraid of what will happen to the source of supply of propagandathe provision of people and printing- in future <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon his <span class="highlight">election</span> the new leader said that his policy would be against frustration of legislation in the Senate and that the Government would not be forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the withholding of Supply or the throwing out of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was a very good judge of the political climate at the time because the gallup poll last weekend showed that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held the Government would be returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 7 quarters since December 1972, 262 000 dwellings have been built compared with 255 000 dwellings in the 7 quarters preceding the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Last year-  Senator McAuliffe  will be well aware of the details of this- some Federal Government Ministers saw fit to say in Queensland during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign before the State <span class="highlight">election</span> that the problems that the Queensland Government claimed it had in relation to housing were entirely its own, and that the State Government had not managed to spend the money that the Federal Government had given it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On what occasions and to what persons during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign for the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span> on 1 8 May 1974 did any member of (a) the Commonwealth Police Force and (b) the Attorney-General’s Department request the withdrawal of an <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement or the insertion of an apology or correction, in respect of that advertisement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-60-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a reported decision of the Government of Papua New Guinea to postpone the scheduled 1976 <span class="highlight">election</span> for one year, which in effect would postpone Independence Day? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government of Papua New Guinea have the power to unilaterally change the year of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, or would this require amending an Australian Act of Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The current legislation governing the holding of elections in Papua New Guinea is the Papua New Guinea Act 1949-1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provides for the High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea to direct at any time the holding of a general <span class="highlight">election</span> but that general elections shall be held at intervals not exceeding four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-63-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The promise of open government- a promise that it thought would win votes- has proved as phoney as its other <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the question of elections for the people of Vietnam was a burning issue-  the assumption that the Viet-Minh would not agree to free elections could well be erroneous despite the consistent Communist rejection of <span class="highlight">election</span> proposals for the unification of Germany, Austria and Korea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Senator Sim  is prepared to open his mind and his eyes and become intelligent he will find that former  President  Eisenhower in his memoirs said that if there had been an <span class="highlight">election</span> at the time when the Geneva Agreement was signed the forces of Ho Chi Minh who was a communist and a popular liberation leader, would have won 80 per cent of the popular support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because time is catching up, I turn very briefly to allegations that the United States of America and South Vietnam violated the Geneva Accords by rejecting free elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does he seriously suggest that in North Vietnam political parties from South Vietnam would be free to operate an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the major issue involved is that from 1954 to 1956, a period when the Prime Minister and this Government claim there should have been free elections, the North Vietnamese were engaged in a pleasant little game of land reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why does the Labor Party today deny that to the people of South Vietnam who in every <span class="highlight">election</span> have always voted strongly against communism, as they are voting today on their feet? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elections have been observed, and there have been observations by members of the Labor Party who have all reported that in the circumstances they have been as free as could be reasonably expected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is probably why, in the last Queensland <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Labor Party won only 1 1 seats out of 84 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there had been a redistribution in Queensland before that <span class="highlight">election</span>, as the Labor Party wished, and there had been equal numbers representing a cross section of the people, the Labor Party would not have got any seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Certainly the Opposition is not threatening the Government with an <span class="highlight">election</span> now unless the Government has something up its sleeve which will arouse great concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have stated- I stated it in the campaign which preceded the 1 8 May <span class="highlight">election</span>- that to my mind it was a disgrace that this legislation should have been delayed for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stated then- I tried to make it an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue- that we could delay no longer, that it was necessary for the Liberal Party to declare itself and that it was necessary for it in its policy statement to declare that it was in favour of and would introduce this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That writ is still in force, in spite of my offer to  Senator Rae  that if he felt aggrieved by the statement which I made as part of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I was prepared - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was found to be so most glaringly in the United States at the height of the Great Depression when  President  Roosevelt’s Administration, after its <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1932, determined that at least part- certainly not all but at least part and a significant part- of the great distress which had afflicted the United States during the Great Depression had been caused not by problems in the economy, in the narrow sense of the economy, but by malpractices, defects in the stock exchanges of the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact that did not happen until after the report was prepared and printed in April 1 974 and then because of the <span class="highlight">election</span> it was not able to be presented until July 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1972 the reconstituted Committee found itself operating in a completely different situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750410_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting the qualification of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed <span class="highlight">election</span> to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, taken overall, the proposals in this Bill are intended to allow for a speedier finalisation of federal <span class="highlight">election</span> results and to improve voting facilities for electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Third, it proposes consequential amendments of the Senate Elections Act 1903-1948, the Senate Elections Act 1966 and the Representation Act 1903-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that every politically minded person has the right to form, if he can attract support, a political party, and the right to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span>, either singly or in a group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thousands who did vote this way would probably have their vote not counted because it would not reach their Divisional Returning Officer on the night of the <span class="highlight">election</span> which is the new cut-off time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently the Government believes the average person cannot number a ballot paper from one to four- the demand made on more than 90 per cent of voters at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government might, perhaps, point to the 1974 Senate ballot paper in New South Wales, where 73 candidates stood for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The informal vote in New South Wales at that <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1 974 was no higher than it was in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> of 196 1 when there were only 2 1 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The informal vote for Senate elections has always been higher than it has been for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optional preferential voting was used in Senate elections in the 1 920s, and the informal vote was no lower than it is today with the present full preferential voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A change to an optional preferential system would make counting no easier for either Senate or House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another example of the Government’s determination to deprive small parties and individuals of their right to be elected is contained in its proposals to lift the deposits for Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But imagine the effect on an individual or a small group of people who wish to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would be forced to make a major financial sacrifice for the right to seek <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will mean, in effect, that anyone who does not cast his vote on the Thursday before an <span class="highlight">election</span> will be disfranchised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the specious excuse of avoiding delays in counting <span class="highlight">election</span> results, the Government would insist that all postal votes be received by the close of the poll if they are to be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are few occasions when counting of postal votes materially delays the outcome of an <span class="highlight">election</span>; but if it does, surely these votes are vital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be proposing that for each <span class="highlight">election</span> a different coloured postal vote form be used, ensuring no party can store up forms and then solicit votes with these forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often in the past the very fact that the names of political parties did not appear opposite candidates’ names had been used to confuse voters and to upset the proper <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain small groups that appear at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, and usually only at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, come forward from time to time with how-to-vote cards that suggest that if you are a Labor voter you should vote for that Party’s candidate first and then follow the Labor Party ticket or if you are a Liberal voter you should vote for that Party’s candidate and then follow the Liberal card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that there are in some areas amongst some of the smaller political professionals standing for Parliament, not because they ever expect to get there but because of the name they had or assumed in any <span class="highlight">election</span> meant that they were placed at the top of the ticket and they picked up the donkey vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe this applies so much to the major political parties because they usually pick their candidates because of pressure of support for that person within the party and because of the value of the contribution that person will make to the Parliament, but for many of the smaller parties that mushroom up at <span class="highlight">election</span> time this was their moment of glory, their little grab for power, to be king maker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are very many people in the community who in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> rebel against having to rate the candidates- all the candidates- in an order of preference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has been pointed out before, we had the extraordinary situation in New South Wales during the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> where 73 candidates had to be rated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person did not understand our system in the first place it was an almost impossible job to explain how to apply it in that particular <span class="highlight">election</span> with that number of candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senate elections are notorious for confusing voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless a person starts at one end of the ballot paper- it can be a long ballot paper as the last <span class="highlight">election</span> for this place showed- and just runs through the sequence of numbers, the person can become very confused as to whether he has filled in all the squares. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> less than one year ago, 5 1 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives were gained by the Australian Labor Party with 49 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> on that same occasion 47 per cent of the vote gained for the Australian Labor Party 29 of the 60 seats in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">election</span> only last May the Australian people were confronted with 4 referenda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why then is that system not suitable for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Government of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I believe it is necessary that we leave that alone and that we should leave it to the responsibility and capacity of the Australian electors and the political parties which form themselves from time to time to make sure that those who believe in particular philosophies are aware of the candidates who represent those philosophies and of the order of preference they should follow in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postal voting, it is suggested in this Bill, should be such that no votes will be counted that are not received by the closing of the polls on the Saturday, if that be the day of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there was one characteristic of the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span>, it was the crescendo of criticism within a week of the <span class="highlight">election</span> results urging extensive reforms in our electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that I may have misunderstood what  Senator Scott  said, but I defy any Opposition  Senator to  wander about his State when there are 74 or more candidates in a senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and not discover that for every person who gets his kicks in life by voting for candidates numbered 1 to 100, there are a lot of people who want short cuts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers  referred to the fact that in a number of electorates only two to four candidates contest an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a national <span class="highlight">election</span>, whether it is for the Senate which represents 6 States, or for the House of Representatives, where there are over 120 seats, a Party can win seats although fielding only 15 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that after an <span class="highlight">election</span> when one goes into hotels, clubs, golf courses or on to the beach, people chiack one and say: ‘Fancy having to vote for 74 bloody candidates’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the question of the cut-off time for votes after an <span class="highlight">election</span>, if there is to be some malpractice or some honest misunderstanding with regard to the votes in transit, that will certainly happen in those 10 days after an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the present Prime Minister had jumped the gun in the 10 days after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> honourable senators opposite would have claimed that he was presuming that he was Prime Minister when he was not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I had to make a choice between an efficient system in which I knew who was to be the Prime Minister at midnight on <span class="highlight">election</span> night, and one under which I had to wait 10 days to know the result, by which time all sorts of things could happen, I know the decision I would make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has taken the course of saying that the deposits of candidates in elections are not enough, and I agree with that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, I think that the decision to require a deposit of $1,000 by a candidate in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is unreasonable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to say that 48 candidates in Victoria and 73 candidates in New South Wales stood for the Senate at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and that this number should be cut down, but at the same time there is the important principle that individuals should have the right to put their names down as electors seeking the support of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This method is not used in State elections and I can see one difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a new system is introduced for one House of one Parliament and it is not used in the State parliaments there is room for confusion when people vote in a State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the purpose is to allow a speedier finalisation of Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> results, which I think everyone would want to see. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been associated with elections for a long while and, in fact, many years ago in my former occupation one of the many interesting things I used to do was to act as an assistant returning officer at times of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is acknowledged all around Australia, and surely those of us who have contested elections or been involved at the polling booth or in some official capacity on <span class="highlight">election</span> day will have heard comments made time and time again by the electors regarding some aspects of the electoral laws that required them to do things they did not want to do or that added a complexity or difficulty to the voting procedures that they would have preferred not to have had to encounter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to observe that with the foreshortened procedures of voting at an <span class="highlight">election</span> nobody has claimed that has in any sense altered the ultimate outcome, the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we can reduce the number of candidates for whom a vote must be cast- in the case of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales on the last occasion there were 73 candidates- to some reasonable number, and, working on the basis of the example I have just given about Tasmania, achieve a result that reflects the will of the people, surely that is what we ought to be doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I suggest that when one is looking for an overall result in an <span class="highlight">election</span> this will always occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, this is a matter that comes up at every <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People say: ‘Look, for goodness sake, you can cut out a lot of nonsense that goes on at elections simply by putting the name of the party. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about the <span class="highlight">election</span> of political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People want to know which party they vote for at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asian Immigration Now’ (other names) and was a candidate in that name at the recent South Australian Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the provisions of the Bill a person may be nominated for <span class="highlight">election</span> only in the name under which he is enrolled or, if he is not enrolled, in the name under which he is entitled to enrol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has led to some very difficult situations, as happened in the most recent Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The order of <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators is based upon the obtaining of a quota, and that quota cannot be determined until all the votes are in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a 3-week period after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> we did not even know what was the quota for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a senator and so it was not possible to proceed with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, quite apart from the problems associated with the re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of the Parliament and the personal difficulties and apprehensions of people involved- not only those who have actually been candidates but also people in the political organisations concernedI think it is relevant to the whole establishment and performance of government that we should know at the very earliest date the outcome of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my home State of Tasmania the use of how to vote cards on <span class="highlight">election</span> day is prohibited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the absence of how-to-vote cards on the day of an <span class="highlight">election</span> has made any difference to the outcome of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every 3 years there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Australian House of Representatives, at which time the Government goes to the people to get approval for what it has been doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fundamental that we should be providing laws which give to every elector in this country an opportunity to have some say in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing this the ultimate wishes of the voters can be achieved by the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Parliament which the people desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A deposit for a candidate in a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be increased from $100 to $250. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the last double dissolution Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> vote in New South Wales is being used to frighten and to suggest to the people that there should be a change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that what we have to be guided by is what has been the general run of the situation with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators and members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often some people do not take sufficient interest in an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Parliament of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They should acquaint themselves sufficiently with what is needed in the elections for the Parliament of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who have worked at a polling booth on <span class="highlight">election</span> day have probably found people, both from interstate and from their home State, who arrive and want to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lots of other people who are probably not as well versed in voting procedures as we might be cannot get a vote on <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore we should cast the net widely and make the voting system elastic so that notwithstanding the faults of the voters we get as many votes as possible, and that when the <span class="highlight">election</span> result is announced it is what the people of the country really intend- a government of their choice elected to govern this country for the following 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other reforms include the prevention of persons enrolling or nominating for <span class="highlight">election</span> under changed names in certain circumstances and restricting postal vote application forms to be used at an <span class="highlight">election</span> or referendum to those specified by notice in the ‘Gazette’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are well aware of the actions of one gentleman who immediately after an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held begins compiling applications for postal votes for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next is the prevention of a person from nominating as a candidate for more than one Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> held on the same day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many of us have seen the abuse of the how to vote card system in many elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the Democratic Labor Party completely wiped out of existence because of its actions in this place and I venture to say that had the Country Party been prepared to run on a separate ticket in that <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate there would be very few of its members here now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are well aware of what took place during the run up to that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is  Senator Wood  admitting that those people are being disfranchised under  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  in the State elections and should not be disfranchised at a federal poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition agrees to it in respect of a State <span class="highlight">election</span> but disagrees with it in respect of a federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we do not hear any objections from those opposite about the polls in local government elections closing at 6 o’clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not many months after, there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> and this farmer happened to be working on the polling booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has usually required at least 52 per cent of the total vote (including preferences) to win a federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it was the farmers who were decisive: they threatened to stand a candidate in a byelection in the Victorian seat of Flinders against the Nationalist hopeful, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, unless the Hughes Government introduced preferential voting in time for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a matter for amendment to the South Australian Electoral Act in connection with voting for the Legislative Council at the <span class="highlight">election</span> next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have a system of <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Council of optional preferential voting, and the Liberal Party in South Australia did not oppose that, so that has gone through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that, we find that this particular gentleman, whom I will not name, leant forward and struck him three or four times over the head with a roll of <span class="highlight">election</span> papers and broke his glasses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to see that we have an amendment there, and I would hope that the disorderliness that does take place at <span class="highlight">election</span> meetings can be dealt with the way it ought to be, and that people who misbehave at political meetings are dealt with in the proper fashion, because no matter whether I agree with the candidate or whether I disagree with him, I think at least he has to have the right to put his case before the people and let the people judge for themselves his or his party’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that the Government is making another attempt to alter the electoral laws of this country, about which it has had a preoccupation since it was elected to government and came to power in December 1 972 and also since its quite narrow <span class="highlight">election</span> victory in May of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not feel that the people of Australia want this Government or any government to be able to ensure its re-<span class="highlight">election</span> almost automatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not feel, because this Government won the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> by such a narrow margin, that it has any right to force upon the people changes in the electoral system that will tend to enshrine it in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country does not need a speedy <span class="highlight">election</span> result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too many alterations to the electoral system in this Bill do not really help the outcome of the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the Bill is designed to allow for speedier finalisation of federal <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the main thrust of the Bill is to seek speedier <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was appalled that Australians should have to wait for their <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possibly of some value to the media in their coverage of an <span class="highlight">election</span>; it is possibly of some value to the Press to be able to state who has or has not won, but in terms of governing a nation speed in getting the result has no value whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take 3 days or 10 days or 5 weeks to learn the result of a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, democracy is well served if it is the right result- using the word right’ in the sense that it is the result that the community wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It depends upon the legislative arrangements for postal voting, it depends upon the efficiency and impartiality of the postal services, and of course it depends upon the existence of industrial peace at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might mention that following the last <span class="highlight">election</span> more people came to me complaining about failures at various points in the postal voting system, more of them complained about their postal voting rights not being fully met according to the way they saw the situation, than about any other electoral matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is proposed in this Bill to restrict postal voting application forms to those gazetted for the particular <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that the question of optional preferential voting is very different in the effects it will have on the House of Representatives and Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to restrict my remarks once again to Senate elections and the effect which optional preferential voting might have in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate that full preferential voting in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> ensures that there are sufficient votes remaining late in the count and available to elect the proper number of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the present system of full preferential voting which ensures that there is always a quota remaining for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the last few senators gives us a result which everyone accepts as the just result even if it is slow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you have a situation, which we have in elections today, where you must vote in some cases for 74 people, but in any case for even 5 or 6 people in a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, you have to say: ‘I prefer No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that it is patently absurd to say that the electorate in Australia can manage elections with even 4 or 5 candidates but, when one gets Senate elections involving 26 or 27 persons, and in the famous case in New South Wales last year involving 73 persons, it is obviously beyond one’s power, because no one can have knowledge of so many people standing for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Those honourable senators from New South Wales will remember the mammoth ballot paper containing the names of 73 candidates who faced the electors of New South Wales in the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If optional preferential voting had been operative at that <span class="highlight">election</span> it would have had 2 effects: First, the time taken and the difficulty involved in filling out the ballot paper correctly would have been greatly reduced and, secondly, the incentive to promote the nomination of a large number of candidates deliberately to produce confusion would have been severely reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anyone argues that they were genuine candidates at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, of course, a provision in the Bill relating to name changes by candidates within a specific period prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, but there are obvious cases where, by long-term planning, this provision could be subverted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that some honourable senators do not like to think that their great names do not draw attention to themselves, but I think we all realise very much that, if any one of us did not have a party affiliation attached to us at Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> time we would not be here at all or, indeed, for as long as some of us have been here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> to a State Parliament or the Federal Parliament should be a serious business, and it ought not to be too much to say that, as this is a serious business, a serious amount of money should be deposited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The setting of a substantial deposit conflicts with the desire to facilitate the nomination of persons genuinely seeking elections to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Few people in Australia would not have been appalled at the uncertainty that followed the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that the uncertainty paralleled that of the 1961 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uncertainty as to the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> creates not merely a paralysis in government but means that the people’s representatives in Parliament are unable for the period of the uncertainty, to exercise the direction of government administration that the electors are entitled to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators will recall the outcry in the Press which reflected very genuine and deep public disquiet at the mechanical inability of the existing electoral system to produce a definite result within a short time after <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the last <span class="highlight">election</span> there was an uncertainty in both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the numbers of each party were that important from the point of view of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, but the question arose whether the Government had a majority in both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that our views may have been coloured by what occurred in New South Wales during the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that anybody claims that there was not a fair amount of frivolity or mischievousness in New South Wales during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when 74 candidates were nominated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to relate a happening which took place during the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren  demonstrates his partisan attitude to this Bill by immediately dividing those who may protest about voters who should not be able to vote in a certain <span class="highlight">election</span> on the basis of whether they may vote Labor or Liberal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that proper objection had been taken to its fullest extent and if there had been time to enable the roll to be cleaned up for a by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, the <span class="highlight">election</span> result would have been quite dramatically different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that  Senator McLaren  and the Government have lost sight of the main objective of the parent section of the Act, which is to ensure that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is as fair as one can make it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They think their great names sweep the poll, but I would like to take a bet against any one of us, including myself, if we stood without a party tag at any Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, as one knows by watching at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, one of the big parties will publish its name in very small print. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The small party could know full well that every elector had picked up a ballot paper in that electorate, or, if it was a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, throughout the whole State, and every elector would know that Joe Blow belonged to the ABC party, or whatever, and not one how-to-vote card would have to be put out by Joe Blow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators know how busy electoral officers are prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> with the closing of nominations, getting ready for the poll, the ballot, <span class="highlight">election</span> day and the count thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Four or five candidates in each case stand for 90 per cent of the seats in elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps 1 will invite him to stand as an independent at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made great play of saying that members seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> to this House did not need to have a tag on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am of the opinion that when people seek <span class="highlight">election</span> to this Parliament under a party flag, are successful, sit in the Parliament and then for political reasons go to <span class="highlight">election</span> under the flag of another party and are returned- as  Senator DrakeBrockman  under the National Alliance- it is a deception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do so the electors, as a whole, will not continue to be misled by opportunists who seek <span class="highlight">election</span> to this place and then, after they are elected, disregard all the promises that they made to the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has to resign his seat in the State Parliament, as he does, and he fails to gain entry into the Federal Parliament, his career is finished until he contests another <span class="highlight">election</span>, hopefully, with the break affecting very adversely his standing in the public in the meantime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position as I understand and know it is this: It has happened on a number of occasions that people have been elected as senators of the Commonwealth of Australia in December, which was the normal time for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, but were not to take office until 1 July the following yearsome have been public servants and one is now a Minister in this House- and they had to relinquish their Public Service office and then wait some time before being sworn in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is defeated at the <span class="highlight">election</span> he still holds that office of profit under the Crown whether it be within a State Parliament or the Commonwealth Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe this matter should be finalised, and very soon, because under State law a school teacher, for instance, can contest a State <span class="highlight">election</span> without resigning from his position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if that person desires to contest a Commonwealth <span class="highlight">election</span> he must resign his position as a teacher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he contests a State <span class="highlight">election</span> he can hold that position of train driver until such duy as he is elected or is defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person could be in the situation quite innocently, of having a common informer object to his <span class="highlight">election</span>, perhaps 6, 12 or 18 months or even 3 years after his <span class="highlight">election</span>, and find himself then subject to a fine of $200 for each sitting day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall just before the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> a Liberal candidate from Western Australia, who was a State school teacher, was advised that he must resign before nominating otherwise he would be incapable of being chosen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had gone ahead, as it could have done under the law and issued the writs or taken whatever action was necessary on a particular night, Michael Hodgman would not have been able to contest the <span class="highlight">election</span>, because 14 days would have been up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as my Leader  Senator Withers  said,  Senator Willesee,  now in charge of the Bill, was thankfully in charge of the Bill that night, and he took action within his own Party to give us a guarantee that the machinery would not be put in action to prevent  Mr Hodgman  from resigning from his seat and contesting the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament may not be sitting at the time, and I believe there is a lot of merit, if we are to make this national Parliament open to those who want to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span>, in having some form of procedure that will enable the member of another parliament to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span> either independently or as an endorsed candidate and, if not elected, to retain the seat he had in the other parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of a Senate or a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in a close seat is not made known until 1 7 or 2 1 days after the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, and the pay of a person elected starts from midnight on the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the member of the State parliament so elected would be entitled to Commonwealth Parliamentary pay from the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and may have, because the end of the month had come, received pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, in layman’s language, one would have to say that a candidate who was a member of a State parliament should sign some form of declaration that his pay as a State member would cease as from the date of his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament, and if he had received a cheque during the course of waiting for the declaration of the poll that would be returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May I stood for <span class="highlight">election</span> again and won a long-term seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that something should be done whereby a State member standing for the Federal Parliament should be able to retain his seat until he knows the result of the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter is not now as nicely boxed as those who will oppose my amendment might imagine because, as one honourable senator has already said, the existing clauses mean that it would be possible for a federal administration, if it so desired deliberately to fix the time between nominations and the issuing of the writ, to preclude any member of a State parliament from standing at a federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, we did not want a byelection to be held in the seat that I was vacating before the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we can ensure that the government of the day does something before the next <span class="highlight">election</span> by either passing my amendment or refusing to pass the clause in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am wondering whether he has in mind one of his colleagues in the South Australian State Parliament who we think will run as a Liberal Movement candidate for the Senate at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Willesee,  coming from the same State as I, will know that for many years there were 2 well-known candidates, the late Carlyle Ferguson and the late Claude Swain, who were nominated, I think at every <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Perth City Council, the Legislative Assembly, the Legislative Council, the Senate and the House of Representativesyou name it, they were candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750416_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This provision has worked quite successfully in State elections in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> a large number of people in the Kalgoorlie Division in Western Australia, who had written in requesting a postal vote and who had received a ballot paper back, found they had no capacity to get their vote in because the ballot paper arrived too late to allow them to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of representations made to me by some of my electors in the Division of Kalgoorlie after the last electionI raised this matter with the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the shorter period allowed between the close of nominations and the poll, it is estimated that some 300 people in remote areas in the Division of Kalgoorlie never got a vote at the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 18 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please advise when we may expect to receive our ballot papers in this area for Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> 1 8 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the Opposition’s proposal envisages that as soon as practicable after the close of nominations for an <span class="highlight">election</span> the divisional returning officer will send postal voting material to the electors who are registered on the register for his division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had in the back of my mind that the period from the close of nominations to <span class="highlight">election</span> day was of the order of 3 weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People living in these outlying areas know that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on a Saturday, whatever the date is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did not press our amendment to the proposal to alter the postal vote form so that there will be different forms for each <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had not altered the earlier provisions, this clause may well have stood on its own; but, as the change in the form to be used for each <span class="highlight">election</span> ought to prevent most of the previous abuses which went on in this area, I think it is only reasonable that as far as possible all that happens in the electoral system should be open to inspection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These applications ought to be open for inspection and persons who are interested ought to abe able to go along and see who voted at the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time section 89 (3) of the Act provides that all applications for postal votes shall be open for public inspection at all convenient times during office hours from and including the third day after polling day until the <span class="highlight">election</span> can be no longer questioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been found that this entitlement has been misused by certain persons who list the names of electors who recorded postal votes and retain such a list until just prior to the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, when postal vote applications are forwarded to those electors without really knowing whether they are still entitled or desire to vote by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s amendment is consistent with its attitude of retaining the present situation which the Government believes is unsatisfactory and is conducive to delays in the finalisation of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the average number of names on the ballot papers for House of Representatives seats was five- not seventythree as in the case of the Senate, for which we have a system of running in teams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in the electorates of both  Mr Whitlam  and  Mr Snedden,  merely because at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> they were the leaders of the 2 major parties that were in confrontation with each other, there was a great number of candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  knows that political scientists can substantiate claims that a certain percentage of votes at an <span class="highlight">election</span> goes to the candidate whose name is first on the list. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see not one whit of reason why the Opposition would oppose a provision that would give sitting members at least the right to fight an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the basis of their performance rather than have to contend with smartalec tricks used by their political opponents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause, which the Opposition seeks to omit, provides for the order of the names of the candidates on the ballot papers for a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> to be determined by means of a draw instead of by alphabetical order of surnames as at present exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a close <span class="highlight">election</span>, this could well influence the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason I thought I would give this somewhat interesting if useless information to the Committee is that it shows that whilst it may appear to  Senator Hall  that persons whose surnames begin with ‘C and ‘B’ appear to have a great advantage in an <span class="highlight">election</span>, I do not think that basically they do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Democratic Labor Party if the names of candidates in an <span class="highlight">election</span> are drawn from a hat, because the DLP used to be very rigid with its preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well known that the DLP used to wait to see who the other candidates were in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Withers was the name of a candidate in a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> one could wager guineas to gooseberries that the DLP would not have a candidate named Young as its candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that they were very disappointed that they drew so far down the ballot paper in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in which 1 was elected, because I happened to come into this place on the Liberal Party’s preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is hoping that the Democratic Labor Party, or as it is rightly known the Dummy Liberal Party, will come back into the field at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and that he will get some gain out of it by having candidates on the ballot paper whose surname begins with the letter A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I always remember  Sir Robert  Menzies saying that a government elected to Parliament under a certain system of voting never changes that system, because people who do not like it bring down their wrath on the government at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding whether there is a so-called donkey vote- and I hate that expression- if one looked up the records of the 1966 <span class="highlight">election</span>, when Prime Minister Holt was returned to power with the biggest majority the non-Labor parties have had in my term in the Parliament, one would see, I believe, that 23 new people were elected as members of the Liberal-Country Party coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite a large percentage of seats in Australia are or have been semi-blue ribbon or blue ribbon seats but in the 1 966 <span class="highlight">election</span> the people of Australia- they were not changing a government, but were re-electing it to office with a new Prime Minister- elected, out of a total of 123 members, 23 new members to the Parliament from the non-Labor Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is alleged that the proposed system works satisfactorily in Queensland State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No evidence has been presented to me to indicate that the Queensland electors jump for joy about the beautiful hours on State polling day but bitterly resent those on Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators on the Government side were as confident as they make out that they are of being returned at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, why worry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are quite confident that, no matter when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, we will know by 10 p.m. that night that we are in by a large majority because the vote will be such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will come a tremendous fall when we have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is most important is that we get the right <span class="highlight">election</span> result so that everyone’s vote can count and everyone ‘s vote can be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is just a matter of expediency to achieve quick <span class="highlight">election</span> results, they are not going to be impressed, and that answer is just not good enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of those people has ever complained to me when an <span class="highlight">election</span> has been held in summer that they, because of their faith, have not been able to attend polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have made arrangements for postal votes when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held in hours when they cannot attend in person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Postal votes would be required only when elections are held in the time of the year when daylight hours are longer and the sun sets after 6 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that he moved an amendment which sought the establishment of a special register for general postal voters under which people who find that they cannot get to a polling booth on <span class="highlight">election</span> day can register as general postal voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My main concern is the comments made by  Senator Withers  about Government members using sob sister sort of stuff- they were his own words- in claiming that the long hours of work on <span class="highlight">election</span> day had inconvenienced polling booth workers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As 1 pointed out in my speech on the second reading, <span class="highlight">election</span> day is a very long day for those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am there and I have not missed an <span class="highlight">election</span> for a long, long time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of weeping about the terrible amount of work to be done on <span class="highlight">election</span> day but 1 have never heard any great moans and groans amongst the people who work at polling booths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What has not been mentioned tonight in this debate is the fact that 6 o’clock closing applies at the present time in any summer <span class="highlight">election</span> in three of the 4 eastern States, because of daylight saving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many thousands of such voters in the eastern States of Australia, with the exception of Queenslanders who have not yet been enlightened about the value and the advantages of daylight saving, cannot vote in an <span class="highlight">election</span> held in summer when the polls close at 8 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been there at State elections and have worked in that area with the Party to which I belong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that  Senator Baume  said, in answer to an interjection during the second reading debate, that we should have a public holiday when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that elections should be held on a day of the week other than a Saturday so that everybody can be accommodated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many thousands of those workers still would not be able to attend the polling booth even if a public holiday were declared for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not a great inconvenience for any person who is likely to find himself in this position to make the normal application for such a vote and to cast his vote on the day prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In State elections, as has been expressed by  Senator Milliner,  6 o ‘clock closing already exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No great attempt is being made by the Government to stop any person who desires to vote in an <span class="highlight">election</span> from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Wood  is talking a lot of humbug when he speaks against the proposal in respect to federal elections and will not, under any circumstances, attempt to change the <span class="highlight">election</span> hours in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He says that the number of Jewish people there does not matter in a State <span class="highlight">election</span> but it is important in a federal <span class="highlight">election</span> because there is a far greater number of persons in the other States of the faith of  Senator Baume  and it is far more important in the other States because more people are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was impressed by  Senator Milliner’s  conviction that all was well in Queensland where 6 p.m. closing at State elections was proving so successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me that, politically, in the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> which closed at 8 p.m. the success of his Party in Queensland was somewhat greater than it was in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> when the polls closed at 6 p.m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750421_senate_29_s63/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time  Sir Charles,  in common with many other wishful thinkers in the Liberal Party and Country Party, was supremely confident that the Opposition would reject the Supply Bills and that the Whitlam Government would be defeated in a mid-year <span class="highlight">election</span>, that Medibank would be aborted and that he would be acclaimed by his fellow obstructionists in the non-Labor States as a hairy-chested and successful Canberra basher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Faced with reality and with the subsequent knowledge that, because of the factional fighting within the Liberal Party and the blood letting in mid-March, the Liberal Party was in no condition to reject the Supply Bills or to face an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and the consequential facts that Medibank would be funded in the Supply Bills and would be operative from 1 July, and knowing that the people of Western Australia would, when they became informed, turn in anger on the government responsible for the State’s nonparticipation, and knowing that his monumental miscalculation about the future of the Whitlam Government was the direct cause of his dilemma,  Sir Charles  Court and his Government sought protection from retribution by throwing up a smokescreen of blatant untruths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before the 1974 State <span class="highlight">election</span>  Sir Charles  Court claimed that he could, as he said, put things right’, and said: ‘Inflation to a substantial degree can be beaten State by State’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750422_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must admit that before my <span class="highlight">election</span> I had never thought or worried about superannuation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt at all that, contrary to the sorts of stories that were attempted to be put across about the Premier last year, particularly during the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, he did sincerely make an approach to the Prime Minister in March and April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750423_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to an interview which  Mr Whitiam  gave to David Frost in 1972 before the <span class="highlight">election</span> which saw  Mr Whitlam  become Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The most heartening thing about Thailand, I think, is the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> which at long last installed a civilian government there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did not the Australian Metalworkers Union exercise the freedom of an organisation in this country to give its support to the Australian Labor Party, prior to the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did it not, before that <span class="highlight">election</span>, require the Prime Minister to attend its executive meeting and promise not to enforce the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, before the union granted the Labor Party $25,000? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Leader of the Government in the Senate or any other Minister of the Government or the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions take any steps during the recent shipping strike to exempt Tasmanian shipping from the strike and so fulfil the promises made by both Australian Labor Party members and the  President  of the ACTU prior to the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>may, and at the request of any scrutineer shall, also put to any person claiming to vote all or any of the following questions: (iti) Have you already voted either here or elsewhere in this <span class="highlight">election</span> (or in these elections, as the case requires)? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have you already voted either here or elsewhere in this <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Committee that surely the most important question to be put is: ‘Have you already voted in this <span class="highlight">election</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely the $64 question the presiding officer asks an elector when he comes up to the table is the first mandatory question in section 115: ‘Have you already voted either here or elsewhere in this <span class="highlight">election</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposed amendment- I do not think it is something which the Government ought to object to- to clause 42, paragraph (b) of sub-section 1 is to move sub-paragraph (iii) out of paragraph (b) as an optional question, that is ‘Have you already voted either here or elsewhere in this <span class="highlight">election</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put to the Committee that surely the most important question then to be asked is not whether I live within the division, but: ‘Have you already voted in this <span class="highlight">election</span>?’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do say that the question ‘Have you already voted either here or elsewhere in this <span class="highlight">election</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, after an <span class="highlight">election</span>, as honourable senators know, the rolls are combed through to find the people who did not vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 123 ( 1) (a) of the principal Act states that when an elector has a ballot paper for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> he shall place the number 1 in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom he votes as his first preference, and shall place the numbers, 2, 3, 4 and so on as the case requires in the squares opposite the names of all the remaining candidates so as to indicate the order of his preference for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of that provision will be that in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> an elector needs to mark the ballot paper only up to the number of candidates required, which in effect is optional preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distinction is that section 123 of the principal Act provides for full preferential voting and the purpose of clause 45 is to introduce into Senate elections optional preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard that many of the amendments proposed to the principal Act have been introduced because in the State of New South Wales there were 72 or 73 candidates for the Senate in the last double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The argument is that in that <span class="highlight">election</span> the number of informal votes was excessive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That argument can apply to all sorts of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will quote to honourable senators the number of informal votes cast at various elections since proportional representation was introduced in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conjoint House of Representatives-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 10 December 1949- I admit there was a large number of candidates because the Senate was being expanded from 36 members to 60 members - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The informal vote at that <span class="highlight">election</span> was 10.76 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 28 April 1951 the informal vote was 7.13 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was held on 9 April 1953 the informal vote dropped to 4.56 per cent, which was quite a dramatic drop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conjoint <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December 1 955 the informal vote rose to 9.63 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conjoint <span class="highlight">election</span> on 22 November 1958 it was 10.29 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the conjoint <span class="highlight">election</span> on 9 December 1961 it was 10.62 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> on 5 December 1964 in fell to 6.98 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> on 25 November 1967 it was 6. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the separate <span class="highlight">election</span> on 2 1 November 1970, for some reason which is not explained, it rose to 9.41 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a conjoint <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in the form of a double dissolution in an attempt to elect 10 candidates, again the informal vote rose to 10.77 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another interesting point is that the informal vote at House of Representatives elections has remained almost constant, varying between a low of, say, 1.9 per cent and a high of 3.1 per cent, which is hardly any enormous variation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it does not do much for our egos in this place but, after all, many people tend to regard polling day at a conjoint <span class="highlight">election</span> as the occasion on which to elect a government rather than individual members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose if one looked around for theoretical reasons for the oddity of the vote on 21 November 1970 one would realise that it was a peculiar <span class="highlight">election</span> for a number of reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that that <span class="highlight">election</span> produced 3 Democratic Labor Party senators, which was somewhat unusual, and that 2 of them obtained quotas in their own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the <span class="highlight">election</span> at which both major parties were basically rejected by the electorate and at which the Independents had a pretty free run. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all that theorising is worth, I think that may well account for the rise in the informal vote to 9.41 per cent in that odd separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1 970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are the major parties to be elected to office or sent into opposition on the votes of the least intelligent in the communitythose who need mark the ballot paper with only the number 1 in a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and with the numbers 1 to 5 when voting in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At elections for both those Assemblies the optional preferential system worked quite satisfactorily and was much easier for the people who went to the polls than the full preferential system was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was particularly so in the case of the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales where the ballot paper was a mile long, to use a fishing term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken out some figures of the informal votes at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in May last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will speak in more detail about this matter when we are debating clause 46 because I have evidence from my personal investigations of House of Representatives or State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a lot of people in our community today who, unfortunately, cannot count to the numbers required at the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is interesting is if one looks at the figures for New South Wales one finds that in 1 974 the rate of informality was 12.31 per cent and that at that <span class="highlight">election</span> there were 73 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An examination of earlier elections reveals that on 3 previous occasions the informality rate exceeded 12 per cent and that on two of those occasions it was greater than it was in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the Minister will agree that wherever optional preferential voting has been used and wherever there has been a quota for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators- even going back to the New South Wales experience in the 1920s- exhausted votes have meant that quotas could no longer be met for the later candidates to be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It happened at an <span class="highlight">election</span> which I personally contested in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not arguing,  Senator Withers,  that the Labor Party should have won the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made that comment with reference to the 4 referendum proposals which were put conjointly with the 1974 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so they are far more responsible and intelligent than at least one of the candidates who was endorsed by  Senator Scott’s  Party for the 1 974 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not hard to see the Pandora’s Box that would open and the bloodbath that would ensue between the two uneasy partners in the Opposition if they had to come to that sort of an arrangement before an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind  Senator Withers  of certain events that took place in Victoria prior to the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> when the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was changed because the Country Party then, as it is doing now, was holding a gun at the head of the Liberal Party and demanding the introduction of preferential voting at the next federal <span class="highlight">election</span> as a pre-condition to the Country Party not standing candidates against the Liberal Party in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We still have State elections in which one must vote for every person on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would happen if we were to have a federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in which one had to vote for only some of the candidates? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may well be argued- I am not suggesting that I have any proof on the subject- that this would result in informal voting occurring in the State elections and in other ways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that a lot of work needs to be done in convincing the people and those authorities that determine the holding of elections in the States that this is a desirable scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing I want to make my support of the preferential system of voting for Lower House elections quite clear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in support of the idea of limited preferences under this optional system of voting only because there is a very distinct overload on the type of voting at present, as was demonstrated at the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the rather dynamic political scene that exists in Australia we can perhaps expect more elections to occur in the future- in the mid-term- in which a large number of candidates may very well present themselves for selection to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that is very much slower than checking from one to ten, as would have been the case in the <span class="highlight">election</span> that was referred to, or from one to five if it had been a normal year in which there was not a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause proposes an amendment to section 123 of the principal Act, which deals with the method of marking of votes at a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the optional preferential system of voting which is proposed, although it is mandatory to vote only for the number of persons to be elected- one in the case of a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and five in the case of a normal periodical Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- every voter has the option of indicating further preferences for some or all of the remaining candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>73, as in the case of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> for New South Wales, or whatever the number of candidates might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I may know the sitting senators; but I have never seen or heard a television appearance or a radio broadcast or addresses at public meetings by my opponents or, if I am not involved in the <span class="highlight">election</span>, by the people in whom I am interested, because generally I have been out campaigning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the case of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> the number to be elected is five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let me refer to the experience of the 1 974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">election</span> highlights the absurdity of requiring voters to indicate a preference for all candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was an example of this relationship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of the 1 974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, including the concurrent holding of a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and 4 referendums, may be of interest to honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are the figures for the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales, with 73 candidates, the informal vote reached 12.3 per cent or a staggering 332 818 ballot papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall percentage was 10.77 per cent, which accounted for 798 126 Senate ballot papers being wasted at the 1974 Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have given the figures for one <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further example might be seen by taking the 1970 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actually they vote for only 5 candidates in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, but in order to make the vote formal they have to fill in the whole of the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this clause were to be omitted from the Bill the effect would be that full preferential voting as presently enforced for House of Representatives elections would be retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true of course that far fewer candidates generally stand at House of Representatives elections than at Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the proposed optional preferential system the voter at a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> must indicate his first preference for one candidate and may indicate his further preferences for some or all of the remaining candidates as he so desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think it has been one of the distinguishing features of Australian politics that those who wish to say things during the period of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign are known, and I think they ought to be known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who read <span class="highlight">election</span> material between the issue of the writ and polling day ought to know the author of that material, ought to know the address of that author and certainly ought to know who the printer is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is fair enough in the day to day affairs of the nation, but, as we all know, during an <span class="highlight">election</span> period quite often serious allegations are made against all of us either as individuals or as candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On and after the date of issue and before the return of any writ for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a member of the Senate, or of the House of Representatives, or for the taking of any referendum vote, every article report, letter or other matter commenting upon any candidate, or political party, or the issues being submitted to the electors, printed and published in any newspaper, circular, pamphlet, or ‘dodger’ shall be signed by the author or authors, giving his or their true name and address or names and addresses at the end of the said article, report, letter, or other matter, or where part only of the article, report, letter, or other matter . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is generally known that, together with  Mr Giese, Mr Perkins  hopes to be a National Party candidate at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is making an international trip to denigrate the Australian Labor Party to enhance his pre-selection prospects in Alice Springs next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is particularly evidenced in the case of  Mr Grassby  because his statements after his <span class="highlight">election</span> defeat in 1974 indicated almost a paranoia about what had happened to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the December 1974 issue of ‘Viewpoint’ as an example- it is one of the least offensive examples I have seen- it will be seen that the issue is devoted to explaining the Association’s activities in the electorate of Riverina at the time of the May 1 974 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also discovered that there had been no increase in tariffs in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year until Labor came to office, despite the fact that increases were long overdue, justified and urgently required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I leave it to the imagination of honourable senators why the Liberal-Country Party governments never had an increase in tariffs in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This issue of the amount of the Advance to the Treasurer evidences that deceit, and it is one of many points of evidence, ranging from the false <span class="highlight">election</span> promises about maintaining full employment and controlling inflation to some of the hypocritical utterances about respecting Parliament and exposing for parliamentary approval legislation which the Government proposes to introduce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the theory of the Westminster system is that the control which Parliament exercises over this type of expenditure and conduct is that Parliament refuses to give the money to the Government to enable it to carry on its business, but where a Parliament does that- and in this case the Senate has the power- that action is tantamount to inviting the Government to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though Opposition senators might skite about their ability to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> again, there is far from any certainty that they would be returned in sufficient numbers to control either one or both of the Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for a redistribution is exemplified by the projected enrolments as at May 1977, the approximate date of the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, which show that compared with the enrolments as at 25 April 1974 the following changes will take place: Bonython, 83 388, will increase to 90 000; Kingston, 72 830, will increase to 78 000; and Sturt, 69 0 1 1 , will increase to 72 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Perhaps the best thing that can be said about  Senator Hall  is that he was such a political genius in his State that he had a redistribution which was unfavourable to himself and then had an <span class="highlight">election</span>, 12 months before it was needed, on a non-issue which he could not win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of life is that the present boundaries throughout Australia are fair and equitable if one accedes to the proposition that a national <span class="highlight">election</span> is held to elect a national Parliament and to form a government as a result of that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the present boundaries are fair and equitable on a national basis has been proved at the last 2 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Senate that the proposal, if carried, in any event would mean that these boundaries would last for only one <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: If these proposed boundaries in New South Wales will be valid only for the elections to be held, say, in 1977, why has the electorate of Hume, of 17 000 square miles, 65 000 electors and the city electorate of Lang, of 9 square miles, only 60 000 electors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the simple reason that if Kalgoorlie had been brought within the tolerance the Liberal Party would have won that seat quite easily at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the present electoral climate, even a marginal seat like Sturt will most likely be won by a swing of 10 per cent at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I forecast with the firmest of convictions that the redistribution proposals will pass the scrutiny of Parliament before the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I honestly and earnestly believe that the next House of Representatives elections will be held under this proposed redistribution which we are considering now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that will happen in political terms is that the composition of the Senate which is now 60 members and which will be 64 members after the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, will alter and a majority in this place, which will be added to by my Party, will provide a free passage for these redistribution proposals when they are presented to the Senate after 1 July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a lesson to all of those who want to know what the community thinks about electoral reform to study the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> which was held last year in that seat, and to study the policies which the parties put openly and vigorously to that community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I notice that he is taking this electoral fight right back into South Australia by going to the electorate of Goyder to help the candidate who is standing in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to the Senate that after the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, which will be effective from 1 July next year, this Bill will be passed, and members of the House of Representatives had better prepare themselves for the prospect of fighting the next federal <span class="highlight">election</span> on the boundaries which we are now considering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason I rise to make a small comment in this debate is because of the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  who accused  Mr Foster,  a former member of the other place, of using taxpayers’ funds to ensure his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Legislative Council in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it was quite wrong for  Senator Withers  to make that statement because, due to  Mr Foster’s  position on the ballot paper, he is assured of <span class="highlight">election</span> without expending one cent in the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 on the ballot paper for the Legislative Council <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is beyond my comprehension how  Senator Withers  could arrive at that conclusion and make the statement that  Mr Foster  is using taxpayers ‘ money to secure <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a little intrigued to hear him say that after the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> he will have the numbers in this place to ensure passage of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, I hope, along with  Senator Hall,  that there are sufficient numbers in this place after the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to ensure the passage of this legislation so that the electors of Australia will be able to elect a government on a democratic franchise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Candidates are not supposed to spend more than a certain minimal amount on an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any Party that comes forward with a policy cannot honestly say at <span class="highlight">election</span> time that it will implement that policy if it is going to be saddled with a splinter group, a pressure group, like the National Country Party which demands its pound of flesh for every decision that is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even then, as they say they are going to win the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, if they are really sincere and things happen as they think they will, they might form the government of this country after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> in their own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I envisage that if the next <span class="highlight">election</span> is conducted on the proposed boundaries the Liberal Party will win the seat of Grey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard him make predictions on <span class="highlight">election</span> results early in the evening on polling day that have certainly led me to believe that he is not as accurate in some of his estimates as perhaps he thinks he is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the attitude outlined by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  and I look forward to the next <span class="highlight">election</span> when we can deal with the Government and return to the treasury bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned before that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Party just scraped home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a dishonest attempt by the Government to force upon the people of Australia a government that they will not want, in my opinion, at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Hall  that if his Liberal Movement is prepared to support redistribution following the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> he should make that very clear to the people of Australia so that the people in those electorates in which he has candidates know just what they are letting themselves in for if they do elect any more of the people of the calibre of  Senator Hall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government has decided not to have a redistribution there- not on your life- because it knows very well that if it does it will lose at least one seat at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if there is no change in the electoral boundaries in Western Australia I think that the division of Kalgoorlie will become a Liberal Party seat after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me forecast now that even if this redistribution proposal does not go through the Labor Party will be lucky to have any Tasmanian representatives in the House of Representatives after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I predict that he will be the first person to fall at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, if indeed he does stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that company lost money last year and it could well close down before the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, or following it if the Labor Party is returned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been advised that in the electorate of Denison the zinc company may have to put off more than one-third of its work force before the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another thing about these redistributions that has not been mentioned is that we have to remember that they are to be used for the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Townley had some unfortunate things to say about  Mr Duthie  who, he assures us, will lose the seat of Wilmot at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Barnard  also will lose his seat at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, I am told by  Senator Townley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Townley  certainly does not agree with him because he said that even if the redistribution goes through Labor will win all 5 seats at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that the Bill has been drafted purely and simply to enable the Government to say: ‘We are observing our <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to set up an Inter-State Commission’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No one has ever discussed the racism that was involved in the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the seat of Riverina when  Mr Grassby  won. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact what used to happen was that, instead of these Country Party politicians tramping around their vast electorates, within a year of being elected they moved to the city to live, outside their electorates and they were never seen except when they were canvassing for an <span class="highlight">election</span> or when the local show was on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers  said the other day, in response to a very cutting interjection from  Senator Hall:  ‘Perhaps the best thing that could be said about  Senator Hall  is that he was such a political genius in his State that he had a redistribution which was unfavourable to himself, and then had an <span class="highlight">election</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only reason for it is if the Government could see an opportunity to rig the boundaries before the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and so ensure that it could maintain office for at least another 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the redistribution in Victoria has been carried out to ensure that the Labor members who won seats at the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974 following the double dissolution will be entrenched in those seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not my duty to advocate that the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Lamb)  should be entrenched in his seat with a certain percentage of the votes, whereas in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> he just scraped through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal vote in the electorate of Isaacs was slightly more than 50 per cent, and there was a very close finish in that seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the 13 seats eight- that is, Berowra, Eastwood, Robertson, Hughes, Lang, Sydney, Kingsford-Smith and Grayndler- have been altered in minor ways that have no real bearing upon the electoral result or the result of any future <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the Senate that for the <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 18 May 1974 the vote in New South Wales for the Australian Labor Party was 52.7 per cent of the total. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the last <span class="highlight">election</span> there was a tremendous amount of agitation, particularly among young voters, for certain changes in our electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition senators say: ‘Well, you won the last two elections’ but I put it to them in another way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they looked back to the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span> they would find that there were one or two seats at least throughout the Commonwealth where there had been vital variations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The strategy of members of the Opposition is to fight a rearguard action, deny us any electoral reform and to say to themselves: ‘When we come to the <span class="highlight">election</span> next year we will feel a little easier’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My answer to that is simply that the great leveller in elections is the mobility of electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, he has the added burden of knowing that if he does not perform in these areas and does not reach up to the requirements which go to make up a sort of six million dollar man’, he has to face at periodic intervals an <span class="highlight">election</span> which might result in his losing his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To suggest that 5 members of a council would be victimising people does not hold water because they would be tossed out at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, the same as we would be if we were not doing our job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wood and  Senator Scott,  who spoke for the opposition on the Bill earlier this year, claimed that they opposed it because simultaneous elections would damage the independence of the Senate and alter its role. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The independence of the Senate was not founded on elections being held for the 2 Houses at different times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear that the framers of our Constitution did not regard separate elections in this sense as basic to the Senate’s role as an independent House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Review recommended this particular reform in 1958 and again in 1959- with only one member dissenting- there had been only 3 occasions on which an <span class="highlight">election</span> had been held to elect members of one House only- those for the House of Representatives in 1929 and 1954 and that for the Senate in 1 953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1 959, however, there have been no fewer than 9 national elections, four of them for the House of Representatives alone, and three of them for the Senate alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why on earth we need to go into this extended area of risk, because that is what is it, I do not know other than to say that apparently the Liberal Party sees this move as a closer step towards a possible <span class="highlight">election</span> and there may be some possible use of the insurance industry as an ally in such an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prime Minister’s 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech included the following promise: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was then a run-off <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Christian Democrats voted for him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was elected ultimately he was elected with over 60 per cent of the votes because the Christian Democratic Party supported him in the run-off <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If only we had a television camera and if every word of  Senator Greenwood  could be heard and every gesture and grimace of  Senator Wright  could be seen we would not need to spend a penny on any <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign; we would win with an undisputed majority, the same sort of majority as that which was gained by  Dr Allende  when he was elected  President  of Chile in the last democratic elections that took place in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the question of amalgamations was not solved in accordance with the policy we had put forward during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we introduced into the Senate in August 1974 another Bill to provide for amalgamations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it simply that the Government wants to have restored to the Senate notice paper a number of Bills that have been defeated three or four times and have the Opposition express its opposition to them once more so that when it comes to adding up the grand total- the time when some double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span> is to take place in the future- there is a mighty score that runs into three figures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that rank and file members of any organisation that has the collegiate style of <span class="highlight">election</span> may not vote for a period of 3 years after the amalgamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When one considers the record of this Government and its ability to twist the facts, to falsify and to misrepresent- leaving aside the outrageous lies which they engage in at <span class="highlight">election</span> times- I think there is something deplorable in the fact that this misrepresentation is engaged in by a few union officials connected with the Public Service unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting to hear  Senator Greenwood  repudiating the sentiments in what his then Leader,  Mr Snedden,  and other spokesmen for the Opposition Parties said at various stages over the last two or three years, and even repudiating, I suggest, the policy statement on national superannuation which  Mr Chipp  issued on 21 April 1974 which, of course, was during the period of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course,  Mr Chipp  was speaking for the Opposition Parties at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>- when obviously he was vote catching; he was seeking to get support from Commonwealth public servants- the Opposition pledged itself to support a scheme that was in advance of all existing superannuation schemes in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am moved to speak because on Friday and over the weekend in Launceston there was delivered to homes an <span class="highlight">election</span> pamphlet on the front of which appeared the words: ‘Kevin Newman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure we all realise that under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund legislation introduced by the former Minister for Defence,  Mr Barnard,  Lieutentant-Colonel Newman would receive a lump sum of about $23,500, if he wished it, plus approximately $5000 a year which would have been a help if he was defeated in the <span class="highlight">election</span> and retired to the farm that he already owns in Tasmania and would have been a very healthy addition to his parliamentary salary if he was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his policy speech delivered a little over a year ago before the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>, which resulted in the rout of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam  did undertake to provide half of the cost of building a new general hospital in Launceston, something which had been neglected for 23 years by LiberalCountry Party governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since the December 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> when the Liberal-Country Parties were thrown out of power, and now that they are the Opposition, they seem to have flatly refused to accept the verdict of the people; they do not seem to realise and appreciate that they are no longer the Government; that they are the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The irony of that is that such action could not have been taken before the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span> without the support of Democratic Labor Party, the Party that endorsed  Senator Drake-Brockman  and helped elect him to this Senate at the 1974 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a major issue on which the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> will bc fought, ignoring the smears and sneers of an Opposition which has, to its eternal discredit,  the current majority foreign ownership or control of A Australia ‘s mineral and energy resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Liberal Movement leader Steele Hall in the propaganda for his Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign makes much of his claim to be more ‘progressive’ than the official Liberals with whom he has bitter personal quarrels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750709_senate_29_s64/#debate-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 say that Frank Shanahan was an unsuccessful candidate in the elections in the New South Wales Branch of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia declared in or about March 1 974 and was one of a number of candidates including myself who campaigned jointly for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He told me that he had heard the same rumours as myself that there was a defect in the last Tasmanian Branch <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia due to nominations not being advertised but said that he did not know whether this was correct and could only suggest I search the newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In or about mid- 1972 Egan said to me that in preparing for our 1973-1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia in New South Wales it would be necessary for the campaign to be placed on a proper footing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Norm Bray was the only one of our candidates who had been successful in obtaining <span class="highlight">election</span> to a salaried position in the 1973-1974 elections and I feared that Shanahan might be pressured into making some statement which might be used against Norm Bray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#debate-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the <span class="highlight">election</span> after the double dissolution in 1 974 it was apparent that, in particular, the Country Party- as it then was- and also the Liberal Party had up to 20 times the amount of cash to spend on their campaigns as the Labor Party had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Dame Ivy was the first woman elected to the Senate to represent Victoria and played a full and active role in this chamber from her <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1949 until her retirement in July 1 97 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My personal interest in her political career was, of course, that I was the  chairman  of the selection committee of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party which in 1 949 selected  Mrs Wedgwood,  as she then was, to be a Liberal Party candidate for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750819_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the experiences of the last 2 elections, if this Parliament ignores the position, if it allows this dangerous situation to continue whereby democracy is made ridiculous by the inability of individual candidates to match the machines and the hysteria of Party machines becomes even more overpowering, then it will in retrospect look ludicrous and ridiculous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One recalls very well a statement made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that all the benefits that the Labor Government would seek to bring to this community could be brought about without increased taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government would not have the honesty to say that it believes that when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is near or when the writs are issued members of the Opposition, Ministers and members of the Government should lose the benefits and the facilities they have as a result of being members of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that the money has been spent in the hope that there will be a kickback to the Labor Party at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It provides that a party contesting all seats in the House of Representatives would be allowed to spend $606,000-odd on the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amount of money ought to be sufficient to allow the big parties- the Liberal Party and the Labor Party- to put fairly and squarely before the electors what they term to be their propaganda, their platform for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  delivered the policy speech on behalf of the Australian Labor Party during the campaign for the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> nothing could have been clearer than what he said on the subject of the Bill which is before the Senate at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the people of Australia voted for the Australian Labor Party in May 1974 this is one of the things for which they were voting, but because of the oddities of our Constitution and our electoral system and because of the behaviour of the Premier of New South Wales we do not have the representation in the Upper House that we have in the Lower House and we are unable to pass the legislation which any government should be entitled to introduce- that is, those matters which are put to the people at an <span class="highlight">election</span> and are adopted by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We simply say that if the Government feels that it has not sufficient control of the Parliament to pass its measures, it has a ready means of determining that issue, and that is the traditional course which other Governments on other occasions have pursued of asking the GovernorGeneral for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We called on the <span class="highlight">election</span> and we won. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that  Mr Barry  Cotterrell is the endorsed Australian Labor Party candidate for the Brisbane City Council ward of Camp Hill for the forthcoming municipal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Barry  Cotterrell is still employed by the Commonwealth Public Service, when will this employment terminate to allow  Mr Cotterrell  to conduct his campaign for the forthcoming municipal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that it can be done by <span class="highlight">election</span> and appointment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After 23 years of allowing Australia to lie fallow so far as corporate raiders were concerned, on the eve of the  1972  <span class="highlight">election</span> and in the face of a tide of economic nationalism which had arisen at that time, belatedly but inadequately the then Government acted and produced the  1972  takeover legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of South Australia the State Legislative Council rejected the transfer legislation and a State <span class="highlight">election</span> ensued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr McMahon,  when he introduced the legislation, said that it was interim legislation and that the following year, assuming the <span class="highlight">election</span> went all right, an independent authority would be established to determine the takeovers which ought to be rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was the April policy speech before the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> when the Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, this Bill is a very pale reflection, if it could be called a reflection, of what the Government promised prior to its <span class="highlight">election</span> and shortly after its <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought not to be forgotten that the Labor Party put itself forward before its <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 as the only party which was interested in this subject and which had great proposals to which it would give effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be interested to hear from the Opposition members, who talk so freely about secret ballots in trade unions and the democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> of trade union officials- something with which I largely agree- when they are going to call for a secret ballot amongst the policy holders in these insurance companies - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In reply I would say firstly that the Brisbane City Council elections are not due until 27 March next year, which is 7 months away, and, secondly, that it has never been assumed that employment in the Public Service in itself prohibits people from campaigning for public office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will know that the normal procedure in the case of public servants who seek <span class="highlight">election</span> to State or Federal Parliaments is for them to resign before the close of nominations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Cotterrell  will of course resign from his employment if he is successful at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present statistical returns for each State showing the voting within each subdivision in relation to the Senate <span class="highlight">Election</span> 1974 and the General Elections for the House of Representatives 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I understand that  Mr Michael  Baume, a company director, and the endorsed Liberal Party candidate for the next <span class="highlight">election</span> joined Patrick Partners in 1969. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Act as it stands, he is the candidate for Macarthur at the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">election</span> year they received an increase in their pension- sometimes 50c a week and sometimes 75c a week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the political advertisements of the Liberal Party in South Australia during the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> there we see that they blatantly stated, ‘Sweep out Socialism ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government to a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will not force a general <span class="highlight">election</span> by rejecting the Budget in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Liberal Party is not at all contrite and obviously it intends to continue to promote the speculation about another premature <span class="highlight">election</span> and hopes thereby to sabotage the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not here trying to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>; we are not stumping in the Domain; we are in Parliament where Bills are passed, defeated or amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750828_senate_29_s65/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has taken all the heat out of any talk of <span class="highlight">election</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In discussing the Budget Papers for 1975-76 the Senate in fact is examining Labor’s second last Budget before an <span class="highlight">election</span> must be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year following the double dissolution I had to fight against dishonest advertisements which were placed by the Prime Minister, stating that only he had reduced inflation by one-third. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a false claim and it was proven to be false and dishonest soon after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They sought re-<span class="highlight">election</span> on these advertisements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I had the pleasure recently of travelling to Launceston to take part in a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is Australians who want the right to work who will tip this Government out just as they tipped out the Labor Party in the Bass by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, and they will reject the Prime Minister nationwide the same as they rejected him in the electorate of Bass when he went down to lend his support, the same as when he went to lend his support in the last Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span> when his Party did so well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The only <span class="highlight">election</span> Labor has done well in was the South <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> in which the Prime Minister was not allowed to appear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is interesting is that this represents a betrayal by the Government of a firm promise which was made before it came to government and before the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Never let those of us who had to fight the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972 forget what  Senator James  McClelland ‘s Party said in the little document it put out headed  Economics; It’s Time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is from Labor’s <span class="highlight">election</span> manifesto. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He will come into the Senate and, because we will give the Labor Party such a walloping in the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, we will bring in also a fourth candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surprise, surprise, there was a State <span class="highlight">election</span> coming up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750902_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the presentation of this Budget the Opposition claimed that there would be an elections-there was no doubt about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Parties were crying out for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They wanted an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They were going to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Senator Withers interjects and says: ‘Why do we not have an <span class="highlight">election</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers  on many occasions has threatened an <span class="highlight">election</span> but it seems now that the Opposition is not prepared- irrespective of the opinion polls which seem to be running against the Governmentto do that which they threatened before the Budget was presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the people who in 1972 felt that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor government would be the answer to their hopes and their dreams. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, I would be surprised if even one of the would-be home owners in this country were to vote for the Labor Party at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know about the situation in Launceston because we heard such a lot about it during the Bass by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I predict at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> a rejection of  Mr Whitlam  and his Party of a magnitude never before seen in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that <span class="highlight">election</span>, it is my belief that action will be taken to revive production and investment, to control government spending and to reduce personal taxation in order to get Australia on the road again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the third Budget which has been introduced since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of an Australian Labor Party government in 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party then had the idea of really causing havoc to the Budget and possibly forcing an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a real conclusion because it is a good conclusion: If an <span class="highlight">election</span> were to be held at the moment this Government would be wiped out of existence, and  Mr Whitlam  would go with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, which was not all that long ago, in May 1974, the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Government claimed that Australia had overcome the worst of its economic ills and was on the upturn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this country is wise enough and the Liberal and Country parties get back into government at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, we will see some confidence restored in the community and overseas, we will see an upsurge in private investment and in the industry and commerce of this country and I hope and pray that we will see a great downturn in unemployment, which is one of the greatest tragedies that this Government has inflicted upon Australia at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To this end, therefore, I should appreciate your advising me as soon as possible the names of three persons whom your party would be prepared to nominate for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of one of them by the parliament to fill the present casual senate vacancy . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was a candidate for the Labor Party at the Senate elections in 1970 and 1973 and at the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, recently he had published a book dealing with Senate elections, particularly the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think I have an obligation to let the people of this country know the circumstances of his selection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was certainly not an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the true sense of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was an exercise in which he engaged during the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when he required persons who had inserted advertisements in the newspapers protesting against the proposed laws on gun control to withdraw those advertisements, having used the Commonwealth Police and officers of the Attorney-General’s Department to indicate that action would otherwise be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There had been, as I think it was described, a Legislative Council until 1963, when the first <span class="highlight">election</span> was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the next couple of months  Senator Wright  will be out of this Parliament and in receipt of an age pension, so he will not have to worry about what Party is in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For the benefit of the Opposition senators who have just returned to the chamber, I point out that I was mentioning that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were precipitated in the next couple of months  Senator Wright  would not be back here because he would be on the age pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750904_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister not aware that  Mr Misha  Lajovic, who migrated in 1950 from Slovenia to Australia, is a Liberal Senate candidate for New South Wales and does he not occupy a position which is likely to ensure his <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite clear that the Government failed to restrain those rapidly rising wage costs; in fact it was the policy of this Government from the day of its <span class="highlight">election</span> to set the pace and to encourage the cost of wages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the honourable senator is talking about the misconception which arose during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when he was elected to Parliament, I think that if he studies the statement which was made he will get a different view of what was intended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also understand that Don Dunstan, who tried to wash his hands of the Federal Labor Government during the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, was anxious to get some money from overseas for his own purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750909_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is some difficulty facing individuals who formerly were Labor voters in trying to understand the plea of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> when he said: ‘Give us a chance ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I want to make a brief statement about the speculation concerning the possibility of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us and none of those who are so closely associated with this place can be so innocent as not to be able to recognise the momentum that is running within the Opposition parties for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The content of various speeches of members of the Opposition in the Senate can leave one with no other impression than that the Opposition is looking for the first spark that it can find to ignite the procedures that will lead to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The organisation of that profession and the individuals in it were greatly harmed in their own eyes by the procrastination of the Opposition and the failure of the Opposition to carry Australia with it in the <span class="highlight">election</span> following the double dissolution it caused. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am suggesting is that we might arrive at quite the opposite to what the Honourable Jim Killen was complaining about last year and that is a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has the authority to call an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate when it desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could well be that the normal machinery for an <span class="highlight">election</span> in November, or whenever is necessary, could be set in motion for half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition could find itself in the very undesirable circumstance of having to come back, with whatever component it received after an <span class="highlight">election</span>, to face the Budget or- in deference to  Senator Wright’s  complaint- whatever the individual measures were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, if the Government so misbehaves as to cause on the floor of the House a disintegration of its own support, then even on a procedural vote, according to the practice, if it fails by one vote to get a judgment of the House on a mere matter of procedure- which may be completely irrelevant to confidence, as in the Beasley case in 1 930- it is proper to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my political experience, if that had occurred to any government with a resolute parliament in previous days the party that had been so scattered to the 4 winds would have demanded a reconstitution of the Prime Ministership and therefore an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, though, we have such abysmal ignorance of the true basis of responsibility on the part of the Party to which the majority in the lower House is justified in according its confidence that we have it suggested that, far from that reconstruction being a matter for an <span class="highlight">election</span>, it is a matter for guaranteeing the new outfit the full term of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We go in any double dissolution situation and in this other contingency that the genius of  Senator Hall  has found, namely, a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are to have a set Parliament and if we are prepared to accept that the Government should remain in office for the term that it was appointed at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> we can deal with the matter in a much more favourable manner than otherwise would be the case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750911_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen a Press report in which the national director, I think he is called, of the Liberal Party of Australia,  Mr Eggleton,  accused the Australian Labor Party of generating <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation so that it could blame the Opposition for creating political instability? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>CANBERRA-The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Fraser)  yesterday started fresh speculation about an <span class="highlight">election</span> by carefully leaving his options open on rejecting Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In statements issued in Canberra yesterday  Mr Fraser  and the Senate Opposition Leader,  Senator Withers,  refuted  Mr Whitlam  ‘s description of the Opposition as ‘a pack of jackals hounding for an <span class="highlight">election</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calling  Mr Whitlam  a ‘pompous, arrogant, profane would-bc dictator’,  Senator Withers  said the only insurance against an early <span class="highlight">election</span> was good government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But while the nation speculates and politicians ponder on the possibility of an early <span class="highlight">election</span>, a tight-knit band of specialists is ready to serve up the Opposition Leader,  Mr Fraser,  to the people tomorrow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to prevent the Liberal and Country Parties from bringing down the wrath of the public servants and the pensioners upon their heads if an <span class="highlight">election</span> prevented those people from being paid over the Christmas period, he would offer the Government temporary Supply on the understanding that the Government held an <span class="highlight">election</span> early in the new year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he tries to bring on an <span class="highlight">election</span> and if he is successful he will say to the Government: ‘I will give you temporary Supply because 1 do not want to have the wrath of the pensioners, the public servants and whoever else depends on a pay cheque from the Government, because of their being deprived of the wherewithal to buy Christmas essentials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750930_senate_29_s65/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To depart from its 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that basic pensions would be related to average weekly earnings and never be allowed to fall below 25 per cent thereof, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister whether he can, on behalf of the Government, give the Senate a firm undertaking that if the Senate did not defeat any Supply or appropriation Bills the Government would not call an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives until the expiration of the maximum 3-year term for which it was elected in May 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively, does the Minister believe that the Government should be free to call an <span class="highlight">election</span> whenever it suits the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I indicated yesterday to  Senator Walsh  in my reply that the calling of an <span class="highlight">election</span> from the Government’s point of view, irrespective of what may take place in the Senate on refusal of appropriation Bills, is entirely a responsibility of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not in a position to say whether the Prime Minister would see fit to call an <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the important point is that the Prime Minister makes the decision, as  Senator Chaney  well knows, as to whether an <span class="highlight">election</span> should be called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Carrick  got them from his own secretariat there is no guarantee that they are reliable because  Mr Fraser  at the moment is relying on false, privately taken opinion polls in order to bolster his courage to see whether he will have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was only with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Country- Liberal Party Government in 1957 that a deliberate policy of expanding industry and of opening up mining areas so far as was possible was embarked upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although the Premier had no mandate from the people of South Australia to effect a transfer of the rural railways to the Australian Government, he used that request by the Liberal Party Opposition for the reference of the proposal to a select committee, which I believe was a quite logical request, as an excuse to hold a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results for South Australia, where 57 per cent of people favoured a Federal take-over of the railways, are particularly interesting because of the recent State <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was precipitated by this issue and which resulted in the return of Labor to power in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751001_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact that a party with approximately 50 per cent of the first preference vote is able to achieve office with a working majority at an <span class="highlight">election</span> held on the present boundaries shows that there is no basis for claiming that the electoral system is either unfair, unbalanced or biased in any party’s favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  said in his opening address in this debate, the evidence of the most recent elections in this country, percentage-wise and seat-wise, has suggested on 2 occasions in the last 3 years that a vote of slightly less than 50 per cent has produced a government in power with slightly more than 50 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely it would be far more sensible to introduce such legislation at a time when the census had revealed that a redistribution was necessary than to rush into a redistribution at this time which can, at best, serve perhaps only one <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian Labor Party supporters in the main would be quite happy about casting one vote for the candidate for whom they wanted to vote and with not being compelled to have to vote for every lunatic fringe candidate who enters into the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> before the last one something like- in round figures- 9000 votes were needed to elect a member of Parliament from the Liberal Party, something like 6000 votes were needed to elect a member of Parliament from the Country Party, and something like 14 000 votes were needed to elect a member of Parliament from the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> it had more than 40 members returned to the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Anthony  is the man who wants an <span class="highlight">election</span> for his own gain so that he will once again become the  Deputy  Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The real test of one vote one value is this: In an <span class="highlight">election</span> did a majority of voters elect a majority of members? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only exception was in the 1954 <span class="highlight">election</span>, the boundaries for which were drawn under the supervision of a Labor Minister,  Mr Calwell. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us pose this question against the background of an array of electoral Bills before the Parliament which are trying to wipe out Independents by raising the deposit for candidates at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is particularly so in relation to Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite impossible at any point of time to have at an <span class="highlight">election</span> a situation in which each seat has one vote one value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the Government hopes to ensure that at an <span class="highlight">election</span> the 127 seats will be so distributed that a majority of votes gives it a majority of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about whether boundaries for State elections were bad- whether they were boundaries in New South Wales under a Labor government, whether they were boundaries in South Australia under a Labor government or whether they were boundaries in Western Australia under a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the effect of the value of a vote in the country and compares it with the value of a vote in the city, one finds the simple fact is that in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> one country vote was equal to 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That harm will not be evident at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be evident at the <span class="highlight">election</span> thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at about that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely honourable senators will recall the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> on that occasion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strongly held Labor seats of previous elections, such as the seat now held by  Mr Burns,  who is the present Leader of the Labor Party, scraped home but not by very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is general agreement amongst the members of the Labor Government at the present time that if there were an <span class="highlight">election</span> today they would be decimated, just as they were decimated in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the members of the Labor Party who retained their seats after such an <span class="highlight">election</span> would be so scarce about this chamber that one would have to ask: Have you seen a Labor Party member of Parliament today?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite allege that the proposals are deliberately designed and concocted to keep Labor in power forever or to give Labor, at the very least, a grossly unfair advantage in any ensuing <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter what honourable senators opposite may say I believe that this is a blatant attempt by the Government to alter the way in which any future <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country would go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government will lose the Tasmanian seats, in this order: Wilmot, Braddon, Denison and Franklin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> the number of votes needed by the Opposition to capture Wilmot was only 3 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw what happened in the Bass by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in Bass Labor got about 37 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held tomorrow in Bass the Labor Party would get fewer votes than it did then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Labor Party will need to field a very good candidate to have any chance of holding that seat in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 on the Labor Party ticket for Tasmania at the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> I would be very worried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the way in which the electorate is going in Tasmania, I believe that at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> the swing in Tasmania will be such that it does not really matter how many Labor votes are transferred from Franklin to Denison. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that Denison was one of the most marginal seats after the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, and that is why I think the redistribution went the way it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislation was introduced and tested because the Opposition precipitated an <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that <span class="highlight">election</span> legislation was introduced into the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we put it to the people at an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1974 it was accepted by the people of Australia and it was accepted by the Joint Sitting of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This may give it a slight advantage in the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, but at the price of perpetuating an unfairly weighted electoral system and of protecting its often mischievous coalition partner against being cut down to a size more proportionate to its popular support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might add that honourable senators have talked about unsavoury traditions as if that is relevant to what happens in the future-  the use of electoral gerrymanders by the ruling party to ensure its re-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take it that  Senator Hall’s  interjection means that he does not always rely on  Mr Mackerras’  <span class="highlight">election</span> eve prognostications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> conducted recently in the Northern Territory Labor did not win one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose Labor had its Bill passed and there were equal electorates in Queensland and there was a swing there such as happened at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there was an electorate with, say, 100 people and 3 candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span>, and the first candidate got 35 votes, the second candidate 33 votes and the third candidate 32 votes, on first past the post or optional preferences voting the first candidate would be elected with 35 votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All of us have worked on booths on <span class="highlight">election</span> day and we know what a hard, long day it is and what it is like to go into the polling booth at 8 o’clock at night and scrutinise and then struggle home late. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I was saying was that the people who are precluded from voting on <span class="highlight">election</span> day by the fact that the booths close at 6 o’clock at night would alter the figures in that 10 per cent estimate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers also mentioned that the results of past elections have generally led to the party which recorded 50 per cent of the vote winning government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country parties also won 62 seats at that <span class="highlight">election</span>, yet their total vote was only 40.91 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it any wonder that they opposed the amendments to the redistribution provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which the Government brought down and which were passed at the Joint Sitting following the double dissolution elections in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said during the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and we repeated it during the subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that we would try to bring electoral fairness into the Australian system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, that was something that became available to the members of the defence forces upon the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government and the implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would be interested to hear from the Opposition members, who talk so freely about secret ballots in trade unions and the democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> of trade union officials -something with which I largely agree- when they are going to call for a secret ballot amongst the policy holders in these insurance companies about the use of their money to bring down the Government for which the majority of the policy holders voted. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Did the Leader of the Government in the Senate hear the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program  AM  today in which he said that the Government is prepared for an <span class="highlight">election</span> and in which the  President  of the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Hawke,  in his usual dulcet and endearing tones, said that the Australian Labor Party is not prepared for an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751014_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, how does the Leader of the Government in the Senate reconcile those past statements and actions with the cowardly attempts by the Government to avoid a proper <span class="highlight">election</span> if the present appropriations are voted against? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me assure him that, so far as I am concerned, if there has to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> it will be fought on the issues that concern the Australian people and not on the manoeuvrings that take place inside the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The constitutional authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, and upon his continued authority in the popularly elected House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not long after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government that honourable senators opposite set about deliberately to create the conditions which led to the double dissolution in early 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Opposition parties want to gain office by a devious trick, by capitalising on certain political trends that are taking place in this country without having any clearly identified policy with which to win an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first session of this Parliament after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government- from February 1973 to December 1973- there were 174 divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My friend  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack interjected earlier, when I was citing the number of divisions that have been held in the Senate since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government- the few that were won by the Government and the large number that were won by the Opposition- and asked about the number of Bills that the Senate has rejected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have heard so much from the Opposition about the Government having received from the people a mandate for the House of Representatives at the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span> but not having received a mandate for the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Opposition that when we were given a majority in the House of Representatives in May last year, at the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>, we received a greater number of votes for the Senate than the combined opponents of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I remember that during the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  was asked how he was going to finance a number of promises obviously involving vast sums of money he replied that he was going to finance them out of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Lynch replied: ‘No, we think we will keep it for an <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He knew it was to be used for the purpose of bringing about an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and it has now been exploded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will give the Senate power to decide that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the intention of the Opposition to take steps to force this Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately the Government agrees to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition will pass the Loan Bill and the Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have decided that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is in the best interests of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has forgotten- conveniently forgotten- that on 12 June 1970, when referring to the States Receipts Duties (Administration) Bill, he declared his Party would vote against the legislation in both Houses of the Parliament in a bid to force an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note that the Prime Minister is trying to avoid subjecting himself to the people by the device of a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> cannot resolve the crisis because of the 36 senators who would be elected 30 would not take up their seats until after 1 July 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I put this to the Senate and to the people: The Senate is not refusing supply; it is not rejecting the Budget, but it is demanding an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The moment the Prime Minister takes the only decent course open to him- the calling of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in which his Government can be tested at the polls- the flow of money will resume. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prime Minister announces the <span class="highlight">election</span> date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister has any sense of responsibility, any sense of decency, any sense of courage and any sense of honour, he will take the only course left open to him- he will agree to an <span class="highlight">election</span> at which the people can determine the fate of the Government and the fate of every person sitting in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the Senate are not fearful of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution provides the proper method for resolving the deadlock between the two Houses, that is, a dissolution under section 57 of both Houses of the Parliament and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On behalf of the Opposition, I call upon the Prime Minister to take the only honourable course, that is to resign his commission and allow an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the <span class="highlight">election</span> comes about he will be proven to be- I was going to say a big bag of wind but perhaps I should be more charitable- a man of complete indecision when the real crunch comes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can fight when he is in a corner, and if we must go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> over this legislation, let me assure the Opposition that it will see him fight as a leader and he will have a lot of good fighters behind him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to bring to the notice of the Senate 2 matters each of which I would suggest warrants the immediate resignation of the Whitlam Government and the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which is the right of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tonight on one of the television channels I saw an interview with  Mr Anthony  who said with gravity, without actually smiling, that if the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  did not hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> he would be breaking normal conventions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was interesting to note that at the Press Conference of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  today he was asked a question which went something like this: ‘This is the second time in 2 years that you have rejected money Bills in the Senate to force another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition would win an <span class="highlight">election</span> now - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the previous Leader of the Opposition was reducing the effect of the Liberal cause by threatening an <span class="highlight">election</span> every fortnight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> is something that none of us can forecast. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We understand that certain States will not respond to a call for a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will not collaborate with the Australian Government to have a normal half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> if it is called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, it is the normal time to have a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain States have not yet refused to respond to the call for a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and we are not faced with that problem at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is quite justified in having a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By having a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, it is seeking that answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that he has every reason to be worried because at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> I think that there was about 7 or 8 per cent difference between us in the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the rate of increase in votes for our party at each <span class="highlight">election</span> I expect that  Senator Young’s  party will some day be in the minority position in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eighteen months later we were forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> prior to which  Senator Withers,  the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We embarked upon a course some 12 months ago- I am not trying to be provocative- to bring about a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four months after the Labor Government was elected in Australia, a plan was embarked upon to bring about a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> by the use of Opposition numbers in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 4 months after the <span class="highlight">election</span> that course was embarked upon in what has been described and has gone down in history as a grab for power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party won the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a shocking state of affairs to think that we have a parliamentary society today which allows the will of the people expressed at a triennial <span class="highlight">election</span> to be flouted in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be accepted if an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held in the meantime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government there was a misplaced lack of confidence; on this occasion there is a misplaced confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note in relation to comments which have been made by members of the Opposition in condemnation of the Government for not having arrested inflation and unemployment that  Mr Wran,  the Leader of the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, challenged the Premier to an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the very ground on which the Federal Opposition is challenging the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is surprising, however, are the suggestions- at least some of which have been inspired by people close to  Mr Fraser-  that this funds shortage supplied the grounds and the vehicle for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But quite a deal of water will pass under the bridge between now and the day of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator asked me to make sure that there was not an <span class="highlight">election</span> before a certain time so that he would be in Parliament long enough to get his pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751015_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface it by referring to the reported remarks, published in today’s Press, by the Governor of Queensland,  Sir Colin  Hannah, in the course of which he supported Opposition moves to force a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, does  Sir Colin  Hannah’s publicly expressed partisanship for the Opposition’s cause cast doubt on his ability to exercise impartially his function under section 12 of the Constitution to issue writs for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators in Queensland? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why will the Government not turn over its power to the people who are the masters of us all and call an immediate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not the real difference that in 1970 and 1974 the Labor Party thought it could win an <span class="highlight">election</span>; today it does not? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why action was taken by the Opposition to put the Government before the people in an <span class="highlight">election</span> is the scandal and the comment that came out as a result of this loans deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those words mean that he would have had an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hall’s  remarks meant that he was pressing very strongly for us to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> between when he made his remarks and now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If at one stage, on 16 July,  Senator Hall  felt that this matter should be investigated further, even to the extent of having an <span class="highlight">election</span>, what has made him change his outlook now? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What  Senator Cotton  forgets is that that is not the question that is going to win the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures to which he referred, although he dealt with them in an orderly and expert way, are not going to win the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> was fought on obstruction in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A double dissolution was called because of the number of Bills the Opposition had obstructed in the Senate and the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> was that the Government was returned to office, which was quite contrary to what had been indicated by the gallup polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, because the gallup polls indicate that the Opposition would win an <span class="highlight">election</span>, it again seeks to go to the people in the hope that it will gain office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has indicated that this <span class="highlight">election</span> will be fought on the right of the Senate to reject the twice expressed opinion of the Australian electors and to become a dictatorship in its own right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> will be fought on the obstruction of that right and, whether one likes Labor or not, it is an issue that is in the forefront of people’s minds and they will vote accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My State has a Government which is in an unassailable position because it fought an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this very issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is the only section, other than section 57, which is concerned with the <span class="highlight">election</span> or retirement of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the double dissolution of the Menzies Government, and in my time in the Parliament there was the early <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1963 when the GovernorGeneral dissolved the House of Representatives and the 1974 double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be understood that the procedure which the Senate is following is the traditional procedure whereby in a bicameral legislature the second chamber brings about a general <span class="highlight">election</span> at which the government goes to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the accepted true fundamental convention of the Westminster system of responsible government that if a government cannot secure the approval of the Parliament of its Budget or money proposals with which to carry on the government, then the monarch is so advised and one of 2 consequences ensues: Either the monarch or the monarch ‘s representative calls upon another member of the Parliament to form a government in the belief that that new government will secure the approval of its Budget or monetary proposals; or the defeated Prime Minister is given the right to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> and, in a democracy, to let the people make the final decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pending an <span class="highlight">election</span>, Supply is afforded so that the <span class="highlight">election</span> can take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let it be clear that the Opposition’s purpose is to secure an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the Government does not choose to have a double dissolution, it may have an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it chooses, although senators will not take their seats in the Senate until next July, it is constitutionally empowered to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that time, there can bc an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> therefore would cause no disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The justification for what the Labor Party then did was that it believed that there ought to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> because the people would vote it in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It ought not to be overlooked that a refusal by the Senate to grant the money to enable the Government to govern must lead to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that no matter how much the Prime Minister procrastinates there must be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may wonder why it is that there is this curious reluctance to face an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that the Prime Minister virtually has a vested interest, particularly when he talks about holding a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at this stage when it is not necessary to do so until some time towards the middle of next year, in maintaining the chaos which is currently existing as a result of his Government’s indecisions and inabilities rather than giving the people an opportunity of deciding which of the two competing Parties should be able to govern in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The majority in the lower House may call an <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We offer this amendment so that the Government will know that the Appropriation Bills will not be debated and passed by this chamber until such time as the Government has had an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition and we hope that when that <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place, as it must, the verdict that the people give will be a verdict which gives either to the present Government a continuing mandate or to the Opposition Parties a mandate to ensure stability in government because when that <span class="highlight">election</span> is fought the basic and fundamental issue upon which people must make their vote is what sort of government they want in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time the considerations which I have been urging today and which others will be raising in the course of the next few weeks will become relatively unimportant because, as everyone will appreciate, when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is on it is the choice of government which becomes paramount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal which is being put by the Opposition is, in effect, that the Government which was elected twice within the last 3 years, should be subjected to a third <span class="highlight">election</span> within 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the traditions which we inherited from Europe, including the tradition of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of parliamentary government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751016_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to depart from its 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that basic pensions would be related to average weekly earnings and never be allowed to fall below 25 per cent thereof, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that time, there can be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> therefore would cause no disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with the parent Electoral Laws Amendment Bill itself, the proposals contained in these 6 Bills, taken as a whole, are designed to implement improved voting facilities; to provide more realistic and less cumbersome voting procedures which will assist electors to exercise their franchise effectively by the recording of valid votes; to permit a speedier finalisation of <span class="highlight">election</span> results and to reduce the scope for electoral malpractice in any guise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are aware, under the existing preferential system, each voter, irrespective of his or her individual wish, is compelled to rank in order of preference all the candidates on a Senate ballot-paper, even where this requires the sequential numbering of 73 squares, as was the case for the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate elections on 18 May 1974, the informal vote, Australia wide, averaged 10.77 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I incorporate in Hansard, for the benefit of honourable senators, a statement showing the percentage of informal votes recorded at the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">Election</span> in each State and in each electoral division throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, in a normal periodic Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the voter, in order to cast a formal vote would be required to mark his ballot-paper consecutively from 1 to 5, in his order of preference for the candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an <span class="highlight">election</span> following a dissolution of the Senate, the voter would be required to indicate his order of preference for only ten candidates, be there 73 or 173 candidates on the ballot-paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, supporters ofanypoliticalparty who wish to exchange preferences with the supporters of another political party contesting the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be free to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the optional preferential system proposed by this Bill a voter at a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> must indicate his first preference for one candidate and may indicate his further preference for some or all of the remaining candidates, as he so desires. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the extent that preferences beyond the first shown on the ballot-papers are required to determine the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, such preferences will be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that if all voters deliberately refrained from expressing any preferences beyond the first preference, the result under optional preferential voting in an <span class="highlight">election</span> for a member of the House of Representatives would be the same as in a firstpastthepost system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this is a hypothetical proposition which has not eventuated in elections under the optional preferential system in Australia in the past, nor is it likely to eventuate in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be said that the optional preferential procedure ensures that meaningful preferences are distributed whereas the present system can lead to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a candidate with a manufactured majority based on what may well be preferences randomly assigned by the voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) 1975, this is a non-partisan reform which is designed to introduce a system of voting which provides for the maximum flexibility and democratic freedom of choice for the voters while maintaining the essential elements of a full preferential system, should the voters choose to indicate preferences for all candidates in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general terms, to qualify, parties must endorse candidates for not less than one-quarter of the number of vacancies to be filled in the State at a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> or, in the case of a general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives, one-quarter of the number of Divisions in the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of casual vacancies in the Senate, or by-elections for the House of Representatives, the party must have met this test at the last preceding Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> or general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives, as is appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential purpose of the proposal to increase deposits is to reduce the number of persons who might be tempted or influenced to nominate for either Senate or House of Representatives elections for obstructive or frivolous reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This occurred in the 1974 Senate Eelections when an individual publicly admitted that he had sponsored a number of candidates in order to deliberately obstruct the Senate elections in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1974 Senate elections in New South Wales (when there were 73 candidates) and to a lesser extent the 1 974 Senate elections in certain other States, gave a clear indication of what might happen in the future unless a sufficient deterrent is introduced to operate against frivolous candidature or candidature designed to infringe upon, or obstruct, the democratic process of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation, which becomes more significant in a closely contested <span class="highlight">election</span>, would of course still obtain even where a draw was conducted to determine the order in which the candidates’ names appeared on the ballot-paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>limiting the provisions concerning the signing or authorisation of newspaper articles on the occasion of an <span class="highlight">election</span> to the period ending with the close of the poll in lieu of the period ending with the return of the Writ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>enabling the posting up or exhibiting within a hall used in connection with an <span class="highlight">election</span> or referendum an electoral poster irrespective of size. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To turn to a further reform proposed in this Bill, the Government believes that, given the present ineligibility of Members of State Parliaments to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Australian Parliament, it would be appropriate for a member of the legislature of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory to be placed in the same category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senators will be aware that in the past candidates have changed their names just prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the specific purpose of having the name placed above other candidates on the ballotpaper in order to gain some political advantage in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">Election</span> a number of persons enrolled under such names, including White Australia’ and ‘StopAsianImmigrationNow’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, the last in the series of Bills incorporating proposals previously contained in the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, provides for- a speedier finalisation of <span class="highlight">election</span> results, by introducing an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and by providing for the return of postal votes direct to the relevant Returning Officer; prohibition on the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in certain specified circumstances; restriction of postal vote application forms to be used at an <span class="highlight">election</span> or referendum to those specified by notice in the Gazette; postal voting facilities for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; discretion to appoint a licensed or registered surveyor as a Distribution Commissioner in lieu of the Surveyor-General of the State concerned; and other minor amendments to the existing electoral law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators are well aware, the present electoral system involves intolerable delays in finalising the <span class="highlight">election</span> results, particularly when a large number of postal votes is admitted to the Scrutiny as was the case in the 1974 House of Representatives Elections when almost 5 per cent of the total votes recorded throughout Australia were postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a growing tendency for party workers to take advantage of the existing provision which enables a person to examine postal vote applications in the office of a Divisional Returning Officer so as to compile a list of electors who voted by post at the <span class="highlight">election</span> and to use this list to forward postal vote applications to the persons concerned at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, without knowing whether those persons are still eligible to vote by post. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also proposed to give the Chief Australian Electoral Officer power to vary the form of postal vote applications at each <span class="highlight">election</span>, in order to prevent the dubious practice of stockpiling partially completed forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under this proposal the Chief Australian Electoral Officer will specify by a notice in the Gazette, the postal vote application forms which may be used at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I just wonder tonight if they are not a little rueful because if they had not beaten the gun in April 1974 they would have been facing an <span class="highlight">election</span> very soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>to depart from its 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that basic pensions would be related to average weekly earnings and never be allowed to fall below 25 per cent thereof, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were challenged in 1 974 and, despite all the comments which were made by the Opposition early in 1974 that this Government had lost the confidence of the people, the Opposition was defeated at that <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Government again was returned for another 3 year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the persistent claims by the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Fraser,  and his colleagues in this place that the Government should consult the people by way of an <span class="highlight">election</span> because there have been changes in the Whitlam Ministry, can the Minister say whether the Liberal and National Country Parties took the type of action they now advocate when, because of internal disputes within the Liberal Party,  Mr Gorton  was sacked and replaced by  Mr McMahon  on 1 0 March 1971? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no point in restoring these Bills to the notice paper until the Prime Minister agrees to a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister believes that there is a doubt, it can be resolved simply, quickly and properly by having an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only indication is that if the Budget is rejected he will seek a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it assists the Prime Minister to make up his- mind, to face the inevitable, I assure him of this: The Opposition has no intention of passing these Bills until the Prime Minister agrees to an <span class="highlight">election</span> which will resolve the current deadlock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that the Opposition will hold these Bills in the Senate until the Prime Minister agrees to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The payments, necessary to ensure an <span class="highlight">election</span> can be held, will be able to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that this deadlock must be resolved in the proper legal constitutional manner- the holding of a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will not be resolved by a so-called half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he genuinely wants the deadlock resolved, if he wants this so-called crisis that he has created brought to an end, if he wants to stop people suffering, he will decide on an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not just time for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a government of Australia, but for a parliament of Australia- an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the whole Parliament of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The market researchers were proved wrong yesterday, as they were 1 8 months ago and would be again in the event that  Mr Whitlam  decided to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>- and it is going to be  Mr Whitlam  ‘s decision, not the decision of the members of this Opposition who see themselves in the role of the God-given right to rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have had 2 very expensive elections since the beginning of December 1972 and now this irresponsible Opposition wants to see us go back and have another one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt that we have even been able to pay for the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, but already the Opposition is saying to the taxpayers of Australia: ‘Let’s have another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have plenty of money to put out our “how to vote” pamphlets and all our literature that is necessary with an <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The communications I am getting openly state that the people concerned do not necessarily support the Labor Party at electionsthat they may not have voted for the Labor Party at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>- but that they will not stand idly by and watch the Opposition in its attempts to gain control of the Government benches when we have a freely elected Government, twice freely elected government, already on those Government benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if the Government had been really responsible, at that stage and as a result of that <span class="highlight">election</span> it surely would have taken stock of its policies and attitudes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government says that it is the threat of an <span class="highlight">election</span> that is causing instability in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are to list all these items and say that in total they represent sufficiently grave reasons, for this House to tell the lower House to go out and have an <span class="highlight">election</span>, I simply do not understand the reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume they would not because the Minister was quoting from an <span class="highlight">election</span> talk given by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcom Fraser)  on 2 March 1975, in which he clearly set out the rules and the basis for the operation of Parliament and stressed the supremacy that needs to be exerted by Parliament and the stability that we need to obtain from it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might ponder also that a normal general  <span class="highlight">election</span> would have been due in December had they not unwisely sought a premature return to power last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one in the community will start an argument if we are to approach an <span class="highlight">election</span> under crisis circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can get out of it in 2 ways- by giving in or ultimately by bringing this country to its knees and forcing an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Opposition continues on this course which will bring this country to its knees economically, it could well produce in this community at some stage in the not too distant future conditions under which there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> which the Government will win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think anybody gave one iota of credence last Monday to the thought that the Labor Party could win any <span class="highlight">election</span> in the next 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, and I would say this with unfeigned respect for the vice-regal office, I think it would be a singular piece of impertinence on the part of the Prime Minister to go to the Governor-General, whose reputation is high, and who understands these things very well, and ask him for a premature ‘half Senate’ <span class="highlight">election</span>, calculated and designed, hopefully, because of the recent legislation about senators from the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, to give the Government control of the Senate for a month or two, in which time, of course, all their legislation which now has been attacked in the Senate, could be carried, with permanent (and I think damaging) effects on the Australian political structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, and upon his continued authority in the popularly elected House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party has drifted into disaster on this occasion for precisely the same reason as it drifted into disaster in April 1974- because the Leader of the Liberal Party then and the Leader of the Liberal Party now were not sufficiently astute to resist the urgings of the Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  to force a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me put it this way: The Leader of the National Country Party- who of course above all fears a just redistribution which would decimate his political power base- in common with  Senator Withers  and one or two others, has never accepted the verdict of the people at either the 1972 or 1974 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, from the point of view of the Leader of the National Country Party it seems an attractive proposition that at any time when it appears that the Opposition may be able to seize power it should force an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This power-hungry Richmond bushranger has again tricked or seduced the Liberal Party into trying to force a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> in order to make him  Deputy  Prime Minister, knowing full well that if it fails the blame, the stigma will accrue not to him but to the Leader of the majority Party in the coalition, the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the percentage changes in the consumer price index from the December quarter of 1949- which I interpolate was immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the MenziesFadden Liberal-Country Party Governmentand trace them through to the end of June 1952- the same period as the period for which the present Government has been in office, from December of one year to June  2y2  years later- we find that the total increase in the consumer price index in that period under a Liberal-Country Party government was 42.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we take from the figures the highest 12-monthly or annual rate of inflation recorded in any period, we find that for the year ended December 1951 the annual increase in the consumer price index was 23.1 per cent, and the highest increase in recent times, since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Whitlam Government, was 16.6 per cent for the year ended March 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the really ludicrous aspect of  Senator Rae’s  pathetic attempt to present this in terms of a States rights dispute or a States rights argument is that  Senator Rae  has aligned himself with a course of action the purpose of which is to force a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> and, the Opposition hopes, bring in a Fraser Government- a Fraser Government which recently announced a new federalism policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall not go into this in any great depth, but just to set the record straight for the benefit of  Senator Carrick  and the people who read  Hansard,  when the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was held 29 Labor senators were elected, one Independent, one Liberal Movement-  Senator Hall-  28 members of the Liberal and Country Parties and one member ofthe National AllianceSenator Drake-Brockman from Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequent to their <span class="highlight">election</span>, and as a breach of faith with the people who had elected them,  Senator Drake-Brockman  joined the Country Party, subsequently called the National Country Party, and  Senator Townley  joined the Liberal Party, which gives the Opposition its current number of 30. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, and I would say this with unfaigned respect for the Vice Regal office, I think it would be a singular piece of impertinence on the part of the Prime Minister to go to the Governor General, whose reputation is high, and who understands these things very well, and ask him for a premature ‘Half Senate’ <span class="highlight">election</span>, calculated and designed, hopefully, because of the recent legislation about Senators from the Capital Territory and Northern Territory, to give the Government control of the Senate for a month or two, in which time, of course, all their legislation which now has been attacked in the Senate, could be carried, with permanent (and I think damaging) effects on the Australian political structure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will avoid the further possible inconvenience to electors of a later <span class="highlight">election</span>, will permit the referendum proposals to be put as already determined, and will of course result in the saving of considerable public expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also worth at least half a minute to comment on any suggestion of a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister appears to be running from this suggestion now but everybody in Australia who has ever taken any notice of any of his speeches in an <span class="highlight">election</span> will know that the Prime Minister adheres to the point of view that elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate should be at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a principle which he forgets about when he talks of calling a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> this year and afterwards to let us see what happens’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have a situation where the Government cannot, in the Prime Minister’s own words, pretend to be able to govern, where it has been provided with the grounds more than 20 times to call an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and yet still it chooses to ignore the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The act which the Opposition is perpetrating in this House is the deferring of Supply in an attempt to force this Government to go to its third <span class="highlight">election</span> in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wonder how we will recover from the bitterness and the disillusionment that is produced by the certain knowledge that we all have now that if a Labor government wins an <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country the conservatives in the Opposition will do everything they can to have that Labor government out within months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will be a candidate for the Senate and failing that I will stand as an independent at the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That needs reading into the record for the Australian public and in order to clear up the confusion, the misstatement of fact, the hysteria and to get away all the rubbish with which this quite simple issue- that is to have or not to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>- is being confused and confounded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear that every time the Liberals have a blood bath in their own party and a change of leadership they want a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Snedden replaced McMahon and then sought an <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was asked from where he got the message that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cotton is advocating here tonight that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> every 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be outrageous if a Government, whenever it took such a hard decision, could be forced into an <span class="highlight">election</span> at the whim of minor parties in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disastrous effect would not be that there would be many elections but rather that hard but necessary decisions would not be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we find people like Anthony and Fraser going to the people and saying that we should have an <span class="highlight">election</span> because there have been some minor changes in this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By flouting the will of the people in the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span> and in the second <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974 and by moving this amendment the Opposition is taking undemocratic action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I replied that without having had a close look at it, it was the type of Budget I expected; it was a Budget in accordance with the mandate given at 2 elections; it was a Budget in accordance with the thinking of the Government on the form of government it wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He further pointed out that it was not within the power of the House of Representatives to force the Senate to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that the electoral sanction will not, unless there is a double dissolution or an impending half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, be likely to affect the Senate at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it is suggested that non-Labor Premiers may not respond to a Government initiative to call out only half the Senate, and may refuse to issue writs for such an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strategically, our non-Labor side of politics must surely be better served by planning to win a significant number of years of office at a normal <span class="highlight">election</span> rather than by prejudicing the length of that office by grabbing at 16 or 17 months of Labor’s remaining term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that Supply should be granted and that a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> should be proceeded with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes to prove that the mandate which was given to this Government as a result of the promises made prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> has been carried into effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751022_senate_29_s66/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Prime Minister in 1974, at just a threat from the Senate to stop supply, rush to a double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>, yet under almost identical circumstances this time, with the actual delaying of Supply, the Prime Minister finds the excuse of a very great constitutional question to prevent his going to an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this occasion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the reason for the difference in opinion is that in 1974 the Prime Minister felt that the Government had a chance of re-<span class="highlight">election</span> but that on this occasion he feels that the Government will be decimated if he goes to the country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, is it not a fact that despite the claims about the great return of the Government at the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government was returned in the House of Representatives with a reduced overall majority, and with very small majorities in some electorates, and that in this Senate, which was elected by the same electors, the Government did not secure a majority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not hear that people outside the Parliament were making considerations as they did with respect to the possibility of a normal <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Senate, which is due to take place before June 1 976, and how the Federal Council of the Liberal Party in fact gave the riding instructions to the four anti-Labor conservative Premiers to deny certain elementary facilities for the purposes of holding normal Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is significant also that prior to that decision having been made by this great man of principle,  Mr Fraser,  and prior to honourable senators opposite meeting and making their decision, the Liberal and Country Parties had in fact booked space on all the television and radio stations throughout Australia in the expectation that an <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held between now and Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party was confronted with the likelihood of an <span class="highlight">election</span> taking place it endeavoured to make some bookings on television and radio stations in order to present the policy of the government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides for an <span class="highlight">election</span> every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence to suggest that the people want an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we heard the stupid statements he made about petrol prices and for which he traduced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the newspapers, economists and people generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that there ought to be an <span class="highlight">election</span>, that this House of review ought to make the running in relation to this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One only has to reflect that if they had not been so impatient in April and May of 1974 in acting on their judgment that the electorate was against the Government, then it would have been a lay-down misere for them to have had the <span class="highlight">election</span> which would normally have taken place in a month’s time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, and except for the most improbable circumstances, neither the American Senate nor the American House of Representatives, can make or break a government; only the people can do this, every four years at a Presidential <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be very rarely that a Liberal senator or a Country Party senator, or a Labor senator, would feel himself free to vote against giving effect to a measure propounded by his own party in the House of Representatives after a general <span class="highlight">election</span> at which his party had been chosen, perhaps by a large majority, to carry on the government of Australia on the basis of its electoral policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Otherwise a Senate opposition whose party had just been completely defeated at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, would be in command of the government of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister confirm last Friday’s newspaper report that public servants have been required to work overtime recently in order to draw up, as a matter of urgency, a list of Government achievements, apparently in anticipation of a federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is one of the reasons why  Mr Dunstan  put on the Pontius Pilate act during the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and washed his hands of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is deferring further consideration of them all until the Government has indicated that it will, as the Opposition believes it should, present itself to the people in a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the earliest possible opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the Government will have some explaining to do to the Australian people in due course, when it presents itself to the people at a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that amendment the Opposition makes some assertions and calls on the Government to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a reflection upon the present Government’s standards that it made great claims in its <span class="highlight">election</span> platform that this would be a change which would be brought about when it came into government, but there has been no change whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>denounces the blatant attempt by the Senate to violate section 28 of the Constitution for political purposes by itself endeavouring to force an early <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751028_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, in which the Opposition has a majority, has now failed to pass the Supply Bills as a means of forcing a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, a power conferred upon the Senate by the Constitution for that very purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The necessity for the Queen or her ministers, that is the present government, to come to Parliament every year to ask for money is the great democratic check which means, and was intended to mean, that if a government has lost the confidence of either House of Parliament it can no longer govern and an <span class="highlight">election</span> must ensue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Opposition, deciding that revulsion of opinion has prejudiced its chances at an <span class="highlight">election</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the height of irresponsibility for the Senate to demand an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the people’s House just because it feels that the popularity poll is in the Opposition’s favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, as everybody knows, the fine point of deferral as opposed to rejection and I repeat that if rejection were to be persisted with, what guarantee has the Parliament that an <span class="highlight">election</span> would follow? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could very well withhold the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would have its Budget rejected and could leave it rejected until after an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Prime Minister would then stand as someone ready and prepared to cause hardship and confusion to hurt people and to cause shortages until he gave an <span class="highlight">election</span> assurance- and as I am speaking he has not given any assurance- that there would be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By that time there can be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> therefore would cause no disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is just another reason why the Prime Minister should provide the people of Australia with the opportunity of going to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Constitution does not give the Senate the right to demand an <span class="highlight">election</span> each year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They demanded an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1974 because they were addicted to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They lost the <span class="highlight">election</span> and shortly after that in their hallucinatory state or period of remorse they sacked their then leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the Senate numbers as a result of the 1 974- last year’s- Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time as the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> there was also a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> 29 Government senators, 29 Liberal Party senators, one Liberal Movement senator and one independent senator were elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that dme, at that <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition was not given a mandate to govern in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the mass of the people speaks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 the Government was reasonably confident that with the economic crisis that was going to develop it was better for it in many ways to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> at that stage than for it to have to sit through the economic crisis and uncertainty of the future months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that time, there can be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is only one main issue in this debate and controversy and that is whether the Budget ought to be used as commodity of ransom to force the public to accept an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Government to agree to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely he can remember that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in that environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether  Senator Young  or anyone else in his Party would give an undertaking that if the Opposition were to have this <span class="highlight">election</span> and lost, it would not yet again in 18 months’ time call for the same action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party wants an <span class="highlight">election</span> not for the greater good of this country but so that it can get into office and its leading spokesmen can be Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My recollection- I am sure it is the recollection of every honourable senator here- was that the then Leader of the Opposition asked on a Wednesday that the Prime Minister should consider taking the Senate and the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the people made a decision inside the terms of the Constitution and awarded to the Senate a supervisory power from the time of that <span class="highlight">election</span> to the present day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>More recently, and shortly after his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the leadership,  Mr Fraser  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fraser had even said that the Governor-General had already made up his mind, and was going to ask Whitlam to call an <span class="highlight">election</span>: which, of course, was irresponsible rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate succeeds in imposing its will on the House of Representatives then future governments, whatever their political principles, could be forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> every six months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party says: ‘Stand and deliver us an <span class="highlight">election</span> because the gallup polls seem to suggest that we might win it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That minute was initiated a few days after the anniversary of Pearl Harbour when the Labor Party was slaughtered in Queensland at a State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the system of one vote one value was operating at that <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Party would not have one member in the Queensland Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They are now in the position where they are salting a few shillings away each week- not like they were previously when they were hanging on every <span class="highlight">election</span> and were given a pittance of 50c just prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in an attempt to bribe them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then we remember the people who pay the bills when it comes to <span class="highlight">election</span> time and we know why they want to remove such legislation as the Trade Practices Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we wonder where are all these people who the Opposition tells us are demanding that we have an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is on written record, by letters to the GovernorGeneral, saying that it is the constitutional duty of a government denied Supply to go to the Governor-General and get an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did, and I was delighted to learn that if we had had an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the day on which the Morgan gallup poll was taken the Labor Party would have been wiped out in a landslide, that it would have polled 43 per cent of the vote and that we would have polled 50 per cent plus of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where is the evidence that the people of Australia or any reasonable majority of them require an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the typical remark of the political brigand who simply says: ‘I say that there ought to be an <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If, fortuitously, there were to be a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in, shall we say, February or March, the procedure of section 57 would be impossible of application. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that honourable senators opposite are going to retain their excited state for a while under the impetus of the Prime Minister’s wonderful acting ability, but I suggest to them that they ought to give greater consideration to the problems of Australia and the matters which have led Opposition senators to take the course of refusing to proceed with the Budget Bills until an <span class="highlight">election</span> is called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government were to succumb to the pressures of the Opposition it would be presenting to the Australian people the third <span class="highlight">election</span> in 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Menzies  had used every device, every trick and every opportunity to change <span class="highlight">election</span> dates, to go to the people at times which he considered to be politically advantageous to him and to change the normal timetable of the House of Representatives and Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those editorials said that the loans affair was the issue and was the reprehensible circumstance that ought to be grasped by the Opposition to bring about an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us face it; that was one of the issues upon which we fought an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is good to see that even the newspapers, which were in the forefront of the campaign to defeat this Government and to force it to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in December of this year, are now forced to put on their front pages details of the result of public opinion polls which justify the principal position that the Australian Government has taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from confirmation of the arrangements for <span class="highlight">election</span> of the composition of the Assembly the recommendations dealt with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable senator that the Australian Government will continue to govern under the mandate that it has been given by the Australian people until such time as the normal general <span class="highlight">election</span> comes around again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government: Has the Prime Minister come around to your view, as reported in the media the week before last, that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives this year and not next year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, and as time is running out to hold such an <span class="highlight">election</span>, when will the announcement be made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, to prevent the Liberal and Country Parties from bringing down the wrath of the public servants and the pensioners upon their heads if an <span class="highlight">election</span> prevented those people from being paid over the Christmas period, he would offer the Government temporary Supply on the understanding that the Government held an <span class="highlight">election</span> early in the new year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deal that he is offering the Prime Minister now is that if the Prime Minister gives an undertaking to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> before June next year he will let the Budget through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By that time, there can be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> therefore would cause no disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that when we have an <span class="highlight">election</span> we determine and elect a government for 3 years- but this is not provided for in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its own way is to demand of the House of Representatives- not this chamberthat it should go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party, the Liberal Premiers, Liberal Opposition leaders and the senior members of the Liberal Party met at the weekend and pulled away from their position by announcing that they would allow the Appropriation Bills through providing the Prime Minister gave them an assurance of a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> before next June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe he was going to do it last year, but it appears to me that the Opposition has held the Government to ransom for an <span class="highlight">election</span> immediately but has now backed off and said: ‘Give us a half <span class="highlight">election</span> and hold it before next June, if you like’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> before 30 June and there will be an opportunity then for the people to judge the Budget but it cannot be judged until it has been passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974 the Australian Labor Party gained approximately 200 000 more votes than the Liberal and Country parties senators who sit opposite us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a motion to the effect that the Senate should withhold supply until such time as the Government has agreed to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He became a senator before the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Senator Reid  was appointed here, obtaining an advantage -by not having to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had that been done here; had the same decency been shown by  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  as was shown by  Mr Tonkin;  had the same respect for democratic traditions and conventions been shown by  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  as was shown by  Mr Tonkin  when  Mr Tonkin  had much more reason not to follow the conventions because it was quite obviously a ploy that was being followed by the Country Party whereas in fact our former colleague,  Senator Milliner,  died while he was in office; and had  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  followed tradition, the Opposition would not have had the majority to enable them to carry a resolution that the Budget be deferred until such time as we had undertaken to hold this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do we not have an <span class="highlight">election</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that if a government is elected for a 3-year term it is completely improper and completely undemocratic that an undemocratically constituted Upper House should be able to pick the time for that government to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  it was foreshadowed that moves would be made to licence overseas and interstate travel agents operating in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Prime Minister confirm last Friday’s newspaper report that Public Servants have recently been required to work overtime in order to draw-up, as a matter of urgency, a list of Government achievements, apparently in anticipation of a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751104_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-55-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To depart from its 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that basic pensions would be related to average weekly earnings and never be allowed to fall below 25 per cent thereof, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we protest at the Opposition’s campaign to force a General <span class="highlight">Election</span> by their decision to prevent the passage of Supply Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your Petitioners humbly pray that the Opposition will allow the passage of the Supply Bills and cease their campaign for a General <span class="highlight">Election</span> forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-0-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Owing to manoeuvres which have taken place outside the Senate even the original number of 29 honourable senators which we had following the <span class="highlight">election</span> and which we gained owing to the idiosyncrasies of the electoral laws of this country has been reduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although in the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> we polled some 200 000 votes more than our opposing parties, we received less than a majority in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, we even find the most comical situation now of the Leader of the Opposition in the other place as he finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into the mire saying that if we will have an <span class="highlight">election</span> some time before the middle of next year he will let the Budget go through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, it was confronted as a result of the 1 974 <span class="highlight">election</span> with the possibility- indeed, the ultimate probabilityof a deadlocked Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely that sort of re-<span class="highlight">election</span> should have been accepted by a responsible government as a real measure of reflection on its performance and as an indication that the Government had better take considerable heed of its policies and attitudes and sharpen up its performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this was not a measure of stern warning then I fail to interpret the result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> which saw a government returned with a lesser majority in one House, and being unable to control the house of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of motion add -  but not before the Government agrees to submit itself to the judgment of the people at the same time as the  forthcoming  Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Senate being of the opinion . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We embarked on a course some 12 months ago- I am not trying to be provocative- to bring about a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that that was before the Opposition moved the motion which had the effect of deferring Supply until such time as an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an article which appeared in the  Australian  on 19 October 1973, he said:  1 have made my attitude quite clear, that refusal of Supply to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> is not the Senate ‘s right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he wait for 3 years before he came out and called an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite recently, a matter of some 4 months ago, the present Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  chose to take his Government to the electors approximately 10 months before he ordinarily would have had to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He accepted- though as he said at the time, he did not like the course being followed- the consequences of what was being done and so he sought an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there can be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> would therefore cause no disruption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The plain fact is that where there is in the Parliament an Opposition which has power which it may lawfully and legitimately use, it has the right to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Senate forces an <span class="highlight">election</span> which the people do not want, those who have forced that <span class="highlight">election</span> will suffer as a consequence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of what the Senate is doing is to force an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not an example of the old truism that the people who oppose elections are the people who fear elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  is opposing an <span class="highlight">election</span> because he fears the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly feel that if the Bill is to be defeated and as a consequence thereof there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span>, that certainly should be the course that is followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I have not understood the Prime Minister to say that if the Senate, instead of deferring the Bill until an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, were to reject it outright he would have an <span class="highlight">election</span> forthwith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, when the money supply is cut off by the Parliament, the ultimate recourse is an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, pending the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Parliament accommodates the government of the day by ensuring that necessary finances are available for the requisite period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Opposition employed its numbers in this place to pull on an <span class="highlight">election</span> in which it was subsequently defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will happen again at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not going to adopt the bravado stand that  Senator Greenwood  did in which he seemed to indicate that he thought that in the event of an <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition would win and the Government would be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was asked on television 3 months ago, when the surveys showed the Labor Government to be in a very serious position, whether we would win the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But an <span class="highlight">election</span> fought on this fundamental issue is one which the Australian people will understand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the issue on which the Australian people would decide an <span class="highlight">election</span>, I believe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time for decision as to whether or not the people support the present Government is at the time of a normal <span class="highlight">election</span> and that, I would say, is towards the end of next year or perhaps the beginning of 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffice it to say at this stage that the Opposition is using the mechanism of the Constitution to force the Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And an <span class="highlight">election</span>, because the Government is not prepared to introduce the Mathews Committee recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>denounces again the blatant attempt by the Senate to violate section 28 of the Constitution for political purposes by itself endeavouring to force an early <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In determining whether to follow it or not he should have regard, amongst other things, to the time that has elapsed since the last General <span class="highlight">Election</span> of the House of Representatives, the state of the parties in each House, the probable consequences of refusal of the advice tendered by his Ministers, and, in particular, whether their resignation would follow the refusal, and, if so, whether there is any reasonable probability that another administration could be formed in the existing Parliament which would be able to carry on efficiently the functions of Government without dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751106_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer to that is yes, does the Minister realise that many of these people, because of high taxable incomes, in fact would be working for a little over $ 1 an hour, based on the amounts paid at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751111_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is making a sham and a farce of the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> to this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#debate-10">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator WEBSTER (Victoria-Minister for Science)- I, of course, am delighted to congratulate  Senator Tom  Drake-Brockman on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not go unmarked on this side of the chamber that a couple of the rivals that you had for your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Presidency of the Senate,  Mr President- Senator Young  and  Senator Davidson-  had the good grace to stand in their places and to compliment and to congratulate you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760217_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the question in light of the very great public support which exists for the continuation of legal aid services and in light of the suggestion that was floating around before the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal-National Country Party government would mean the abolition of legal aid services in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister for Education whether he is aware of allegations made during the recent Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign by parliamentary and other members of the Australian Labor Party that it was the intention of the Liberal Party to abolish tertiary allowances and to re-introduce tertiary fees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the credit of those who rule the People’s Republic of China and to Chou En-lai particularly that, on his <span class="highlight">election</span>, the new Australian Prime Minister in one of the first public statements that he made dealt with the area of foreign affairs and stated that he intended to visit the People’s Republic of China to see for himself the progress that has been made and to establish the normal and proper relationship that should exist among all countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, may I begin by congratulating you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> as  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate other honourable senators on their <span class="highlight">election</span>, particularly those who, like myself, are taking their places here for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although my Party-the Liberal Party of Australia expressed reservations about the constitutionality of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators for the Territories it has accepted the ruling of the High Court of Australia on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take this opportunity to suggest that, since the constitutionality of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Territorial senators has now been established, one further matter in this respect might be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also take the opportunity to extend my congratulations to you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also take the opportunity to congratulate my good friend the  Chairman  of Committees,  Senator Tom  Drake-Brockman, on his <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until now, with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government, it appeared that our defences were eroding away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are unique because of the manner in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1975 was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not accept the manner in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was brought about and it will continue to explain to the Australian people the wrongness of what was done and the inherent dangers which those actions have brought to the Australian parliamentary system, in the hope that the Australian people will recognise that there must be constitutional changes in this country which would prevent any political party ever again bringing about the event that we saw last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall quite clearly that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Fraser  referred to the dismissal of certain Labor Ministers because allegedly they were not telling the truth or there was something improper about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose it is unfair to be too critical after a government has been in office for 2 months and I will not suggest that everything that was promised or the undertakings which were made by Government spokesmen before the <span class="highlight">election</span> should have all been implemented by now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Were they told that before the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commitment given by the now Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during the course of the recent general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign is another case in point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other matter with which I am concerned is the general one of commitments which were made by the Government spokesman on primary industry,  Mr Sinclair,  during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like- although I have done it privately- to congratulate you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A philosophical commitment made plainly obvious in every <span class="highlight">election</span> is that Australia stands for small businesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer honourable senators to the Liberal Party policy which was announced during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Governor-General suggested was that the Whitlam Government should undertake to him that he should convey to  Mr Fraser  a proposition that we have a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> but that it would not call the Senate together until 1 July of this year and therefore would not attempt to gain any adventitious advantage about all of the things that were speculated upon at that time when it was said that we might have an accidental majority until 1 July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the members in the pits have finished, I would like to proceed to formally congratulate you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the high office which you hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not have a continuation of what was an extremely unsuccessful <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign; rather, let us have people considering whether any form of constitutional reform is necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a time that was not of our choosing, we again went to the people in December 1 975 following dismissal by the Governor-General, and it was inevitable that we could not win that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had the <span class="highlight">election</span> imposed upon us, as it were, by royal decree. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly the <span class="highlight">election</span> was held at a time when it would have been most difficult for the government in office, irrespective of its political persuasion, to win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that the Labor Government had had Supply already appropriated to it by the Australian Parliament; that if the Parliament had not been prorogued on that day, 1 1 November, it would have been virtually impossible to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975; and that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were to be held at all it would have had to be held over until 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as making the final arrangements for the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975 was concerned, the D-day was Tuesday, 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice given to us was that the D-day for the announcement of a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> or any other Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was Tuesday, 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were to be held in 1 975 the announcement had to be made by Tuesday, 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those who wanted the <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held in 1975- last year- had to act and to act quickly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He must have known also, as we were advised, that if the <span class="highlight">election</span> was to be held in 1975 the Government had to be dismissed by Tuesday, 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great tragedy about all of this- I mention this particularly because we are addressing our remarks this evening to the words of the Governor-General when he delivered his Speech from this chamber yesterdayis that a very large number of the Australian people who always have believed so fervently in the principle of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of members to the Parliament are very rapidly losing faith in the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind the Senate what happened: An <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972; a double dissolution in 1974; success at the double dissolution in 1974 in another place; at least equal numbers in the Senate at that <span class="highlight">election</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were carried away with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal-National Country Party Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard a lot about dole bludgers during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only remind the Opposition that  Mr Whitlam,  as Leader of the Labor Party, spent quite a deal of time during the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign discussing these very issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party was jolly near decimated at the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators opposite that in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1974 the Whitlam Government was returned to office with a marginal majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, the Labor Party got back into power marginally in the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had an <span class="highlight">election</span> and we have seen the results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the declaration of the poll in South Australia, it is a pity that a coalition which might have won the support of the people in an ordinary <span class="highlight">election</span> at the proper time had to have recourse to that sort of device. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would not have minded if we had been defeated in an <span class="highlight">election</span> that had been properly called under the parliamentary system in Australia, but under it there is no power to recall the members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that prior to the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> the then Opposition, in concert with the people who backed it- the great vested interests in Australia and the Press monopolies- had set out to destroy the Labor Government because the Labor Government was catching up on the need to make great welfare reforms in particular, to change the face of Australia and to give Australia a new image in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me first of all congratulate the  President,  in his absence, on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to his high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He does not often have to blow the whistle but when the politicians get into an awful mess he blows the whistle and dissolves the Parliament and sends the government to an <span class="highlight">election</span> to let the people decide’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services been drawn to an <span class="highlight">election</span> letter written on 4 December 1975 by a  Mr E.  Costanzo on behalf of the former Minister for Northern Australia,  Mr Paul  Keating? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that irrespective of which side of the chamber the member or senator came from, these envelopes ought not to be used during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns for electioneering purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that honourable senators and members on both sides in both chambers have the advantage of incumbency during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in being able to use free telephones, secretaries supplied at taxpayers ‘expense and office accommodation supplied at taxpayers’ expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after the December <span class="highlight">election</span> the Prime Minister advised the Australian Journalists Association that journalists formerly employed in the Department of the Media need not be concerned about their future with the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can talk and have our views about the reserve power that the Queen’s representative should have, but nobody has been able to give me any information that at any stage the Queen’s representative said to the then Prime Minister ‘  Mr Prime  Minister, despite the eyeball to eyeball action that has gone on between you and the Leader of the Opposition, if some decision is not reached I will have to dismiss you- period’, the implication being that the then Prime Minister would have gone to a very vital national <span class="highlight">election</span> not as the Prime Minister but as the Leader of the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to congratulate  Senator DrakeBrockman  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the ex-Prime Minister was sacked and he was sacked because he would not call an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> was obviously necessary because of the impasse that had developed in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate was satisfied that the Government was acting without the support of the Parliament or the people, and the Senate’s view was vindicated at the subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would expect that there should be some justification for the manner in which a government which was elected for 3 years was subjected to re-<span class="highlight">election</span> after serving 18 months in office and, after getting a second mandate from the people found that after another short period it again had to face the people as a result of an action which I have described as being contrary to the Constitution of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that his reuniting with their families at Christmas 1972 the kids who were held in the gaols of Australia because they were acting in accordance with their conscience would have justified a longer term in office than he had had when he was forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign those people who thought about the question rallied to the Labor cause with greater enthusiasm than has ever before been seen in politics in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s record, despite the enthusiasm of the reception it had received, the media in Australia decided who was going to win the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot have again a democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> unless there is more industrial action and the false stories of the journalists are not printed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could be said: ‘We will give some amount for your services in this <span class="highlight">election</span>’, and  Senator Webster  can justify that because it might have been done in the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact cannot be avoided that people outside a particular political party were paid to enter this <span class="highlight">election</span> for the purpose of purchasing votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stage was reached where the hope of those involved in the trade union movement was that we could reach a position where with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor government we would be able to achieve peacefully what we had to achieve by industrial action on the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Labor Party held a ballot for <span class="highlight">election</span> to shadow ministry positions, the question arose whether I would stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On other occasions with respect to secret ballots, we have heard it suggested that organisers would go on a Sunday morning to trade union members who have received their ballot papers and say: ‘You are not interested in voting in the <span class="highlight">election</span>, are you? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say ‘unresolved’ because I believe, as I think all honourable senators on this side of the chamber maintained throughout the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that the <span class="highlight">election</span> was not some type of referendum on the future of the Constitution or of the rights of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read with that statement the opening part of the social welfare policy of the joint parties at the recent <span class="highlight">election</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A great deal of consideration has been given to this matter before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and after it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I should like publicly to congratulate  Senator Laucke,  who is not in the Chair, on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I vividly remember his demonstrating his courage in this place not long before the <span class="highlight">election</span> when he defended his old friend and political colleague,  Sir Thomas  Playford, from the insults and the innuendoes of the then Leader of his own Party, the now Leader of the Government  (Senator Withers). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, I congratulate  Senator Tom  DrakeBrockman on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the big majority which the Government has in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, what  Senator Steele  Hall predicted after the <span class="highlight">election</span> will come true- this chamber will go to sleep. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The events that led to the <span class="highlight">election</span> did not surprise some of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The worst effect of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and of what has happened is that more and more groups in the community and more and more people in the community believe that Parliament just does not hold the answer to their justifiable aspirations or their desires to achieve various aims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cowardly action in the <span class="highlight">election</span> was the action that was taken to slap a stop writ on all the newspapers in the electorate concerned to stop them mentioning the Patrick Partners case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added to that is his latest key phrase- we have heard it many times since the <span class="highlight">election</span> and especially since the selection of the Cabinet- that there are no soft options for Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has happened despite an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that the new method of fixing pension rises- indexing them to the movement in the consumer price index- would enable the new Government to give pensioners their pension increases early and more promptly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The first thing we saw happened before the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign began, and seeing  Senator Sheil  sitting opposite me reminds me of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These are things that I fear most as consequences of the actions of 1 1 November and the resultant <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development: As he has already eliminated the technical assistance scheme for voluntary citizen’s conservation and environment organisations in 1975-76, will the Minister indicate whether in the next Budget this Government will adhere to its <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge, which was quoted as follows in the December 1975 Australian Conservation Foundation newsletter: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Chamber of Commerce to which I have referred said that the national Liberal Party’s federal tourism policy could prove to be merely an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick in the poorest taste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some ways the <span class="highlight">election</span> we had last year is related to that assertion for we had to fight for the right to political contest, which is more precious in the end even than whether one or the other side wins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> was unique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote the words of the man who was then Prime Minister, who with a little foresight could have remained Prime Minister up to the time of a properly called <span class="highlight">election</span> but who chose another course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> not only provided an endorsement for my Leader, the new Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, my colleagues who formed the caretaker ministry and who now form the Cabinet and Government of this country, and the policies of the coalition parties, but also asserted once again that the Senate has a role, rights and a place in our bicameral system, that the legitimacy of our Constitution overrides the wishes of any Prime Minister and that the Governor-General has and can use the reserve powers which are given to him in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was rejected in this place when the Senate stood firm and that rejection was endorsed by the people of Australia at the <span class="highlight">election</span> which followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the first double dissolution, and the Labor Party should remember that well because it was able to ride into power as a result of that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He managed to lead his Party to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, of course, where it received less than 41 per cent of the formal Senate vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He led them to an <span class="highlight">election</span> where our coalition parties achieved a swing of just under 9 per cent in the support of the Australian electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence of the December <span class="highlight">election</span>, I believe that the Senate now stands confirmed as probably the second most powerful upper house in the world, exceeded in its power only by the Senate of the United States, on which it is modelled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have a situation where the Senate chose to exercise its power and an <span class="highlight">election</span> followed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate, after all, precipitated the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the <span class="highlight">election</span> of which this Address-in-Reply is a direct result and I have pleasure in supporting the motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was all the talk during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of the Liberal Party wanting to curtail unemployment and to do something about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been exposed by what he said during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and by what he said later on once he became the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a Press conference lasting just 20 minutes, the Prime Minister had succeeded in casting doubt on every undertaking he gave in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy only 2 months ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People should be able to expect that a Prime Minister will abide by undertakings he gives in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, particularly in a carefully prepared, written policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said previously, particularly during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, I wholeheartedly support the attitudes and actions of those trade unions in this country which have placed black bans on ships, mail and what-have-you to Indonesia whilst war rages in Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I make a few general references may I, even in his absence, congratulate from the floor of the Senate chamber  Senator Laucke  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also like to congratulate my friend and colleague,  Senator Drake-Brockman,  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> a second time to be  Deputy President  and  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been continual talk in the Senate on the part of the Opposition concerning the problems surrounding the events of those days prior to 1 1 November and leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 13 December, referring presumably to the improper use of power by the Senate itself in establishing a circumstance in which this Parliament was deadlocked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that such an <span class="highlight">election</span> was forced is surely the very essence of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it was a significant reflection of the Australian character that in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of December 1975 the people were ultimately confronted with a choice that at long last had become clear to them and was relative to the position of the state in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But pending the ultimate recommendtion, it was an IAC recommendation which the former Government refused to honour and is an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise which we have already honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already we are seeing some of the results of the meaningless promises that spewed forth during the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We turn now to look at the Government’s role and at its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises in relation to the workers of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can assess for themselves whether in actual fact the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises that the present Government made are going to be kept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> we had an ‘on-again, off-again’ Medibank and still we are not terribly sure what is going to happen to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  indicated some of the measures that would be taken, and acted immediately upon them, to try to curtail the expenditure that was occurring in the publicsector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I took up the case with the former Minister for Labor and Immigration only a few weeks before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason, of course, that we have brought out a policy whereby we advocate that the trade union movement ought to be provided with a facility to have secret ballots for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gentlemen on my right will recall that the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span>, when I happened to be the member for Grey, was held under a redistribution that was introduced by my Party which excluded no less than 8000 votes from one of my blue ribbon rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course at the general <span class="highlight">election</span> we received a serious setback but we will fight back just as we have fought back previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having done that, when can the Government be expected reliably to carry out its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises- the promises contained in its manifesto? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir MAGNUS CORMACK (Victoria) (9.22)-  Mr Acting Deputy President,  I am sorry that the opportunity is not presented to me at this juncture directly in this place to congratulate the  President  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the high office which has been referred to by other honourable senators, namely the office of the Presidency of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 10 a.m.  Mr Whitlam  telephoned the Governor-General and informed him that he wished to call at Government House to advise an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 10 a.m.  Mr Whitlam  telephoned Government House and informed the Governor-General that he wished to attend upon him in Government House and advise him to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At 10.30 a.m.  Mr Whitlam  announced to Caucus that he intended to recommend to the Governor-General a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They made their judgment in the elections following the double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They not only overwhelmingly supported the candidates of the Liberal and National Country Parties in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> but also returned to the Senate under various labels those people who stood before them as upholders of the Constitution and the proprieties of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well recall a lady writing a letter to the Sydney newspapers in the early pan of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign asking when we would know who would be the government on <span class="highlight">election</span> night if the government that won the majority in the lower House was not recognised as the Government prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She made a valid point by saying that we really find little significance in the actual <span class="highlight">election</span> results if we do not accept the fact that it is in the House of Representatives- in the popular House- where governments are elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>including myself, hardened that  Mr Malcolm  Fraser was now in serious trouble and must soon agree to a Senate climbdown or face a pre-Christmas half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister on Monday night last have a conference with members of the board of the  Australian  newspaper to discuss publication of the article appearing in today’s  Australian  under the headline ‘Arabs in secret deal to pay ALP <span class="highlight">election</span> bills’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he will use his advocacy within Government to have legislation brought down this year requiring all political parties to publish the major source of their <span class="highlight">election</span> funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In it he seeks to justify his <span class="highlight">election</span> victory and to turn back the clock as far as Australia’s social welfare program is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to the credit of the  president  of the Australian Newspapers Council,  Mr Ranald  Macdonald, that he has severely criticised the newspapers of Australia and the newspaper proprietors who let  Mr Fraser  off the hook during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 14 March 1961, when, as honourable senators might recall there were some difficulties for the then conservative Government because it almost lost the <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Fraser  was criticised in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I begin by congratulating the  President,  in his absence, and paying to him the traditional courtesies- although they are traditional they arc nonetheless sincere- on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the high office of  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to congratulate you,  Mr Deputy President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the important office of  Deputy President  of the Senate and  Chairman  of Committees and offer you a similar assurance of loyalty and a constant endeavour to respect your office in my time in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let me begin my comments about that address given by the Governor-General by congratulating the  President,  through you,  Mr Deputy President,  on his <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So in extending congratulations to the  President  I remind him that his <span class="highlight">election</span> to office came about in quite extraordinary circumstances and I propose to refer to some of those. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a chamber which can apparently force elections at whim, can reject a Budget, can defeat a government by delaying a Budget and can defeat a legislative program which the Government was elected to carry out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said by Government senators that the Labor Party cannot take an <span class="highlight">election</span> defeat and that is what we are upset about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find that an extraordinary comment because we are very used to taking <span class="highlight">election</span> defeats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the fact that we were beaten in an <span class="highlight">election</span> which upsets members of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, twice in the term of a 3 year Labor Government the Opposition, for the first time in Australia’s political history, chose the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It chose the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1 974 which it lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It chose the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975 which it won. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is those matters which concern me and which lead me to take to task some honourable senators who have seen this undoubted bitterness amongst members of the Labor Party as some sort of aberration by people who were defeated in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, it is not the defeat in the <span class="highlight">election</span> which concerns us; it is the way in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was brought about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises made by the then Opposition, the Governor-General’s Speech is, with respect, full of sound and fury which signifies nothing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Victoria will be asked to consider these questions in a State <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held on 21 March of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, firstly, I offer my congratulations to you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the most honoured position in this Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly,  Sir, let  me add my congratulations to those of the honourable senators who have spoken before me on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the high office that you now hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although they might not be noticed nationally they have at least been noticed in their own State because of the circumstances surrounding their <span class="highlight">election</span> to this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were misled last year at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recently read something that the present Prime Minister said on 8 December before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the earlier period, that is from 1949 to 1952- the period when  Mr Fraser’s  patron  Sir Robert  Menzies was fulfilling his pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise to put value back into the pound- the index increased by 52.7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1966 the Australian Labor Party fought an <span class="highlight">election</span> on its opposition to that war in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-If Senator Mulvihill takes note of the overwhelming numbers of Liberal Party and National Country Party members who are now in the House of Representatives as a result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 13 December, he will realise that the action taken by this Senate and by the other place has been vindicated by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that approximately one week prior to the 13 December <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Broadcasting Control Board issued a direction to commercial radio and television stations that all decisions regarding the publication of <span class="highlight">election</span> news items should be made by news editors and that management was to take no part therein? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Others include the Presbyterian Church of Australia, the Aboriginal and Islander Catholic Council, the State Opposition, the Australian Conservation Council, Dean George,  Mr F.  G. Brennan Q.C., and  Mr Frank  Purcell, of Melbourne, the Aurukun people’s legal adviser (and a Liberal Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> candidate). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somebody said to me during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in December: ‘How will you know who has won the elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We looked at that future when we were out on the <span class="highlight">election</span> trail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But defeat in these circumstances can be more exasperating than usual, taking into account the things which led up to 11 November and 13 December and then looking at the electoral figures from the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Victoria, in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Australian Labor Party got 42 per cent of the vote and it holds 10 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some allegations were made during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and never denied, that confidential talks had taken place with employers who employed large numbers of women and that certain things had been said about terminating equal pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early in November, when Australians were still speculating about an early <span class="highlight">election</span>, an attorney for the American corporation, Westinghouse, was uncannily accurate in his forecast of the turn of events. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was said 5 weeks and 3 days before 13 December, the <span class="highlight">election</span> date, and 5 days before <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760226_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be found in the policy statement on this subject which was issued prior to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite certain that if the United States Navy wishes to come to Western Australia, whether for recreation leave or any other purpose, it will be welcomed by all the decent people of Western Australia, and they comprise the overwhelming majority of the people of Western Australia because at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the people of Western Australia returned not only six of the ten senators to this side of this House but also nine of the ten members to our side of the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say finally that I believe the Senate is a specialised House, both by virtue of its <span class="highlight">election</span> and by virtue of the work which its members do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the same <span class="highlight">election</span> he won a position as a delegate to the Federal Council representing the N.S.W. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to our policy today with respect to tertiary allowances, the present Government in the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign undertook that it would maintain the whole of the education programs that the former Government had announced in the Budget presented on 1 9 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in the policy that was announced prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975, and it has been reiterated by myself in this chamber and by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will not renege on its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to maintain the growth centre commitment not only in relation to New South Wales but also and more particularly in respect of those under consideration in Queensland and Victoria, namely, the cities of Townsville and Geelong respectively? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Mr President, I join my colleagues on this side of the chamber in congratulating you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the high office of  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like you to convey my congratulations to  Senator Drake-Brockman  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say ‘unresolved ‘ because I believe, as I think all honourable senators on this side of the chamber maintained throughout the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that the <span class="highlight">election</span> was not some type of referendum on the future of the Constitution or of the rights of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the Governor-General’s dismissal of the Whitlam Government on 1 1 November of last year and during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign many people, particularly aged people, came along to see me about the events that were taking place in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither the Senate nor any other upper house should deny money Bills and so force an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am about to repeat what has been said in the Senate many times: If it had not been for the death of the late  Senator Milliner  there would have been no <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is undeniable because 2 senators from the then Opposition said that they would refuse to reject the Supply Bills One of those senators is still in the Parliament; the other lost pre-selection by his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although in the last 3 double dissolutions the question of who will have the long term of 6 years and who will have the short term of 3 years has been settled rather amicably by both sides of the Senate, it could so happen that in an <span class="highlight">election</span> 30 senators from the Government side, 30 senators from the Opposition side and 4 independent senators or senators from a small political party were elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that matter should be looked at and that the practice followed in the past 3 double dissolutions could quite easily be written into the Constitution so that for all time the people of Australia would know, in the event of any elections, how senators would be placed and whether they were being elected for a long term or a short term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Prime Minister promised during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that he would support full wage indexation, no sooner was the case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission than he intervened in the case in an effort to halve the amount of the consumer price index increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An organisation or a branch of an organisation may, in writing, request the Industrial Registrar that an <span class="highlight">election</span> for an office in the organisation or in the branch (as the case may be) be conducted under this section with a view to ensuring that no irregularity occurs in or in connexion with the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of section 170 of the Act, the number of members of an organisation or branch by whom a request under that section for the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> for an office in the organisation or the branch, as the case may be, may be made is two hundred and fifty, or one-twentieth of the total number of members of the organisation or branch, as the case may be, whichever is the less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only 250 signatures are required to ensure that the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will conduct the ballot in the same way as elections are concerned for the Federal Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Election</span> of union members will be conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every ballot each year we would petition so that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers in the South Australian branch would be conducted by Commonwealth electoral officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First I should like to congratulate the  President  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the high office of the  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should also like to congratulate you,  Sir, on  your <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees, and the new senators who have made their maiden speeches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know, legislation is now being framed and the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon)  is carrying out the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President, I take this opportunity of congratulating you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opening Labor’s campaign for the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span>, Gough Whitlam put the progressive view of history as well as anyone has done before or since, in my opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not matter how an <span class="highlight">election</span> results; the Australian people have a consistent view that government is a creative force designed to serve their interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assurances which were given to the Australian people during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of November-December 1975 on the future of wage indexation have now been revealed for what they always were- shabby lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, there exists in a related area an obvious and growing need for legislation to be introduced both to regulate and to provide for the financing of <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot was said during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign about socialists and socialism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, before expressing my reasons for supporting the motion I congratulate  Senator Laucke  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  President  of the Senate and you,  Mr Deputy President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 2 elections gave me particular pleasure because  Senator Laucke  was one of the first new friends I found when I came into the Senate and of course you,  Sir, are  an old and valued friend and colleague from Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other activity in which the Opposition has engaged is the one which is at present tearing the Labor Party apart and that is the moves which have been made and the discussions which have been held about the sources of its <span class="highlight">election</span> funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This applies to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>indeed, to future elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I address myself to the motion let me through you,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  congratulate our  President  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to that high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the caretaker Prime Minister visited Darwin and promised statehood within 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at which a government changes is very much like the aftermath of an auction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some ways, of course, the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> was not a vote for the Liberal Party so much as a decided vote against the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The manner in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was held is something that will have a pivotal effect on the development of the Australian parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It will be a no-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party will be unable to obtain a majority in this Chamber at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> there was an extreme polarisation, which was evident to those in smaller parties such as my own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This happened particularly in the last fortnight and the last week of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is much left to be desired, of course, in the conduct of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, in many ways; some of this is still occupying the headlines of Australian newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that on the day of the <span class="highlight">election</span> that a person who, I believe, was an active supporter of the Labor Party, had arranged to copy a Liberal Movement how-to-vote card. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other circumstances- for instance in the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> which had a close result- it would have had a bearing on the result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it was, in this case it had no bearing on the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  entered the <span class="highlight">election</span> debate saying that it would be a fragile matter if we were to look for a consumptionled economic recovery and that the recovery would have to be based on increased productivity, not on consumption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  I join with all honourable senators who have spoken today in congratulating the  President  and the  Deputy President  on <span class="highlight">election</span> to their offices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Speech did not say a lot of things, in the same way as the caretaker Prime Minister, now the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  did not say a number of things in the course of his policy speech in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign prior to 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Senate that many more people than the 43 per cent who voted for the Australian Labor Party at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> are concerned and worried about what happened, how it happened and why it happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his summary of reasons,  Sir John  said: ‘If the Prime Minister refuses to resign or to advise an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and this is the case with  Mr Whitlam,  my constitutional authority and duty require me to do what I have now done- to withdraw his commission and to invite the Leader of the Opposition to form a caretaker Government . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had an <span class="highlight">election</span> in which  Mr Whitlam  ‘s majority of three in the House of Representatives was converted to a minority of fifty-five. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that there will be an early general <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses and the people can do what, in a democracy such as ours, is their responsibility and duty and theirs alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The double dissolutions of 1974 and 1975 demonstrated that a government which has been denied Supply by the Parliament cannot govern and should either advise a general <span class="highlight">election</span> or resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of most importance was the assertion of the supremacy of Parliament over the Executive Government, demonstrated by the exercise of the power of the Senate to withhold Supply and the dismissal of a Prime Minister who refused to advise an <span class="highlight">election</span> or resign when denied Supply by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the proper constitutional course of a government whose appropriation of Supply Bill is rejected or deferred is then either to advise a general <span class="highlight">election</span> or to resign, let us consider the propriety of the exercise by the GovernorGeneral of the powers that he exercised on 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the increasing public concern about the unknowns which surround the actions of both the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister in regard to the Iraqi <span class="highlight">election</span> funds issue, highlighted today by an advertisement in the  Australian Financial Review  inserted by the Citizens for Press Reform group, will the Government set up a royal commission to investigate the growing number of allegations in an atmosphere free of the spate of daily writs and mysterious police investigations, and give the public an opportunity to know whether (a) Iraqi funds have passed to the Australian Labor Party illegally in breach of banking regulations; (b) the Prime Minister is the source of the allegations which his Attorney-General has mentioned as the basis for Commonwealth Police action; (c) there have been communications between  Mr Rupert  Murdoch and the Prime Minister about this matter; and (d) legislation ought to be introduced to require political parties to publish the source of their campaign funds? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development will recall saying yesterday that continuing financial assistance for growth centres was now under review despite the Government’s assurance during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that, if elected, it would continue commitments entered into by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I lay on the table copies of petitions filed in the Court of Disputed Returns by Helen Therese Berrill, petitioner in the matter of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> held in South Australia on 13 December 1975 and in the matter of the Commonwealth Electoral Act; and by Bruce Noel Hill, petitioner in the matter of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> held in Tasmania on 13 December 1975 and in the matter of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recognition of the serious financial position facing the industry the coalition parties undertook to implement this recommendation in their <span class="highlight">election</span> policy program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, let me say that I think that the provisions which were in force at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> and when this Government came into office should have remained in force until such time as they were taken away following an inquiry by and recommendations from the Remuneration Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the situation that developed the former Prime Minister made it firmly clear that he was adamant that in response to the Senate’s objection to the Appropriation Bills he would neither advise an <span class="highlight">election</span> nor resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were forcibly and strongly told that the last practicable date upon which an <span class="highlight">election</span> could be held was 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite obviously, the Governor-General was presented with a practical predicament as to whether or not he, responsible for the executive government of the Crown, could carry on that Government if Parliament failed to provide the money and the government failed to vacate office or go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, a Prime Minister who cannot ensure Supply to the Crown, including funds for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general <span class="highlight">election</span> (of a kind which the constitutional situation may then allow) or resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The duty and responsibility of the Prime Minister to the Crown in each case is the same: if unable to secure Supply to the Crown, to resign or to advise an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governor-General was within his legal rights if he saw fit to dissolve the Ministry and seek an interim Ministry which would secure from the Parliament Supply and advise a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General did not feel he could let the country drift into the dangers of being led by a government without money to pay its servants or bills, and therefore has himself forced the appeal to the electorate, by putting  Mr Fraser  into office simply to hold a prompt general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He installed a government which does not have the confidence of the House of Representatives under circumstances which enable it to govern without parliamentary sanction and to run its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign with all the advantages of a government in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, Professor Howard (November 18) argues that the Governor-General of Australia’s action in dissolving Parliament for an immediate general <span class="highlight">election</span> (18 months after the last) has ‘taken the matter out of our hands’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Governor-General’s letter reads: ‘You have previously told me that you would never resign or advise an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives or a double dissolution and that the only way in which such an <span class="highlight">election</span> could be obtained would be by my dismissal of you and your ministerial colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On July 11, 1975, Professor Howard wrote to 77ie  Age  (Melbourne) to say that if a government sought to by-pass parliamentary control over supply in order to avoid a forced <span class="highlight">election</span>, it would strike ‘a blow at our system of government the seriousness of which it is difficult to over-estimate ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, a Prime Minister who cannot ensure supply to the Crown, including funds for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general <span class="highlight">election</span> (of a kind which the constitutional situation may then allow) or resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘In my view’, said Professor Colin Howard, ‘the loans scheme was simply an attempt to open up an extraparliamentary source of supply which would be available not, to be sure, to by-pass Parliament forever but to keep a Government afloat for long enough time to ride out the threat of another forced <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Bert Milliner had not passed away, those who now sit on the Government benches could not have forced an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They used the death of a senator as an occasion to collude with the Governor-General to bring about an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we refer to and study some of the decisions and speeches made by  Mr Menzies  in years gone by, we see that the Press statement that he issued prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> taking place was completely contradictory of ones he made many years before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constitutional authority of a Premier rests almost entirely upon his success at a general <span class="highlight">election</span> and upon his continued authority in the popularly elected House, and not upon irresponsible speculations as to whether he would have lost his majority if the Constitution had provided for annual and not triennial elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is exactly what will transpire in the future because the precedent has now been set by which a party having the numbers in this place, irrespective of whether it has the numbers in the other place, can force an <span class="highlight">election</span> every 6 months if it wants to, that is, every time a Supply Bill is introduced in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have a statement by  Mr David  Hamer who was elected at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It surprises me that after making this statement  Mr Hamer  even saw fit to offer himself for <span class="highlight">election</span> on 13 December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be outrageous if a government, whenever it took such a hard decision, could be forced into an <span class="highlight">election</span> at the whim of minor parties in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disastrous effect would not be that there would be many elections but rather that hard but necessary decisions would not be taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Hamer, after holding that opinion and making that statement, and in the light of the events which took place, saw fit to offer himself for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>’, yet when the Liberal Party went out on the hustings at <span class="highlight">election</span> time it said that the reason it had to take the Government to the people was the economic circumstances prevailing at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only thing, upon which he is basing that argument is what the Government’s great friend and the man who helped it to win the <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Murdoch,  has said in his newspapers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to take the opportunity of congratulating you, as one South Australian to another, on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the office of  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want to congratulate my colleague from the Northern Territory,  Senator Ted  Robertson, on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although my Party-the Liberal Party of Australiaexpressed reservations about the constitutionality of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators for the Territories it has accepted the ruling of the High Court of Australia on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the private sector which was uppermost in practically every paragraph of the supplementary speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  concerning the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that many public servants in the Australian Capital Territory, had they known what this Government intended to do to them, would not have voted for it at the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 13 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services, relates to the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> for 10 senators for New South Wales in which there was an initial count and a recount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think that any allegations were made at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> other than that officers of the Australian Electoral Office carried out their duties with their normal efficient and courteous - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I detect in the honourable senator’s question an attempt to get some nicker of activity into the Australian Labor Party’s campaign for the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the December 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Senator Guilfoyle,  the then shadow Minister for Education, expressed the view that there would be no undermining of educational standards in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually the Bill was deferred indefinitely pending the Government’s agreeing to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt  forgets that whatever the Senate does is subject, in the end, to the ultimate sanction of the people voting in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I said- I say it again this evening- that with inflation and unemployment as high as it is in the Western world today any government, whether it be a socialist government, a conservative government or a government of any other political persuasion, which went to the electors in this atmosphere would receive the same treatment as the Government of Australia received in December 1975 and as the Government of New Zealand received prior to that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The outcome of the forced <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975 has not eliminated the damage that has been done to the credibility of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been alleged frequently by Opposition senators, both before and after the December <span class="highlight">election</span>, that pay-as-you-earn tax collections this financial year under the Budget introduced by the Labor Government will be increased by 40 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has announced that it is reintroducing the superphosphate bounty, thereby partially honouring one of its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I observe in passing that it is one of the very few preelection promises by  Mr Fraser  which are to be honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Government that there will be no <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite a huge Budget deficit he can’t smash up Whitlam ‘s main welfare programs, such as Medibank, partly because he committed himself to maintain them during the <span class="highlight">election</span>, but mainly because expenditure is already allocated for a year ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How free are the people of this country when we remember how we were forced out of office in November last year after the Australian people at a free <span class="highlight">election</span> had elected a government for a term of 3 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By all the manipulations of which one could possibly think the then Government was forced to another <span class="highlight">election</span> in November last year- the second in 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> by people who used devious and unscrupulous means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the supplementary speech that was made by the Prime Minister during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, to whom does he refer in every second paragraph? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our policy statement for the <span class="highlight">election</span> we made it clear that we had done so and that we saw a great cause for careful study of that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, bearing in mind these delays in the implementation of the Act by the previous Government throughout 1975, what immediate action is to be taken to make operative the Australian Heritage Commission, which was supported by all parties in the Parliament and which was part of this Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy commitment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Minister inform the Senate whether the decision in the Garland-Branson case established a precedent that will make <span class="highlight">election</span> corruption and bribery a respectable profession in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Administrative Services whether, in relation to the 1975 double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government intends to take any action to enforce compliance with the provisions of sections 151, 152 and 153 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act relating to the submission of returns by candidates of expenses involved, returns of expenses by political organisations involved and the submission of returns by newspaper proprietors? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an indication of the importance which this Government places on Australia’s relations with Japan that this Bill was amongst the first Bills introduced by us in Parliament after our <span class="highlight">election</span> to Government last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I confirm those congratulations which I expressed immediately after his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the chair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, I extend my congratulations to you,  Mr Deputy President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference was made to the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held at the end of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">election</span> represents an event of some historical significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I believe is of more importance and of greater significance is the result of that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever interpretation the community or the writers may put upon the result of that <span class="highlight">election</span>, it contained clear warnings to governments and political parties for the future because it became perfectly clear that the style of government of the Whitlam Administration was certainly not acceptable to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such candidates were not able to share in the wonder of the victory which we had at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention this because it will materially influence the result of the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will give the Government parties a singular advantage at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and for some considerable time to come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I for one responded enthusiastically when I noted in the Liberal Party policy statement made prior to the general <span class="highlight">election</span> the line that indicated that the Liberal Party would establish a national information office to monitor, store and disseminate information and other data. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not quite sure why he was so excited about the change in the voting figures in South Australia that he noted on the occasion of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Davidson’s excitement could be extremely short lived, particularly if he is looking to repeating the performance in the next half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before and during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign clear and unequivocal statements were made by the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and his shadow Cabinet, which formed the caretaker Administration, that social programs would go on as usual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and his supporters said during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that they would support wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I am honoured to be able to congratulate you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the highest office in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also would like to congratulate  Senator Drake-Brockman  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as the  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a moment for me was my <span class="highlight">election</span> and admittance to this chamber which, according to the  Clerk  of the Senate,  Mr Odgers,  is one of the most powerful upper Houses in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gets belted every time there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> with promises of what the Country Party will do for it but as soon as the <span class="highlight">election</span> is over and the Country Party members come back to the Parliament, back to the rut the farmers go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am good friends with many farmers although not many of them vote for me at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Opposition has dealt so much with past issues I think it is fair to say that the issues with which the Opposition has chosen to occupy this debate for so long were canvassed at great length during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as honourable senators know, that was a major point in the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have spoken already in the debate on the original motion that was moved by  Senator Knight,  I do not intend to touch upon the more controversial aspects of the remarks made by the Leader of the Government,  Senator Withers,  before the suspension of the sitting for lunch, except to say that not one  speaker  from the Opposition has queried the verdict of the people at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said, and  Senator Button  distinctly said that we of the Labor movement accepted the verdict of the people but that we did query and we did express concern about the manner and the circumstances in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was able to be brought about by the dismissal of a previously properly elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also wish to congratulate  Senator Drake-Brockman  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> as  Chairman  of Committees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He referred to the fact that it is estimated that at least 50 per cent of trade union members did not vote for Labor in the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> but, in fact, voted for the return of a Liberal-National Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people in advance of their being an <span class="highlight">election</span>, had no doubt at all about the need for an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If its pleas for assistance cannot be heard at the top level and it becomes submerged in the general welter of governmental operations within the States, one can easily see a situation developing in which the Federal Government wipes its hands completely of local government and local government is left floundering in the position it was in prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it is high time that my question was answered and that the questions of so many people in local government were answered as to where this better deal is to come from and how it is to be funded from the Federal sphere, having regard to the unacceptable attitude that was adopted by the Federal Government prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government in 1 972 when local government, for the first time in its history, earned an overdue recognition of its function. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year the Government emphasised the importance it attached to the need to eliminate widespread abuse of the unemployment benefit system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and Government spokesmen during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign claimed that they would do what they could to obtain belter relations with the trade union movement and that they would consult with the ACTU at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being a party parliamentarian and a politician, I realise that a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> is due to be held in Monaro- an electorate of the New South Wales Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the dairy industry will play an important part in that by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government of New South Wales has decided to establish a dairy industry inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after that Government was dismissed, the present Minister for Administrative Services,  Senator Withers,  early in December, after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, released the report of the IAC into the dairy industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has decided to do so because a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in the electorate of Monaro, which is just outside Canberra, is to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New South Wales Government has acted in that way only because a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held in the State seat of Monaro. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the supplementary <span class="highlight">election</span> speech made by  Mr <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that approximately one week prior to the 13 December <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Broadcasting Control Board issued a direction to commercial radio and television stations that all decisions regarding the publication of <span class="highlight">election</span> news items should be made by news editors and that management was to take no part therein? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would seem that the direction to which the Honourable  Senator has  referred was a circular letter from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and sent to all commercial broadcasting and television stations on 18 December 197S, one week after the General <span class="highlight">Election</span> of 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The letter did not refer to <span class="highlight">election</span> news items but rather to the respective responsibilities of news editors and management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, as I recall the position, their <span class="highlight">election</span> a year or 1 8 months ago provided one of the first pieces of evidence that the people of Australia were rejecting the lunatic policies of the Whitlam Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and I will keep saying, there is no doubt that once governments get involved in the media and there is a Department of the Media, both the Minister responsible for that Department and the departmental people get an itch to interfere with the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to a statement which was made in May 1974 by the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  at the declaration of the poll for his division in South Australia following the general <span class="highlight">election</span> held after the double dissolution of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was rudely shockedperhaps brought back to reality- in the first month after my <span class="highlight">election</span> to this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 September 1 started to campaign for the 1970 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I campaigned from then until the <span class="highlight">election</span> in November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I had set out in that <span class="highlight">election</span> to try to get into this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After having found myself unsuccessful in that <span class="highlight">election</span> I went back to the State department in which I had been employed before I left to do fulltime university studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next time I was in receipt of unemployment benefit was again after a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974 I had to resign my position to contest the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was obliged to resign from that position because I was seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was not successful in that <span class="highlight">election</span> either. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, because of the expenses I had incurred as a candidate and because I had been off work for a long period before the <span class="highlight">election</span> I was forced, because of family responsibilities, to take unemployment benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that that is exactly what the Labor Party wanted and what it eventually might have obtained had it been returned to power in the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 December 1975, during the currency of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign,  Mr Bob  Ellicott, who was then the Liberal-National Country Party spokesman on Aboriginal affairs and who is now the Australian Attorney-General, sent a telegram which was widely distributed throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Land rights legislation to have top priority immediately after <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the failure of the Government to honour its 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that the existing Commissioner for Housing loans scheme would continue will cause widespread hardship among citizens of the Australian Capital Territory because: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the record I will quote telegrams, copies of which were distributed, as far as I know, to all Aboriginal settlements prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> held on 13 December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the Country Party sent a telegram to all the settlements saying that there would be no cutbacks in the Aboriginal Affairs budget or Aboriginal projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Prime Minister has made that statement in the last 24 hours, let us hope that, for God ‘s sake, he is not telling us another lie as he did throughout the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and ever since he has been Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that this is happening is a repudiation of every promise made by the Liberal and National Country Parties prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not known, but at the date on which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was suspended, the eligibility of candidates had not been confirmed by the Chief Electoral Officer, and any serious campaigning would have been premature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-62-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn also to a statement in that article that the Electoral Officer for New South Wales began sending out letters last Wednesday to candidates and political parties which were involved in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, asking them to complete and submit the returns to the Electoral Officer? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There was no mention during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Government intended to destroy the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Fraser  committed the Government to the introduction of company tax indexation over a 3-year period for depreciation rates on plant and stocks held, and to the introduction of tax indexation for individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do blame him for using a spurious excuse for not honouring one of his <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and for having the audacity to assert that there will be no increases in taxation under a government led by Malcolm Fraser unless the Government explicitly legislates for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because I think the people of Australia should never be allowed to forget the way in which they were misled and hoodwinked in 1972 leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government, I have extracted the policy speech which  Mr Whitlam  gave with such eclat in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Chief Australian Electoral Officer has informed me that he has supplied the honourable senator with copies of <span class="highlight">Election</span> Form 62 (‘Results of the Scrutiny of First Preference Votes in Respect of Polling Places’) for each State and Territory, in respect of the 1975 House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the failure of the Government to honour its 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that the ‘existing Commissioner for Housing loans scheme would continue’ will cause widespread hardship among citizens of the Australian Capital Territory because: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Has the Premier of New South Wales,  Sir Eric  Willis, advised the Minister or the Prime Minister of his intention to announce this afternoon the withdrawal of the writs for the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in the State seat of Monaro and the holding of a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales on Saturday, 1 May 1976? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the latter part of his question, might I say this: Since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 13 December last, when the Party to which the honourable senator belongs was annihilated in both chambers of this Parliament, there have been 2 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall it, 2 elections have been held since that date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I further recall, in the Brisbane City Council elections last Saturday, in which for the first time the Liberal Party fielded candidates, there was a 12 per cent swing away from the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know why the honourable senator is so upset that  Sir Eric  Willis- if he has done as the honourable senator alleges- desires to bring on an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would have thought that if the honourable senator was dinkum he would have welcomed an <span class="highlight">election</span> because on his premise a gentleman whose name I cannot recall but who leads his State Party may well become the next Premier of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what he would be if an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the members of the Labor Party are so full of fight towards us- they have not shown much of it because they have been so busy fighting amongst themselves in recent months- I would have thought that the honourable senator would welcome an <span class="highlight">election</span> being called by  Sir Eric  Willis, and if he wants an <span class="highlight">election</span> I will see whether we can accommodate him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that a challenge to the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in Tasmania has been filed in the High Court? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that if this challenge is upheld Tasmanian senators may not be properly seated in the Senate and that a new <span class="highlight">election</span> would be necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Liberal Party candidates in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigned on a platform of selfgovernment for the Australian Capital Territory and that the Liberal spokesman on Australian Capital Territory matters at that time,  Mr Vic  Garland, endorsed the local Liberal platform of self-government, can  Mr Staley  ‘s remarks of yesterday be interpreted as a complete aboutface by the Government on its much vaunted policy of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had noted the comments of  Mr Staley  relating to self-government for the Australian Capital Territory, but I am unaware of the comments that were made by candidates at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave- In this statement I announce to the Parliament the Government’s proposals for the implementation of its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to introduce a restructured home savings grant scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will this announcement fully implement an <span class="highlight">election</span> commitment; it will also provide clear evidence of our determination to ensure that all Australians shall have a meaningful opportunity, if they choose to avail themselves of it, to own their own homes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we find that this report, which contains no basis for means test application, presented to the Senate today by  Senator Greenwood,  while it may be associated with an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise nevertheless does not in any way, shape or form make up for the leeway that exists in regard to accommodation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the Council will adopt as soon as possible the policy that it outlined during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The charges that were laid against Norman Bray and supported by a statement signed by Frank Shanahan but not sworn by him indicated that in particular  Mr Bray  had participated with Shanahan and others in a meeting with one Brian Harradine, the secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council, concerning the issue of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in which  Mr Ray  Gietzelt was involved at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was that I allegedly held a meeting on 30 March 1971 to campaign against  Mr Ray  Gietzelt and his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Miscellaneous Workers Union in the R.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 13 December, I made a decision which I communicated to my colleagues, that whilst for the first time in, I think, some 10 or 1 1 years a government- I put it that way quite deliberately- in this place would have a majority of senators in its own right I would hope that I would not have to use those numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The fact is that certain moneys were allocated under the area improvement program before the Government took office after the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 1 3 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760401_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware that there has been any increase in racial discrimination since an arbitrary date, namely, the date of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The re-introduction of the bounty- one of the few <span class="highlight">election</span> promises carried out by the Fraser Administration- is and was a cynical attempt on behalf of the Liberal and National Country Parties to appear genuinely interested in the suffering of the small and needy farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it particularly surprising that that sort of comment should come from a member of a Party which went into an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign 10 years ago with an emotive slogan about the downward thrust of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to point out to honourable senators opposite that this bounty was an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So his contribution to that <span class="highlight">election</span> was not a great deal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very interesting to note that  Mr Pollard  who was a Victorian member of the House of Representatives at the time, when speaking about the repeal of the bounty-  Mr Pollard  in that debate was not agreeing with  Mr McEwen-  went on to say that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Liberal and Country Parties did not mention that they were going to remove the bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been said tonight, in reference to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> only, of course, that the superphosphate bounty was a big issue in country areas and was the reason that the Labor Government went out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760406_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the need for the continuance of Commissioner for Housing loans on the same basis as before the December 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put a twofold question to the Minister: How does she reconcile Liberal Party <span class="highlight">election</span> statements that used such words as ‘unequivocal’ and ‘specific’ in stating that this service that the Minister administers would come under the umbrella of the portfolio of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that members of the particular organisation to which the honourable senator refers have taken very harsh action against members of my political party, organising against them during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns and at other times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So overall my own Government is pledged to proceed as from the next Budget with tax indexation as was part of its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This compromise solution provided the basis of the <span class="highlight">election</span> commitment subsequently given by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the Administrative and Clerical Officers’ Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That subsidy was allowed to expire in 1974 by the Labor Government and is being re-introduced at this time because of an <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I made an investigation of who used superphosphate in the large electorate of Fisher, a rural electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One will see that when it comes close to <span class="highlight">election</span> time, when it comes to making policy statements, when it comes to outlining the platform of the Liberal and National Country parties we will find that the superphosphate bounty will be promised again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760407_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister: Did the Prime Minister during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign make an unqualified commitment to maintain tax deductibility on home mortgage interest rates as introduced by the Labor Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative assessment is that  Sir Eric  as Premier of New South Wales has decided with a total abdication of responsibility to abolish the tax because he is facing an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 1 May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is significant, however, notwithstanding the Premier’s publicly proclaimed support for the proposals, that he has decided to hold a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in August, 7 months before it is due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the Liberal Party’s current plan is to hold a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in August, before the Federal Budget comes down, because the Premier of Western Australia knows very well that he would have no chance of winning an <span class="highlight">election</span> if it were held when it is due- in March 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within my memory a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> has not been held previously in the State of Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Western Australians are sick and tired of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two elections have been forced upon them prematurely already by the actions of the Liberal Party and National Country Party in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last thing that Western Australians want in 1976 is another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, the people of Western Australia ought to make known in no uncertain terms that they are not impressed by the Premier’s cynicism, his opportunism or by the cheap trick that he contemplates- the cheap trick of getting an <span class="highlight">election</span> out of the way before the people begin to learn the truth about the Fraser Federal Budget and the Liberal Party’s new federalism policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales we have the Premier,  Sir Eric  Willis, with his <span class="highlight">election</span>-eve promise to abolish the State petrol tax, again without making any suggestion as to how the consequential shortfall in Government revenue will be funded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Carrick said he did not expect it would be issued before the December 13 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the New South Wales State Government-  would act to reduce the price of New South Wales bread by up to 3c a loaf immediately after the May 1 <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Premier,  Sir Eric  Willis, said yesterday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My concern is that the Premier of any State can forecast that he is able to reduce to that extent the price of a loaf of bread, but not until after an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760408_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, we oppose it because we believe that before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government promised that it would not do this sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Reference has been made to the policies which the Liberal-National Country Parties put forward prior to the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the absence of any such alternative I think that in the interests of the people who raised pension issues during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the people in elderly citizens clubs who asked questions at public meetings, the people generally of the State I represent and the people of Australia who were interested in this matter, we should not support the withdrawal of this benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Bills, particularly the Social Services Amendment Bill, repudiate the promises made to pensioners and to pensioner organisations in the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of November-December last that the value of social welfare benefits in this country would not be reduced if a Liberal-National Country Party government was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that nowhere in pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> policy speeches was there a word about funeral benefits or in fact about subsidised pharmaceutical benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> the coalition parties promised to tie benefits such as the dependants allowances to the CPI. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the record of the previous coalition Government between 1949 and 1972 with pensions and allowances we believe that the Government should be asked by this House to index all associated benefits so that in the future pensioners can have some guarantee as they were promised before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to try to ensure that in the future the Senate makes sure that the Government follows up the promises it made before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the recent general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Clark  reprimanded me very strongly because I suggested that pension values would drop under a Liberal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Clark  referred to members of the present Government and to their promises before the <span class="highlight">election</span> in his letter to the  Launceston Examiner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the pensioners I can only extend my deepest apologies for any part I played in deceiving them during the  <span class="highlight">election</span>  campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills actually put into effect what we promised during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened to the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises that were made by the Government’s then spokesman on social security matters,  Mr Chipp,  regarding the timing of pension increases? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where are the automatic and instant increases that were promised by  Mr Chipp  as the spokesman for Social Security during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I touch on the abolition of the funeral benefit I would like to mention one final thing about pensions, and it concerns what the spokesman of the present Government said before the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the sorts of things that were said before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and these are the sorts of things that should be put before this Parliament following the return to power of the people who made these promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a number of occasions, in policy speeches preceding elections, attention has been directed to the inadequacy of this benefit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in recent years, no mention has been made of the funeral benefit in the course of federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support this Bill because I believe it implements a very important <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Government to adjust pensions in accordance with movements of the consumer price index twice yearly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the present Government was campaigning in the recent general <span class="highlight">election</span> it made great play on relieving voluntary organisations of the burden of always being the bunny in providing the ready cash in emergency situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be recognised that the first increase in pensions after the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1972 occurred after an interval of 9Vi months from the previous increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What action is the Government taking to fulfil its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of re-opening negotiations with the Guild and bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the ‘Scott Inquiry’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Chipp, in the November-December <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fairly obvious from the reference to the suburbs which  Senator Douglas  McClelland mentioned that there must be an <span class="highlight">election</span> about to be held in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I hope he will pardon me if I regard his question as being directed primarily to that <span class="highlight">election</span> on next Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They threw out every Labor member of the House of Representatives in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sure there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales on Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It cannot have escaped notice that a State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign is being held in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I almost apologise for interrupting the conduct of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> which has broken out, particularly in the last speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to  Senator Walters,  who a few minutes ago expressed some shock at the extent to which the Senate would be so used by members of the Australian Labor Party to fight that <span class="highlight">election</span>, that there is a curious feature about the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A feature of the last Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span> was that  Senator Button  rose so valiantly into the lists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know the result of that <span class="highlight">election</span> and we know the assistance which members of the Labor Party in this chamber gave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, at this time  Mr Wran  may be saying, ‘Save me from my friends’, because it is his friends in this place who are imposing and who are insisting that they want to be in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make no apology for the fact that the Labor movement in the Senate is raising this issue today, 3 days before a State <span class="highlight">election</span> is held in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite what has been said by honourable senators opposite, I, as a member of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, am one of those who have participated in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that only a couple of weeks before the New South Wales Government faced a State <span class="highlight">election</span> it decided to order some new commuter buses for the travelling public of Sydney indicates surely that the needs of the community in this regard have been wantonly disregarded for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Suddenly a State <span class="highlight">election</span> is called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, in the course of the current <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in New South Wales, the State Premier has determined that if he is returned to office payroll tax will be eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the undisguised delight of his political opponents and the scarcely disguised anguish of his supporters the New South Wales Premier,  Sir Eric  Willis, has performed a policy somersault in the closing days of the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an undisguised and confessed attempt by the Federal Labor Party to get in on the platform that is being occupied by the campaigners in the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of the Labor speakers have said that they have taken pan in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason why people like  Senator Douglas  McClelland,  Senator James  McClelland,  Senator Arthur  Gietzelt,  Senator Kerry  Sibraa and I have crossed the State in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign; that has been our objective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Whitlam then said to  Mr Takriti:  ‘I want to thank you very much for this generous help, but I am afraid that due to <span class="highlight">election</span> pressures I must now leave because I have an appointment with the television station and 1 am only sorry that I cannot talk to you more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is taking it out on the people whose votes the Government sought before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, before it started pulling the rug from under those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the third <span class="highlight">election</span> the present Government was not game to fight on Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It fought the <span class="highlight">election</span> on other dangerous issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It only narrowly won that <span class="highlight">election</span> in terms of the percentage of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the circumstances of today, of course, the debate has been used as an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigning exercise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather remarkable that only 5 Labor senators should see fit to be here engaged in an exercise which Labor itself projected today and which I presume is related to the coming <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>South Australia, sought desperately to bring about an <span class="highlight">election</span> before the Labor Budget was presented a month later in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though he succeeded in holding that <span class="highlight">election</span> a month before the Federal Budget which filled him with fear was presented he gained only a one seat majority in those circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course,  Mr Holding  in Victoria, whose Party was so severely defeated in the recent State <span class="highlight">election</span>, would have no brief for Federal intervention in his State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the surface it sounds fine, but in actual fact when one relates these increased payments to the circumstances that were the prelude to the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975 one finds that they were part of a system- in fact, part of an ideology- that produced for this country a national deficit beyond the imagination of any Australians up to that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two of the incidents that we have witnessed tonight constitute a fair measure of the desperation of the Liberal and National Country parties on the eve of the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all the boasting and the bombast which we saw early this afternoon and which we have seen during the previous few weeks, it is quite apparent that the Government parties desperately fear that they will be defeated in the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span> on Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government parties do all these things in the forlorn hope that somehow or other they will be able to inject some elixir to revitalise the wilting Willis campaign for the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us disregard the pseudo philosophical claptrap which seems to permeate practically all the policy statements which came from the Liberal Party both before and after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it is obvious from the antics and contortions of members of the Liberal and National Country Parties in the Senate today that they have little confidence in the ability of the Willis Government to survive next Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is equally apparent from a cutting which I have from the Sydney  Daily Telegraph  of 9 April that the Willis Government has no confidence in the Fraser Government’s ability to fulfil its preelection pledge to control inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Federal Party clearly has no confidence whatsoever in the ability of the Willis Government to survive next Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760428_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Government accede to the request of the New South Wales  Deputy  Premier,  Mr Punch,  to delay presentation of that report until after his recent personal public relations inspection of Botany Bay and until after the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Sydney Morning Herald,  which is noted for its conservatism and for its editorials at the time of a federal, State of local government <span class="highlight">election</span> enjoining the people to vote in a certain way, in its editorial today states:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Eric  Willis fervently supports the Fraser Government’s commitment, overwhelmingly endorsed in the December <span class="highlight">election</span>, to reverse the centralist trend of the Commonwealth Governments (of both parties) since the war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very difficult to understand how  Senator Wright,  as the representative of one of the smaller States which can be likened to Oliver Twist always asking for more, can take the position that he took in the debate yesterday, a debate which he alleges had some relationship to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, at <span class="highlight">election</span> time one could imagine that  Mr Willis  would try to suggest that he is going to do very well out of this new system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might well be that  Mr Fraser  will want to honour one of his few <span class="highlight">election</span> promises about reducing Federal taxation, but he can only do so at the expense of cutting back on his total program, his total responsibilities and his relationships with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is right and responsible that we should be raising these matters in the Parliament prior to people voting in the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, the dairying industry, federalism and a great number of other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, if the latest statistics now available to the Australian Electoral Officer were used, there would have to be redistributions in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales before the 1978 <span class="highlight">election</span> to take account of the changed number of members to which each of those States would be entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the matters to which I have already alluded, I suggest the report could look at the excessive costs involved in conducting an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It could look at the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act concerning elections, whether there should be a 3-day blackout on radio and television immediately preceding the poll whilst there is no similar embargo on newspapers, journals or magazines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At last December’s <span class="highlight">election</span>, in the seat of McPherson, the number of voters had increased to 102 175 and in Maranoa, in the same State, the number had increased to only 46 433. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, on that electoral distribution for the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> it appears that 2 Maranoans go for every one McPherson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last <span class="highlight">election</span> it had 9 1 8 1 8. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By last December’s <span class="highlight">election</span> the number of voters in Wannon had risen to only 54 583. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has to be done before the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and that, at the most, is only  2h  years away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, we have compulsory voting in Australia and, in the best traditions of democracy, it is assumed that every Australian over the age of 1 8 has listened to the political debate that has taken place over an <span class="highlight">election</span> period, has assessed the political issues and has made a selection, on an alternative basis, of his choice of candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there are 40, SO or 60 candidates at Senate elections, as there have been in New South Wales, the task becomes a farce if not an impossibility for many people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We dictate to him that he shall vote and then, in exercising that vote, we expect him to have acquired a good knowledge of all the candidates contesting the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that is not much different from what we expect a voter to do in Senate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia as a nation cannot afford the luxury any longer of having the most complex and complicated voting system in the world, thus having to wait at least 2 and possibly 3 months after an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held to know the composition of its Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the situation at the present time when a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760429_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree with  Senator Wriedt  that the federalism policy was a major or significant issue in the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the honourable senator that he and his Party had 2 goes prior to that- one in the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> of 13 December 1975 when the honourable senator sought to raise the issue and was soundly and resoundingly beaten, and the other in the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> when there was a resounding victory for  Mr Hamer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also ask the honourable senator to remember  Mrs Beaton’s  advice for jugged hare- first catch the harebecause the honourable senator is seeking to see in the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> hares that are not there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Administrative Services: Is he aware that in the New South Wales elections last Saturday for the first time in that State’s history polling booths were open only from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. to handle a general <span class="highlight">election</span> and a referendum, without apparent consternation being shown by anyone and obviously with very sensible voting trends taking place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again surprising as it may seem, I am aware that an <span class="highlight">election</span> took place in New South Wales last Saturday, and I am also aware that for the first time 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. voting was tried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the previous senator-  was chosen shall, sitting and voting together, choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, at the <span class="highlight">election</span> following the double dissolution of 1914, the non-Labor Opposition polled nearly half of the Senate vote but won only five of the 36 places in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1919 there was only one Labor senator, and from 1946 to 1949 Labor held thirtythree of the Senate places to non-Labor’s three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My opinion is that, in view of the fact that proportional representation is now the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate, a member of the same Party, nominated by the Executive of the Party, should be appointed when future vacancies arise through death or other causes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of illustration of the difficulties confronting the Committee, it would have been necessary, in any constitutional alteration, to deal with possible cases of a vacating senator who joined another party after <span class="highlight">election</span>, became a member of another party because that party succeeded the party in existence at the date of <span class="highlight">election</span> or who, for that matter, was not a member of any party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party chose as its nominee  Mr Peter  Westerway who had been an unsuccessful candidate for Labor in the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end therefore, t should appreciate your advising me as soon as possible the names of three persons whom your Party would be prepared to nominate for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of one of them by the Parliament to fill the present casual Senate vacancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Parliament does meet, it must then proceed within fourteen days to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a person to hold the late Senator’s place in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was argued that with one name only before the Parliament it was not possible for the Parliament, in the terms of the Constitution, ‘to choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Without the support of Senators Bunton and Hall, the Opposition would have been obliged, if it wished to use the Appropriation Bills to force an <span class="highlight">election</span>, to reject those Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is probably significant that this senator’s State organisation was successful in its attempts to prevent  Senator Bessell  from returning to this chamber after the December 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>; or, at least, it put sufficient obstacles in his path to prevent his return. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has caused a great deal of concern, not to mention economic hardship, to the pensioners and it has caused them to doubt the good faith of this Government with respect to many other <span class="highlight">election</span> promises that affect pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it to be the policy of this Government to continue to let the pensioners lag behind the CPI increases or will the Government accept the responsibility that it undertook when it asked pensioners to vote for it in the December campaign and fulfil its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of making these increases automatic and immediate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An undertaking was given during the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that this would be one of the first pieces of legislation introduced by the new Government, and this Bill represents the honouring of that undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, I comment briefly on the question of contract or <span class="highlight">election</span> to retire at age 60 under this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, the elections under the present Superannuation Act are elections to contribute on a specific basis, not elections to retire at specific ages. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Electors in the Australian Capital Territory also voted for it, and this is instanced by the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Senator Knight  as one of the senators representing the Australian Capital Territory and  Mr Haslem  as one of the members representing the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the expenditure by each political party and candidate who represented political parties on newspaper and magazine advertising on a basis of (a) metropolitan dailies, (b) provincial papers, (c) suburban papers, (d) weekend newspapers, and (e) magazines, during the 1974 and 1975 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-55-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is clear is that in February this year, and after the <span class="highlight">election</span> when the incoming Government could take charge of events, action began to flow from the present Government- the Fraser Government- and, in the case of the foreign affairs matters, under the aegis of  Mr Peacock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a unique situation in 1973 in my State of Victoria when the then Minister for Education, suspecting what might be in the Karmel report but without actually knowing, went around Victoria promising that every school would have a library if the Liberal Government was returned to power in the State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we know, that special report of the Schools Commission was endorsed by  Senator Guilfoyle  when she was spokesperson on education during the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is good, too, I think, to remind ourselves that the primary function of this Bill is to discharge an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then 1 5 years after receiving the first information, 10 years after the death of  Senator Paltridge  and on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>- not a federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, but on a day on which it was known the first allegations would be published, on the very day before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, cowardly cutting out any proper opportunity of reply on the part of Paltridge and others before the <span class="highlight">election</span>- we had one of the most cowardly and despicable episodes of defamation in the political history of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet, it could not even win the New South Wales <span class="highlight">Election</span> conducted last weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> have now been shown to be inaccurate and that the swing was in fact a relatively small 3.7 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over some 3 decades now I have had some little experience in comparing <span class="highlight">election</span> with <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In individual elections different numbers of candidates are fielded by particular political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recent New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> it is true that Labor had, I think, some 6 more candidates fielded in electorates than previously so that this time it registered a larger vote, which last time was disguised in independent votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vote for Labor in the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> was artificially lower because its vote was hidden in independent votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1973 State <span class="highlight">election</span> a very large number of independents were standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw honourable senators’ attention to the fact that a correction would have to be made also for an aberration in previous elections with regard to the State seat of Gordon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do I correctly interpret his answer to mean that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in the New South Wales Liberal Government was saved by independents and small splinter groups? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So quite clearly the independent vote heavily favoured the Labor Party at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, and no doubt was distributed and went to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Australia all evidence shows that the Liberal vote- as demonstrated on 13 December last year, as demonstrated in Victoria, and as will be demonstrated in future State electionsis polarising at a higher and higher figure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister agree that if the seat of Gosford is lost by the Liberals, in all probability it will mean the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government in New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is so, will the Minister agree that, contrary to the utterances of the Prime Minister, Federal Government policy will have had a very direct bearing on the outcome of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that the States were told in December that upon the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government it would undertake to implement the calendar year program for schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, in the 1976 report, which was endorsed by  Senator Guilfoyle  when she was speaking on behalf of the then Opposition in the December <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year, we find provided in paragraph 2.3: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they believe that espousal of that policy by the Australian and New South Wales Governments had nothing to do with the result of last week’s <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the Senate- and the Government could well find this out for itself if it wished; it need not take my word for it- that one of the reasons why the rural vote in New South Wales swung so markedly to Labor in last Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span> was that we of the Labor Party were able to get across to rural voters and to local government organisations in rural areas in particular that under the untied and unconditional grants made available to local government by the Australian Labor Government consequent upon the recommendations it received from the Grants Commission, the ratio of payment was of the order of $3 for the country to $ 1 for urban areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Government that if it were to ask some of its candidates in rural areas what happened and what were some of the reasons for the marked swing to Labor in last Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span>, they would say that was one of the principal reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, we also tried to elevate the status of local government by a referendum that was held in conjunction with the May 1974 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, namely, to seek a power to enable the Australian Government to make grants direct to local government throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been subjected to campaigning in the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise a matter which I believe may be subject to some confusion because of the ministerial responsibilities which were allocated temporarily during the term of the interim government before last year’s general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before that <span class="highlight">election</span>  Senator Guilfoyle,  I understand, as Minister for Education, made a ruling in relation to some private tertiary education organisations and that ruling appears to have caused a great deal of difficulty in the running of those organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760506_senate_30_s68/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, in the case of both West New Guinea and East Timor, the Indonesian actions were escalated during a time of elections or their aftermath in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of West New Guinea, President Sukarno’s call to all Indonesians to be ready for general mobilisation to liberate West Irian came 10 days after the 1961 general <span class="highlight">election</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Little was he to know that at the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the following Saturday the New South Wales electors would reject the very simple way in which he had attempted to suggest that federalism was understood by the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been subjected to campaigning in the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this gave birth to the federalism policy document of the Liberal and National Country Parties during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One finds this statement to be an extraordinary example of the scene 6 months after the <span class="highlight">election</span> in which there is still this calculated vagueness in a proposal as important as this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The road legislation enacted by the Whitlam Labor Government was the first such legislation it introduced, and obviously it will be the last until the next <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1978 or perhaps, with the way things are going in the coalition at the moment, at a much earlier date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties lost that <span class="highlight">election</span> basically because of 3 policies: Their neglect of farming areas, their neglect of the transport system and their institution of the 2-tax system- the new federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Did the Broadcasting Control Board during the month before the 1975 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> issue a directive to all radio and television stations, both commercial and government, which said that all decisions regarding political material were to be made by news editors and not by management; if so, what is the text of the directive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The directive referred to was a circular letter from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and was sent to all commercial broadcasting and television stations on 18 December 1975-one week after the Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> of 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760519_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he received a circular, part of which is reproduced in today’s Press, from the General Manager of Mcwilliams Wines Pty Ltd,  Mr D.  R.

    <p>Some weeks ago I asked a question relating to a petition to the Court of Disputed Returns on the matter of the Tasmanian Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why would such a damaging statement, if untrue, be made by an endorsed Liberal candidate for the next Tasmanian State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other side, consistent with our <span class="highlight">election</span> undertakings to support the home loan interest tax deduction scheme, this scheme will be kept in being but in a way that we consider looks better to the realities of the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We gave careful thought to the producers’ position in the months preceding the <span class="highlight">election</span> and said that, on being returned to office, we would review the taxation arrangements that apply to wine and brandy stocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether there was outside influence or not, we know that  Mr Rupert  Murdoch played a prominent part in both the dismissal of the Government and the subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Regardless of whether that money was sufficient to decide the outcome of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975, there were other forces at work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With the suspicions which justify complaint concerning the activities of the Murdoch crew in regard to this <span class="highlight">election</span>, more investigation is warranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, not to be overlooked that when we embarked on our policy of restraint following the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December, expenditures in this financial year were already largely pre-determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was made clear before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the Federal government had been given too much power and that more of that power should revert to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Senator Cotton)  suggests that it is necessary to regain control of the national Budget, a principle which we in this place discussed only a few weeks ago, on the eve of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I forecast that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held tomorrow they would not survive because they pulled the political wool over the electors’ eyes prior to 13 December by fear tactics and everything that goes with them and now they are trying to do so by financial fear tactics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I think it appropriate before I do that tomorrow and as the first sessional period of the 30th Parliament draws towards its close to refer to some of the undertakings made by the present Government during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last NovemberDecember, and to the implementation of those undertakings, particularly the most important of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we undertook that if returned to government the National Capital Development Commission would be under the responsibility of the Minister for the Capital Territory so it would be, as it was always intended to be, a planning body for the national capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot of remarks were made about him by members of the Liberal Party because he was overseas at the time he gained preselection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One Liberal Party member told me the other day that he was prepared to bet that the honourable senator will not be here after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and that there would be 2 Labor senators representing the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Does the Government intend introducing secret ballots for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of all officials of industrial organisations in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-14">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) The Government, in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy, has undertaken to look for ways, through extension of rural reconstruction, by which approved applicants might lease farms for a period of ten years with an option to purchase at the end of that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister for Education by reminding him that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the LiberalNational Country Parties, as part of their promises to the people of the Northern Territory, said that there would be no expenditure cuts in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeing the Premier welcomed the new federalism policy just a short while ago, does the Minister think that the Premier is now trying to backtrack and join the New South Wales bandwagon on the double taxation scare campaign, as an <span class="highlight">election</span> is due in our State shortly? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface, I remind the Minister that in the <span class="highlight">election</span> held last weekend in Tasmania the Australian Labor Party candidate, being opposed by a previous Liberal Party Minister and a previous Liberal Party senator, obtained 57 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the members of the Labor Party raised the question of Medibank during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- or were they too busy worrying about the past and not about the present? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turning to what happened in last Saturday’s Tasmanian <span class="highlight">election</span>, the honourable senator did not say that although the seat was won by the Labor Party it was a seat which previously had been held by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adverting to the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">election</span>, I understand that  Mr Mather,  a Liberal member of the House of Assembly in Hobart, is reported to have said on 26 May that: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that all politicians can get all sorts of things out of all sorts of figures but the simple fact is that if  Mr Neilson  feels so confident that support is running so strongly in his favour the best thing he can do is to take the Assembly to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which we in the Liberal Party would welcome. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 27 November included the following passages: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that one of the reasons for the long agitation in this place by honourable senators opposite particularly which resulted in 2 elections in the 3 years that we were in office was the claim that we were extravagant in our welfare provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the general <span class="highlight">election</span> they said that the future of Medibank would be ensured; there would be an improvement in employment and our education and general welfare policies would be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he was checked by one of the interviewers about these pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises he said literally that politicians could make all sorts of fantastic promises but the resources of Australia were not there to keep the promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact  Mr Fraser  was saying, as we have said, that the promises that he made before the general <span class="highlight">election</span> could not be taken seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our policies prior to the December <span class="highlight">election</span> we made it perfectly clear that we supported tax indexation and would introduce it progressively over a period of 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I point out to  Senator Wright,  who is always interrupting, that that very man will be a Liberal candidate in the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Street  and I took part in a television appearance on  Monday Conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Fraser  promised, firstly, that he would maintain wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber face the fact realistically that a great number of trade unionists must have supported  Mr Fraser  or else he would not have been able to get the thumping majority that he got in the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this was the first lesson in disillusionment that the workers of Australia who had voted for  Mr Fraser-  who had put their faith in him- had about what an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise meant to  Mr Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some reference has been made today to  Mr Fraser  ‘s appearance on  Monday Conference  this week in which he said, in effect, that an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise made in the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of course is not to be taken seriously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-There was no qualification upon his promise, and I suggest that the honourable senator reads  Mr Fraser  ‘s <span class="highlight">election</span> speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest, in fact, to every member of the Liberal and National Country Parties that he go back and reread the <span class="highlight">election</span> speech of  Mr Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been demonstrated by, among other things, the result of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>, which I know came as a real kick in the teeth to the architect of the new federalism,  Senator Carrick,  who was prepared to bet me on the day before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that nothing remotely like that could be possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any senator on the Government side who doubts that statement can read any one of  Mr Fraser’s  speeches made in the course of that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above everybody else in this Senate I believe that you,  Mr President,  recognise this because of the efforts you have made in this area since your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Whitlam Government- the Government supported by  Senator McLaren-  at the time of the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> in July 1975 promised to extend the original period of 5 years to a period of 7 years to enable the industry to pay these taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as this present Government is concerned, the industry was assured during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year that the new basis of stock valuation for winemakers, combined with industry company tax rates, was threatening to bankrupt many important Australian wine producing companies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government is that we now find that people actually are doing what in the past they were only saying they would like to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have seen the Government do during the time it has been in office, despite the undertakings it gave in December of last year, prior to that <span class="highlight">election</span> which should never have taken place, is to reverse those principles completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a system which will breed confusion and fear in the minds of all Australian people, and it will replace a system which the members of the Parties that constitute the present Government undertook during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in December of last year they would not interfere with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suicide rate has not changed in any way by the <span class="highlight">election</span> to office nearly 50 years ago of the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party which has remained in office ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple and sad fact is that the present Government is totally bereft of moral authority because of the sleazy circumstances- to use  Senator Hall’s  succinct phrase- under which it seized power and the succession of repudiations of its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> policy in which it has indulged since it was elected to office in December last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, I believe that at least one senior member of the Liberal Party has been acknowledging in recent weeks that the investment allowance constitutes a classic example of the foolishness of entering into firm commitments long before an <span class="highlight">election</span> to implement certain policies, no matter how inapplicable those policies may be to the reality which exists at the time the Government implements them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of the general <span class="highlight">election</span> many people, myself included, pointed out that a country would not recover very quickly after 3 years of that sort of treatment; it would take some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dominant aim of this Government expressed at <span class="highlight">election</span> time and expressed again in the statement is to bring inflation under control as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Governments policy, stated during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, to seek ways to encourage private enterprisebased industries and business to locate in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Neilson  does not like what he agreed to at a previous Premiers Conference, why does he not hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> and take the matter to the Tasmanian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by leave-  Mr President,  honourable senators will recall that the Government undertook during last year’s <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to reintroduce schemes for the training of Army, Navy and Air cadets which our predecessors decided to disband. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, I think it ought to be understood that this proposal does not honour the promise that the Government made before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was that it would recommence the cadets training scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1  sought it by way of asking a question in this Parliament when we resumed after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The explanatory memorandum informs us that this additional appropriation is for the purpose of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Northern Territory to a seat in the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when the nominations were called for a person was elected unopposed and it did not take the long time it would have taken to fill this vacancy if an <span class="highlight">election</span> had been held during the wet season. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I conclude by saying that if there is any effort to translate that into legislation everybody who purports to represent the apple industry in Tasmania must resist it to the uttermost of the authority which <span class="highlight">election</span> to this Parliament gives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will not oppose the proposal relating to the trading stocks of wine makers, but it is necessary to highlight the fact that the proposal is a breach of a government undertaking given during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is important to note that the principle which was enacted by us in 1973 now is being continued by this Government, despite the assurances that were given during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government said unequivocally that it would continue to support the tax deductibility scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I trust that in the comments that I have made to the Senate we can see holes in the legislation, particularly in relation to the Government’s undertakings during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These charges sound remarkably like the ‘missile gap’ claims which aroused anxieties in I960 only to dissolve suddenly a few weeks after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation involves the breaking of <span class="highlight">election</span> promises with the removal, for many, of home mortgage interest deductions and the inadequate alterations to wine makers’ tax liability; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in South Australia in July last year- a very opportune time-  Mr Whitlam  made statements to the effect that the Labor Government would alleviate the pressure on wine makers who were affected by section 31a and the decision to remove it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal varies significantly from the proposal laid down by  Mr Whitlam  at a most politically opportune time last year prior to the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed,  Mr Mcwilliam  himself or his company circulated just before the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> a letter which was tantamount to a threat of dismissal to all of his employees if the Labor Party were returned at the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has now given wine makers a longer period in which to pay but it has not fulfilled its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, a promise made by the Honourable P. Lynch on 19.6.1975. to ‘abolish Labor’s new stock valuation system’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we have learned since then that remarks and promises made by members of the present Government in the period prior to 13 December 1975, and in particular those remarks and promises- the absolute guarantees- made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  himself, on his own admission on the  Monday Conference  television program last week were valid only for the period of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The modern or most recent variant of that is the Prime Minister’s admission on  Monday Conference  last week, once we reached 13 December 1975, all his pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises ceased to have any validity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it could be said that the Government’s investment allowance had absolutely nothing to do with the brewery’s decision since the decision predated the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Government and its announcement that it was going to legislate for this allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some criticism was levelled at  Mr Whitlam  during the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in South Australia last year when he said that we would increase the period for payment from 5 years to 7 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We gave careful thought to the producers’ position in the months preceding the <span class="highlight">election</span> and said that, on being returned to office, we would review the taxation arrangements that apply to wine and brandy stocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Adelaide  Advertiser  of 2 December 1975 when we were engaged in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign there was an article headed ‘Liberal Pledge on Wine Tax Relief. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my colleague  Senator Walsh  pointed out in his remarks tonight, many of the promises which were made by the present Government during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign have been dishonoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that in the Riverland district of South Australia with which I am very conversant the people at their next opportunity to go to the polls might force the <span class="highlight">election</span> to go to a distribution of preferences as happened several years ago when the wine tax was imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government has made no effort to restore that section despite promises which were made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The present Government has now given wine makers a longer period in which to pay but it has not fulfilled its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have been advised that one of the large private winemakers in Australia went so far as to suggest to its workers during the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I am referring to McWilliam ‘s Wines Pty Ltd and I believe it is in its interest that I bring this matter into the openthat they would be sacked if a Liberal and National Country Parry Government was not returned to office because the coalition parties were making promises relating to section 3 1A. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was this stated as Australian Labor Party policy before the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not such a proposal a device to avoid coming to terms with the Federal Government’s new federalism policy, against which  Mr Wran  conducted such a virulent campaign prior to the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were then stuck with the previous Government’s policy from then until the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s intentions to provide for secret postal ballots was one of the issues most commonly discussed during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government had proposed that all elections for officers should be conducted by the Australian Electoral Office, with the cost of the <span class="highlight">election</span> being paid for by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators will know, it is already the practice to provide for officially conducted elections at Government expense- provisions which, I might add, the unions indicated, when they saw the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on 5 May, had their support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the Minister’s discussions with the unions they expressed very strong opposition to the proposal that the Electoral Office should conduct all elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Commonwealth  chairman  of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, less than 2 per cent of the total membership exercised its prerogative to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AMWU had had similar experiences with elections for other office holders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it therefore proposes is that all organisations, whether of employers or workers, will be required to have elections conducted by secret postal ballot, and that these arrangements should have the opportunity of a 2 year trial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may in special circumstances be other methods of <span class="highlight">election</span> in which all members would have an adequate opportunity to vote, the ballot would be conducted without intimidation, and it would result in a greater participation by members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where an organisation’s rules do not provide for postal voting, its rules may not be appropriate for the conduct of elections by postal ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Clauses 3, 12 and 13 of the Bill give effect to the proposals on <span class="highlight">election</span> ballots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will, of course, still be open to organisations to use the present facility to have <span class="highlight">election</span> ballots conducted on their behalf by the Industrial Registrar or Commonwealth Electoral Officer at Government expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As things stand, as a result of amendments introduced in 1973, organisations which provide for collegiate voting are required to move to direct <span class="highlight">election</span> for full time officers by mid November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In our <span class="highlight">election</span> platform on Environment and Conservation Policy we stated ‘we will examine with each State Government the need for and cost of monitoring air, water and noise pollution standards and where necessary criteria for measurement of standards . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren suggested that the Government had broken <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to wine makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Treasurer said in a second reading speech, the Government promised during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to review the taxation arrangements that applied to wine and brandy stocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is consistent with comments made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  after the <span class="highlight">election</span> which implied that statements and promises made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign were not necessarily binding on the Government after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Medibank program has other disadvantages, and we alluded to them before the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the recent federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we made it clear that our first commitment was to fighting inflation and to righting the economic ills which afflicted this country as a result of 3 years of socialist irresponsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We made it clear before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that in order to win the fight against inflation we would need to cut government expenditure in all sectors except education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the pamphlet which summarises our <span class="highlight">election</span> pledges again we said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government would not have been game to go to the people in that <span class="highlight">election</span> and say that it was going to do away with Medibank, that it was going to threaten Medibank in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, it said: ‘We will maintain Medibank and the standard of health care will be maintained’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion, I urge the Government to stick to its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, this is a blatant breaking of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> manifesto and these are temporary arrangements to last until September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the chamber oppose those Bills because they constitute a violation of the major <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medibank as a national health insurance system is working remarkably well; so well that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the coalition parties included it in their <span class="highlight">election</span> platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I only hope that the Tasmanian people realise that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is imminent and that this is the reason the Minister for Health in that State is coming out with these exaggerated comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to mention briefly now some aspects of what happened in the course of the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and what the present Government said it would do with relation to Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 28 November, before the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign concluded, on  This Day Tonight,  Richard Carleton asked  Mr Fraser: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making it plain, he probably ensured that he did not enter the Ministry after the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing about the legislation which is not completely in line with what the Government said before the <span class="highlight">election</span> and has said since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and again during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and other Government spokesmen on welfare gave assurance after assurance, when challenged, that Medibank would remain, that it would not be disturbed and that most certainly it would not be dismantled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used to think Lloyd George was the prince in this field because he contested and won an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Great Britain with the slogan ‘Hang the Kaiser’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chipp  let the cat out of the bag in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when he disclosed the Government’s intentions regarding Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although the level of child endowment was increased, it was not until 1950, when  Mr Menzies  was again Prime Minister and in order to honour an <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge, that any endowment was introduced in respect of the first child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that whilst we were in opposition, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and since we have been in government, overseas investors would have been quite aware of our policies on foreign investment in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister for Social Security: Seeing the community at large is still this morning being told that the Government has broken an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise and is disbanding Medibank, could she inform the chamber of the Prime Minister’s promise during the time of the general <span class="highlight">election</span> that Medibank would be looked at and that minor changes would take place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could see it on May Day in the big cities in the processions, if there isn’t enough hammer and sickles and red flags flying around the streets, as we’ve seen it during <span class="highlight">election</span> time to put a fire under people and to make them realise that they’ve got to choose people who are prepared to be alert to these things and be  positive,  be active, be interested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only place at which one finds reference in the legislation to ‘an office in or an office within’ is in clauses 12 and 13, which provide that the office holder must come up for <span class="highlight">election</span> after 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So proposed section 4(4) refers only to those who must come up for <span class="highlight">election</span> and not to those who must be elected by postal ballot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is compelling that person to retire from his position every 4 years and to stand for re-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that wage indexation would be supported by the Government, which was made by  Mr Fraser  in December last year, a quite open attack has been made on the principles of full wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people do not want to petition for a ballot one must assume in a democratic society thai they do not want to do so for the very valid reason that they are content with the union officials they have or with the candidates Ibr an <span class="highlight">election</span>; that they are content with the present system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the fact that trade union officials constantly have the knowledge that they have to face an <span class="highlight">election</span> in a prescribed period of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill contains a provision that secret ballot elections may be conducted within the structure ofthe union, and I believe that that is a sensible and important provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>exempt the organisation, in respect of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, from the application of this section if he is satisfied that the conduct of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in accordance with those rules- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will entail the <span class="highlight">election</span> of one more judge to the panel and will create the proper status of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  during events leading up to last year’s <span class="highlight">election</span>, continually criticised the Labor Government for its economic policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to the promises made by  Mr Fraser  during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, at the first hearing before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on wage indexation he reneged on his <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that this Government will try to put the blame on the trade union movement if it fails-there are ominous signs that this will be the case- to fulfil its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to contain inflation and to reduce unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will try to put the blame on the trade union movement for strikes and <span class="highlight">election</span> ballots that do not please the Government; ballots in which the wrong officials are elected or officials are elected who place too much importance on conditions and the welfare of the members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being passed through the Parliament for a purpose, namely, so that at a later stage the Government may have it proclaimed if it finds that the measures it has introduced- slashing expenditure here and there and at the same time giving huge handouts to primary industry by way ofthe superphosphate bounty only because it was an <span class="highlight">election</span> promiseare not effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government does not worry about the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise it made to support full wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have stated previously,  Mr Fraser  very quickly reneged on that promise which he made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of section 170 ofthe Act, the number of members of an organisation or branch by whom a request under that section for the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> for an office in the organisation or the branch, as the case may be, may be made is two hundred and fifty, or one-twentieth of the total number of members of the organisation or the branch, as the case may be, whichever is the less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 4 per cent of the total membership- requesting that the elections for officers of the union not be conducted under the terms of the rules of the union but be conducted under the terms of this Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that, whether that <span class="highlight">election</span> be for the officers of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union or any other union officials who are giving a service to the members, the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> would remain exactly the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not concerned with whether only 2 per cent or 95 per cent ofthe membership of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union voted at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that, irrespective of how the ballot was conducted, whether it be under union rules or under the control of the Registrar, the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers the tremendous costs involved in union elections, it seems to me to be quite incomprehensible that the unions should be disagreeing with our proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am led to believe that if the AMWU were to run an <span class="highlight">election</span> and pay for the <span class="highlight">election</span> itself it would cost approximately $ 1 50,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the collegiate system I make the general observation that it seems to me only reasonable that in order properly to obtain democracy in unions there should be only one tier between the individual member of a union and the final <span class="highlight">election</span> to Federal leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate also that a continuous series of public opinion polls taken authoritatively has shown that a vast majority of the public and trade unionists believe that the secret ballot system properly conducted for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of office bearers should be introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The simple fact of the matter is that what the Government is seeking to do is to provide what must be regarded as essential in a democratic community, namely, an opportunity for full participation by members of trade unions in what is a vital function- the <span class="highlight">election</span> of their office bearers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following reply to the honourable senator’s question: ( 1 ), (2) and (3) The Committee of Inquiry into the role of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee will consider,  inter alia,  the method of selection or <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the NACC; the Committee of Inquiry is due to make its recommendations to me before 31 August and the Government will decide whether further elections will be held after it considers these recommendations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-69-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although we are not debating the Budget this afternoon- we reserve that for next week- it is necessary that we consider the immediate problems which confront this country at the present time as a result of policies introduced over the past 8 months by the present Government, despite undertakings which were given last year before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all remember that during the course of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> one of the cries of the Liberal and National Country Parties- to their eternal shame- was to get the dole bludgers back to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1975 from 1 1 November to 13 December, the caretaker Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, said that the economy would be maintained by spending on social security and that social security services, in particular, would be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And they will face a reduction in their unemployment benefit in real terms as a result of the decision not to adjust the benefit in line with consumer price  movements  as was promised at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact last year in the course of the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign he sounded much more like a used car salesman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, I quote from the Melbourne  Age  of 29 November 1975, some 12 or 13 days before the general <span class="highlight">election</span>, which reported him as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just observe in passing that that was typical of the behaviour of that newspaper throughout that entire <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, throughout the 4 months that preceded it and indeed throughout the 8 months that have succeeded it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told by the present Government when it was in Opposition that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal government would ensure that the problem of unemployment would begin to be solved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think my colleague,  Senator Button,  quoted the Prime Minister as having said that within 6 months the problem would be overcome; all that was needed was the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This policy incidentally was one endorsed by  Mr Malcolm  Fraser in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill, which in this respect is of a purely mechanical character, will bring about this result but it also validates acts or things done by the Electricity Authority and any <span class="highlight">election</span> by the Legislative Assembly of a member of the Authority since the time the Advisory Council was superseded by the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760818_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that the Government in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- I remind the honourable senator of the result of that campaign and of the attitude which was taken to our policies- made it perfectly clear that we regarded trade practices legislation as in need of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the present Government the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Howard)  set up a committee to conduct a general review of the trade practices legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The activities of the review committee have been perfectly well known since the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was one of our <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to set up that committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1975 the coalition parties’ policy contained repeated references to the importance of such a concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760824_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Government concerning the Albury-Wodonga twin city development scheme indicate its intention to repudiate the original support it gave to the enabling legislation, to repudiate the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking of continued support and to repudiate the solemn, legally binding agreement between the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian governments? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I chaired an all-day meeting of the Economic and Trade Committee of my federal parliamentary Party after the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span>, at which we discussed the strategy that was to be worked out in respect of the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This was made perfectly clear by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The then Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech in November 1975- remember, he became Prime Minister on 1 1 November in the caretaker government- assured the people of Australia that a consumer led recovery would be short lived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 27 November, during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign,  Mr Fraser  had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The investment led recovery which, according to the policy speech of the present Prime Minister and the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> policies of the Liberal Party, was the only way to secure an economic recovery, has now been dropped as an economic measure from the Fraser-Lynch rhetoric. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the ballot box has proved to be a futility, as it did late in I97S, and when a political party seizes power by violating conventions and by lies and misrepresentations, and when it arrogantly and blatantly breaks its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises, which is what the Liberal and Country parties did in respect of Medibank, the majority of the Australian people, particularly the working class people in Australia, have every right to use the methods of passive resistance - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this yet another example of efficient government, which was the main promise made by the present Government during its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thinking back to those wonderful little housekeeping homilies that we were treated to during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, I wonder whether the planners and the Government realise that a stitch in time does save nine and that there is a false economy in their policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Government side made it perfectly clear during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last December that we would be doing things in a responsible way, not looking to be a popular Government but looking to be a responsible Government because we would be acting in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we also know that  Mr Dunstan  is warming up for a State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hence at this stage there is very little on which the Premier can hang his hat for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The promise at the <span class="highlight">election</span> was that we would introduce tax indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the December 1975, <span class="highlight">election</span> we believed that the Prime Minister was referring to the original form of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the statement is nothing more than a rather cynical rationalisation of the failure of the Government’s economic policies, an attempt to excuse broken <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and, ultimately, an exercise in self-delusion about an industrial relations policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More particularly, how can a trade union official say that to his members in the context of the Government’s promises made at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> or in the context of a government which, in Opposition in  1973,  opposed a referendum to give power over prices and incomes to the Australian Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser,  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> speech in November  1 975  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later, in the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what he was saying right throughout the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These steps have been taken by the Government which is now pleased to announce a wages policy 9 months after its <span class="highlight">election</span> in the context of a severe recession which is continuing; in the context of company profits which are well above the inflationary rate in respect of 83 per cent of companies which have published figures to date; in an economy which is described by  Senator Durack  in the statement as precarious- and one might well ask whose responsibility is that in the context of the promises which have been made; and in the context of a declining level of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-7">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we heard how they would cure all these ills and how they would rapidly restore the nation’s economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twice in 3 years they forced us to an <span class="highlight">election</span> because of the brutality of numbers that they were able to exercise in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Government said that it would not reduce expenditure in socially important areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Chipp  who was then the shadow Minister for Social Securitythat was the last time he was shadowed- stated that Medibank should be disbanded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I was there it was explained to me what was happening in Portugal today and as a member of the Australian Labor Party I am proud to say that the assistance, both moral and financial, given by the Australian Labor Party helped in some small way towards the victories which the Portuguese Socialist Party achieved in the <span class="highlight">election</span> recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without the effective performance of the Portuguese socialist party under  Dr Soares,  both electorally and in government since the <span class="highlight">election</span>, Portugal would long ago have fallen to the forces of dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is breaking the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that was made by the Liberal and Country Parties in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Government, during the 1970 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, said: ‘We will build 2 dams following the Stott line’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision was announced prior to that <span class="highlight">election</span> for political purposes and to achieve political advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is fair dinkum about unemployment it should remember the <span class="highlight">election</span> policies of  Mr Street. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760908_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget marks a very significant departure not only from the policies which were pursued by the Labor Government during its less than 3 years of office but also, in emphasis, the policies that were followed, however inadequately, for 23 years by the Liberal-Country Party Government which preceded the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Labor in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The health services for Aborigines have been allocated Sim less than in 1975-76 despite the fact that the present Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott),  when he was the Opposition spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs, promised before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> that there would be no cut whatsoever in the moneys to be made available for Aboriginal services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably most importantly of all in that field, again despite promises that were made before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> by the people who now constitute the Government, Medibank which was accepted by the people, which was voted for on 2 occasions in Federal elections and which was introduced as a result of a joint sitting of both Houses of this Parliament, has been so mutilated as to be unrecognisable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  said in his <span class="highlight">election</span> speech in the Northern Territory last December, perhaps Statehood will be achieved in 5 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760909_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He served in that Parliament until October 1949 when he resigned from that House to contest the Federal seat of Blaxland which he won at the 1949 genera] <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- Perhaps it is useful to remind ourselves once again that the people of Australia had an <span class="highlight">election</span> last year and voted the then Government out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been said by people such as myself on many occasionsbefore the <span class="highlight">election</span>, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing was said during the subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to the effect that a Liberal-National Country Party government would impose a levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is one of the areas in which the Government misled the people during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know about that famous telegram that was sent during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign by  Mr Ellicott,  who was then the Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to all the Aboriginal communities in Australia pointing out to them that if a Liberal-National Country Party government was elected there would be no reduction, not even by one cent, of expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt those recommendations are causing  Senator Bonner  very great concern because he now realises that this Government- through its then shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Mr Ellicott-  during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign promised the Aborigines that it would not cut by one cent the appropriation by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those were the statements and the promises given by this Government during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was in the gallery and I said to him: ‘How is your campaign going for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘I wish the <span class="highlight">election</span> was on Saturday because I would have a majority of 5000 votes’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Webster says that it is bad luck that we cannot have an <span class="highlight">election</span> very soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not have any solutions yet they endeavoured to convince- and did convince -the people during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year that they had all the solutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, the people have woken up to the fact that this Government does not have the solutions and when they get the opportunity in another 2 years time- it could be less than 2 years because a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is coming up- they will be able to point out to this Government that they were misled during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal Government is going to pass the buck so that when  Mr Fraser  has to face the electors for the half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> he will be able to say: ‘Look, you cannot blame me; that is the States’ problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It reminds me that many years ago when  Mr Playford,  who was then the Premier of South Australia used to promise every <span class="highlight">election</span> time that right down the coast and around to Ceduna he would construct deep-sea ports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did this until one wag interjected at an <span class="highlight">election</span> meeting and said to him: ‘Are you going to construct a port at Karoonda?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall leave it until then because we will be on the air and people will be interested to hear  Senator Young’s  remarks to the effect that unemployment is much higher at the present time than it was when the previous general <span class="highlight">election</span> was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ever since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government a series of direct and indirect statements and accusations has been made by Ministers in this chamber as well as in the other place fixing on Aboriginal communities the blame for the wastage in Government expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760914_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to our <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1 972 the Commission was literally starved for funds for development purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it incongruous, to say the least, to hear this from a member of the Liberal Party, particularly a senator from Queensland, the State Parliament of which, we will remember, was recalled the week before a federal <span class="highlight">election</span> so that the Premier could make entirely unsubstantiated allegations about the honesty of Cabinet Ministers in the former Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it incongruous, to say the least, to hear this from people whose present Treasurer, just before the previous general <span class="highlight">election</span>, accused the former Labor Party Treasurer of stealing files and had this allegation published by courtesy of the Murdoch Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also noticeable during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns that took place in the days of  Sir Frank  Packer that the conservative parties always got the advance bookings for <span class="highlight">election</span> advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I say to them- I believe that what I am saying to them is quite correct- is that the present Government has set out to destroy Medibank, despite the assurances given by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that he would not interfere with Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It promised Statehood to the Northern Territory during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign but it has been exceedingly quiet about that matter since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows that people in the primary producing industry are upset and disgusted that this Government has failed to honour the many promises it made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This has all happened without an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Australian  has the headline ‘Drink can hits PM in violent <span class="highlight">election</span> rally’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Daily Telegraph  has the headline ‘<span class="highlight">Election</span> mob punches and pelts PM ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think we also know that  Mr Dunstan  is warming up for a State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760915_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that after the <span class="highlight">election</span> honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives were asked to supply biographical notes and photographs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be aware that prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government parties undertook to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal and to use the machinery of the trade practices legislation to promote fair prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequent to the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government received representations from trade unions and other sections of the community to retain the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of these representations the Government undertook to review its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking and to have consultation with interested parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760916_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I had occasion to phone him after he had put out a Press release. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Senator Withers  put out a Press statement- I shall quote from it before I finish my speech- aimed at winning the support of many people in the far northern areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760921_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign I got some information from Leigh Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we find that on 20 September he put out another Press statement only reiterating what  Senator Withers  had put out in a Press statement in December of last year during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and what the two Liberal members of Parliament referred to by  Mr Dunstan  had said in June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Dunstan  visited that area well recognising that it displayed a tremendous interest in returning a Liberal and National Country Party government at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, well recognising that the Liberal and Country Party vote in Leigh Creek was better than the Labor Party vote and recognising that the reputation of members of the Labor Party in that area was at an all-time low ebb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in the electorate of Grey a swing of less than .6 per cent on the last <span class="highlight">election</span> figures is all that is required for the Liberal-National Country Party to regain that seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall that in October 1972- well before the <span class="highlight">election</span> period and in fact before the <span class="highlight">election</span> date was known- the  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that this is a matter of one-upmanship but one does react very strongly when colleagues of one’s Party in South Australia and oneself happen to be discredited by the Premier of South Australia for purely political purposes and obviously in fear of his life that he is going to lose the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, which is a very strong possibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it is not my intention to answer  Senator Jessop,  I feel I must say something in view of his confident forecast that the Liberal Party will win the House of Representatives seat of Grey at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that  Senator Jessop,  as the person who lost the seat of Grey for the Liberal Party, ought to put his money where his mouth is if he is so confident, resign from the Senate, and contest the seat at the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In February, on the eve of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the 1965 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The slate government plans to spring the biggest shock of its 23 years reign in its state <span class="highlight">election</span> policy to be announced soon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills are a further step by the present Government in the dismantling of Medibank which was set up by the previous Government and which the present Government in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy announcements before 13 December last promised to maintain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The name of Medibank may well remain but there will be a return- this is one stage in that return- to the concept of health insurance which we had before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the former Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government, in its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last November, said that it accepted that Medibank was a fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such is the Government’s haste to placate the private health funds which assisted it so much with finance and other help during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is nice to know that some people on the other side never change and that some of them occasionally are willing to criticise their leaders for not supporting those who supported them so financially and with such great manpower during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should not be witnessing it at the moment because the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made a promise during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that Medibank would be continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, legislation would not have been prepared for this scheme and it would not have been passed by the Parliament had it not been for the double dissolution that followed our original <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1 972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The brief statement made in  Mr Fraser’s  policy speech was amplified during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all,  Mr Fraser  during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, said that everyone would have the opportunity to express his views in relation to it after public statements had been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that his constituents during the campaign for the next <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives will ask him why he said that he could not care what happens to Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They had one and they will demand another one at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but it has been forced by its <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge to maintain a semblance of the scheme, while committing the country to an ever more complex and grossly expensive system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will demand one at the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>, when there is a different government, they will be provided with such a system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Currently the PSRO issue is quite a hot little number in the United States presidential <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the Government has honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and retained the fundamental principle that was set out by the Labor Party and compaigned upon in several elections; that is the universality principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth while, I think, to review the history of the present Government’s attitude to Medibank both before and after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government gave a commitment that Medibank would be maintained and improved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After making some preliminary comments about the fact that the Government had promised to maintain Medibank during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the editorial in the  Australian Financial Review  stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that this Government is maintaining, in contradiction of the assurance given by the Prime Minister even after the general <span class="highlight">election</span>, is the use of the term ‘Medibank’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I was making,  Mr President,  was simply that the failure of the Government to honour the undertakings given to the electors before the general <span class="highlight">election</span> with respect to Medibank is consistent with its entire actions since it has come to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The overall effect of the Government’s amendments to the Medibank legislation is an undermining of Medibank to the point where it is fair and accurate to say that this Government has broken its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to maintain Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> is the only way to give them the opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such an <span class="highlight">election</span>, on such a cause, the people would be delivering judgment not only on this Budget not only on the Gorton Government, but on themselves as a nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that an Opposition could properly bring on an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the sort of grounds of responsibility that I’ve mentioned, is not by meddling around and throwing out bits of Bills or bits of other Bills: it’s by forcing the Government to go to the country and the only way you can do that is by cutting off its monetary supply’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sir Owen Dixon: “… if a difficulty arises between the executive government and the Parliament it shall be resolved in an appeal to the people, and we place on the representative of the Sovereign the responsibility of saying whether the case is one for the dissolution of Parliament and a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Deakin (Debates, 30 March 1897, p. 295) said that if Government’s money bills are vetoed by the Senate there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span>: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In March 1 975 in relation to supply for Medibank, he is reported as saying: ‘If there is again a refusal of a supply bill there will certainly be an <span class="highlight">election</span> but we see some marvellous issues, to fight on, not the least Medibank’ … ‘I don’t seek a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You have previously told me that you would never resign or advise an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives or a double dissolution . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Believing that the Constitution appeared to give the Senate this power (even though you might have thought its actions wrong), knowing that a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> would in all probability not solve the problem, knowing that you were after all choosing a course which in the circumstances and the Constitution permitted of sending the whole Parliament to the people and confronted with a choice- would you have thought it unreasonable to take this course?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From memory, I think we actually had it in our policy speech in the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting I was reminding the Senate of the promise that the Prime Minister made during his <span class="highlight">election</span> speech on 27 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pointing out also the extent of the exposure and public scrutiny which our health insurance program received prior to the introduction of the legislation which brought about what is now known and what has been known for over 12 months as Medibank, It was subjected to  Vh  years of public debate and at least 3 elections- those in 1972, 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Undertakings were given by the Government during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that it would ensure that the income of pensioners would at all times be commensurate with the movement in the cost of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A carefully orchestrated campaign during and after the latest Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> has harped on cruel cutbacks to social services the Fraser Government allegedly planned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When  Mr Fraser  was conducting his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year he said, as we all well know now: ‘We will maintain Medibank’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We did riot believe that Medibank would be changed, because  Mr Fraser  had given an undertaking when, during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, he said that Medibank:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Government mean that between July 1977 and the time of the general <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1978 inflation is going to increase by 33 per cent? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the present time the Government sees no reason why this schedule cannot be achieved within the time span suggested by the Prime Minister in his policy speech delivered prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> held in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I equally believe that it is a pity there is not more student participation in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of office bearers on campus so that we get a truer reflection of the nature and attitudes of students and a greater student participation in decision making. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Labor Government assumed office in 1972 no provision was made for isolated children’s grants and no provision for isolated children’s grants was made in the Budget that was passed by the previous Government before the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Government starts to make repairs, even if they are running repairs, as they will be, the closer we get to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, there will be a tremendous amount of catching up to do on the administrative side before it can even put people back into employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  who was then the Leader of the Opposition, made it perfectly clear that it would take a period of time- in fact it would probably take a period of up to 3 years- to restore to a normal state the shattered economy which we had inherited from the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Take a look at the rural policy of this Government at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in my policy speech for the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, the preservation of the importance of the individual person in a free society is the paramount aim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761013_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, the Tasmanian Government is going to make certain tax concessions, no doubt in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, will the Minister agree that the Federal Government’s policy on federalism, as it affects the States, was very much an issue in the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> last May as a result of which the Liberal-Country Party Government of that State was defeated after it had been in office for 1 1 years? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was asked whether federalism was raised as an issue in the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was, and there was an attempt to raise the same issue in the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> the Wran Government won narrowly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were an <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales today, that Government would be defeated overwhelmingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761014_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the December, 1975, <span class="highlight">election</span> we believed that the Prime Minister was referring to the original form of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Country parties- a policy on which we went to the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year and a policy which my predecessor carried out and which I certainly will carry out- to consult with the RSL on any matters concerning changes in the whole repatriation system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He would also be aware of the fact that in 1 975 there was to be- in fact there was- an <span class="highlight">election</span> held in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been only one <span class="highlight">election</span> in which this policy was specifically in issue and that was the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span> in May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Colston  said earlier, already the federalism policy of this Government has been rejected by the electors of New South Wales at the only <span class="highlight">election</span> at which the policy was specifically in issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would certainly hope that in Tasmania and Western Australia the federalism policy becomes an issue in the State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me conclude this part of my speech by saying that democracy in Queensland seems to be operating very vigorously indeed and this was particularly evident in an <span class="highlight">election</span> held not long ago when the Labor Party was decimated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elections for the Queensland Parliament are held frequently as indeed they are for other State parliaments, and as I understand it common law is alive and well. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should remind the people of Australia who are listening to this broadcast and my friends opposite that after the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland, even though the Labor Party was supported by the great white hope of those days, the then Prime Minister, it succeeded in winning only 1 1 seats or, as has been perhaps somewhat uncharitably suggested, a mere cricket team. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be that as it may, I suggest that the people of Queensland at the next State <span class="highlight">election</span> will pass judgment on this question of civil rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the basis of the Lourigan dispute was a general feeling in the party that the State ALP needed a shake-up following recent dismal <span class="highlight">election</span> performances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There were suggestions last night that he might be offered ALP endorsement for a State seat at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have done precisely what we undertook to do before the general <span class="highlight">election</span> in the field of privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We seek an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the local government bodies in the States, in accordance with a method determined by the Council of Local Government Associations, of the 6 local government representatives on the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How those States determine the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> is a matter for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my own State of South Australia the State Government has been endeavouring for a long time to have a common roll so that every person entitled to vote in a State or a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> is entitled to vote in local government elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless you are a ratepayer you are unable to vote in local government elections or to stand for local government except when you have a property in joint ownership- that is, a property held by the husband and wife- and there is an anomaly there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought I would be included on the roll for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, but when I went to vote I was told: ‘No, you are not entitled to vote because you did not notify the council that you wanted to be on the roll’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the number of people who stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to local government councils in South Australia is restricted because of the difficulties outlined by  Senator McLaren-  I accept what he said- at this point of time it is curable entirely by the State Government of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that the Government in South Australia has tried to give every person over the age of 1 8 the right to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to local government or to vote for the candidate of his choice at such elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of an Australian Labor Party government that  Senator Murphy,  the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, altered that rule and question time went for one hour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In May 1976 when the Premier was in Mt Larcom campaigning for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> for Port Curtis he extended an invitation for a deputation from the Mt Larcom Protest Group comprising the  Chairman, Mr George  Lucke and four delegates (of which I was one) to meet him and  Mr Camm  in Brisbane to discuss our problems on the 24th June 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Mr Petersen  was travelling around, meeting the people, prior to the May by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in Port Curtis, he very affably told us he felt for us and our problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shortly before the May by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, about thirty members of our Group decided not to vote in protest at the handling of our case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Petersen also made the comment, ‘We didn’t do any good in the by-<span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a recent by-<span class="highlight">election</span> the politicians all put forward their versions of how we should be treated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the Government’s failure to carry out its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to legislate for immediate and automatic increases in pensions and benefits in line with the Consumer Price Index; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government made great play of this proposal in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser repeatedly during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign lauded this approach. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was one of the most clearly spelled out intentions of the Government during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has been willing to go back on its clear <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the sitting was suspended, in discussing the Social Services Amendment Bill and the Repatriation Amendment Bill, I had been pointing out that the provision in the legislation for indexation of pensions to movements in the consumer price index did not fulfil the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise made by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find that the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to make pension rises automatic have come to pass and will soon be a reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were not in government for even 1 8 months when we had to face an <span class="highlight">election</span> again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We had to face the people at an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If what is happening now is any criterion, and I have figures with me, in the next 2 years- the government has had nearly a year in office nowthere will have to be a dramatic turnabout if it is to achieve in 3 years what it said it would achieve; and if it does not achieve it in the next 2 years we will be sitting on that side of the chamber after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and Government senators will be back over here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government did so in the hope that pensioners would forget all of the wrong things that it had done and vote for that Government on <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 5 October 1972, another magnificent increase of $1.75 a week was granted, as the McMahon Government came nearer to the <span class="highlight">election</span> date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first part of the amendment refers to the Government’s failure to carry out its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to legislate for immediate and automatic increases in pensions and benefits in line with the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761021_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suspect, from the reply just given by  Senator Withers,  that his visit to Tasmania with  Senator Webster  indicated their great concern about the prospects of the Liberal Opposition in the forthcoming State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask: What progress has been made on the Government’s proposals to seek a wage freeze for 6 months in its endeavour to produce a consumer price index figure for the next 2 quarters more in keeping with its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to arrest inflation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if people in the community had understood it they would have been less angry with the Labor Government than they subsequently proved to be at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most honourable senators can probably remember the wild, extravagant undertakings that were given by this present Government before the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s failure to live up to its <span class="highlight">election</span> undertakings and its failure to deliver the goods in the agricultural sector are just small components of its overall failure to live up to its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I challenge honourable senators opposite to go to the people again now just 17 months from the date of their <span class="highlight">election</span>, in the way they forced the Whitlam Government to go to the people, to see what the result would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us have a look at what  Mr Fraser  had to say in his statement on the economy prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all the assurances that were given in the past, at the time leading up to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, on how the States would be given more decision-making powers and how they would be better off under federalism- many of the State Premiers believed early this year that they would be getting a better deal- now as the truth seeps through all the State Premiers are objecting to the arrangements which the Commonwealth is forcing upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This plan is nothing more than an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become increasingly obvious that what has happened is that the plans we have all known about for some time and which have been going ahead to prepare for an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 4 December have now been taken to the stage where  Mr Neilson  had to find an issue, had to find something that might make him look a little bit more like a competent Premier and less the way he has appeared during his time as Premier of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy by a desperate Government to pinch from here and to pinch from there, to put up windmills to be tilted at, with a view to being able to distract people from the real truth about Tasmania and the incompetence of the Government which has been administering it for the last 4 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find it being suggested that this plan, which is merely an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick in Tasmania produced to confuse and bemuse people who will not be confused by it, should be applied throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So the horrible story goes- a story of the last 12 months of deliberately hoarding $4.5m for an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier has been going around handing it out in $500, $1000 and $5000 lots to every organisation in the State that wants to hold out its hand for some money just before the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This money is not being spent in the best interests of the State; it is being spent in the best interests of the Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It makes it very easy to look to the fact that perhaps after 4 December or after next May or whenever the State <span class="highlight">election</span> may be held, one of the worst aspects of the unemployment problem which the new Liberal Government will have to consider will be to find some sorts of employment opportunities for a number of members of the State Labor Party who have been sitting in Parliament waiting for the Liberal Party to tell them what they can do by way of producing a Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of December 1975 the present Government knew all about unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Street,  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign statements, said: ‘We have a 4-point plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign there was mention of specific plans for Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was on I, and other Labor people, said: ‘Let us see these plans in writing’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that they were not printed because the <span class="highlight">election</span> had come too soon, but they were in preparation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not seen a plan since the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sort of slanging and the sort of personal denigration that we have had of  Mr Neilson  this afternoon have at least given us warning of what we can expect in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign between now and next May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It certainly embarrassed one of his candidates in the State <span class="highlight">election</span>, a distinguished Launceston banker, who no doubt has ambitions of being Treasurer of Tasmania if the Liberal Party should ever win in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rae  said that the State Government has made handouts to various groups just because an <span class="highlight">election</span> was coming up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did he think that that was a miserable handout which was made because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is coming up or does he think it was made because those people desperately needed assistance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Rae  tried in his contribution to discredit these proposals on the ground that they were an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that it was an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy by a desperate government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attempt by the Tasmanian Government to create employment opportunities has been denigrated this afternoon by  Senator Rae  who accused it of tilting at windmills, using the situation as an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy, or an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He condemns it as being an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy and on the other hand he says that it was Liberal policy that had been pinched by  Mr Neilson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when the Tasmanian State <span class="highlight">election</span> is held the people of Tasmania will remember the way Government senators were under riding instructions and carried them out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had explained the reasons why they opposed it and the type of tactics that they had been adopting and that we can expect them to adopt during the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Less than 3 months after that <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Prime Minister was not saying that a national government was responsible for unemployment but he was trying to lay the blame on the newly elected Labor Government in New South Wales which had not even met to put forward its legislative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1949 took place- it was equally as climacteric as the <span class="highlight">election</span> of December last year- we set out as a Liberal Party and Country Party coalition to raise the standard of living in Australia by increasing to the maximum the wealth that this country was capable of producing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realise that an <span class="highlight">election</span> of either the House of Representatives or this chamber is not scheduled for this year so naturally there would be a reduction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the matter that I wish to raise tonight is the electoral provisions for <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators and therefore the departmental costs involved as dealt with in division 133. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Minister Tor Administrative Services, relates to the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> for 10 senators for New South Wales in which there was an initial count and a recount. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not argue about the capacity of the electoral officers; what I do argue is that the system of <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate at the moment places undue and needless strain on the staff of the Australian Electoral Office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975 and previously in 1974 they were confronted with a huge task in determining which candidates would be successful in the Senate poll not only in New South Wales but also in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was the original count, that is, the preliminary count following the elections; then there was a recheck that took place over the Christmas holiday period; and, finally, as I said there was the first full recount under this system since 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A document entitled <span class="highlight">Election</span> Statistics for New South Wales was given to all honourable senators recently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit again that if the votes were recounted today the totals would probably be altered because of the near impossible task given to the officials of the Australian Electoral Office in scrutinising the votes of 53 candidates in the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975 and, perhaps even worse, the votes for 73 candidates who stood for New South Wales in 1 974.I think it should be mentioned also that because there was a complete recount there was also a new random sample. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The book on <span class="highlight">election</span> statistics that was given out in this place the other day showed a farcical situation in that the preferences of the Social <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meant that the donkey vote was over 25 000 in New South Wales at that last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of things have been raised about what should be done in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been suggested that the deposit required of Senate candidates should be raised to $1,000, This would eliminate some of the nonsense candidates who appeared in 1974 and in the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761103_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the recent United States presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Carter  seemed to indicate quite different priorities with regard to trade from those of the policy presently practised by that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens in <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns is that people are prone to make statements about what they are going to do and perhaps life turns out slightly differently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill fulfils the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But whether that is so or not, Labor fought the last <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue that the Senate, a State House, has no right to take action to dismiss a people ‘s elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973, the then Minister for Labor, the Honourable Clyde Cameron, introduced amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which had the effect of requiring the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the holder of each office in an organisation by direct vote of the appropriate section of the membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An exception from this requirement was permitted in relation to those offices of a part-time nature on an organisation’s federal committee of management where the rules of the organisation provided, before the commencement of the amendment, a form of <span class="highlight">election</span> other than by direct vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, however, that direct <span class="highlight">election</span> is not, in all situations, a guarantee of proper democratic control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the amendment of the Act in 1973, there has been widespread public discussion and the development of active lobbies for and against direct elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to offices, the duties of which are not full time in nature, the position whereby organisations may adopt a direct <span class="highlight">election</span>, onetier or a multiple-tier system of collegiate <span class="highlight">election</span>, for example, a system whereby the conference or council which is elected by direct vote may elect from its members another body which then elects from its members the part time officers, will be restored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that either direct <span class="highlight">election</span> or a one-tier collegiate electoral system proposed for full-time offices will reduce the chances of this occurring and is, at the same time, consistent with the principle of fullest participation by members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both cases, there is a directness, or nexus, between the exercise of the individual member’s vote and the <span class="highlight">election</span> of full-time officers, to make effective participation by individual members a reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time the arrangements which organisations choose for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of part-time officers will still be subject to review by the Industrial Court upon application by an aggrieved member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the Bill proposes that the Act be amended to delete from the definition of ‘Office’ in section 4 those positions the duties of which are substantially similar to positions for which elections are required to be conducted, and positions which have duties substantially similar to offices for which elections are required to be conducted under rules in force prior to the 1973 amendments to the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of the amendments will be to restore the situation prior to the 1973 amendments of the Act; that is, organisations will be able to appoint persons to them without the necessity of providing for their <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is his trip to Canberra nothing but a panic measure to try to find an issue for an <span class="highlight">election</span> that he will lose, according to my calculations, by 5 seats? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed that it was being somewhat stage managed, because it is fairly obvious that already he has taken a decision to hold an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By way of preface I refer to a statement made by the Assistant Commissioner of the Australia Police, Superintendent J. Davies, in respect of the letter bombs which were sent to  Mr Fraser, Mr Bjelke-Petersen  and  Sir John  Kerr during the course of the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: As nearly a year has elapsed since these events and in view of the widely held belief at the time that the letter bombs were not intended to harm those to whom they were sent, since notoriously such personages do not open their own mail, but to harm the Labor Party, has there been any outcome of the ‘all-out law enforcement effort to find the culprit’, or was the matter quietly dropped after the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, his visit is not simply because there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Tasmania on 4 December but also arises out of other matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore assume and hope that the Premier’s visit here arises out of the discussion between the Prime Minister and the Premier in Hobart and not simply out of some desire to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 4 December next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 12 December 1975, which was the day before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government,  Sir Brian  Massy-Greene, who is  chairman  of the company, visited the Department of Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is also coincidental that the Premier of Tasmania, I understand, said that if his 24-point plan were not accepted by the Prime Minister today he would call an immediate State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held on Saturday, 4 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position, halls are being booked, newspaper space is being booked, and all the things that normally are done before an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign are being done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So everything is being orchestrated for the <span class="highlight">election</span> to take place on that day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Premier of Tasmania is in Canberra today hoping that he can obtain an excuse to say: ‘I really did not want an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because the Prime Minister has been so wicked to me I must go back to Tasmania and hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> right away’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been able to reduce taxes hither and thither, obviously working up to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was delighted to read in the Press the other day that during the course of the previous day the 2 opposing parties in the Tasmanian Parliament came together despite even the impending <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So great was  Mr Neilson  ‘s concern that he sat on the information he had for 6 days, doing nothing but preparing to use it in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign stunt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that the first thing  Senator Withers  did was by implication to accuse  Senator Harradine  of staging this debate for the purposes of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the State Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of showing concern he spent half an hour rubbishing the previous Labor Government, rubbishing the State Government and carrying on as though the State <span class="highlight">election</span> had started and the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unpalatable fact for the Government Parties, in respect of which they now seek retribution against the Australian Broadcasting Commission, is that in the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign it was only Australian Broadcasting Commission interviewers who asked the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  questions which should have been asked by any intelligent political interviewer anywhere in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Rather than have an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the wet and to get a proper electoral system I extended the Committee’s period of operation from the 2 years for which it was appointed for a further 9 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Committee were due to come up for <span class="highlight">election</span>, I believe, in March of this year, but we find that there has been no provision to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year for the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the increase in revenue is not compensated for by the hardship caused to families who, without much prior warning, and certainly with no prior warning by the coalition parties before the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>, have to face these vast increases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The real issues of industrial relations in Australia are not necessarily the methods of <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials or catering for the wishes of minority interests in trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the question of union elections, the present system of voting for office holders is by direct vote of members of the union in respect of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of full time officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are differences of opinion within the trade union movement and within employer organisations operating in the industrial field as to the desirability of alternative systems of voting for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that in 1973 when the Labor Government introduced the legislation providing for direct <span class="highlight">election</span> of officials, it was not voted against or opposed by the then Opposition which now finds it a subject of condemnation and necessarily requiring change in the year 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All through the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns which followed in 1974 and in 1975, references were made by people such as  Mr Fraser  and later by  Mr Street  to the desirability of membership control of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been common knowledge in industrial relations circles in this country for a period of about 6 months that it was the Government’s intention to reintroduce as an alternative to direct <span class="highlight">election</span> a system of collegiate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not even clear from the legislation whether the provisions which the Government now seeks to introduce apply to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of branch officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not clear whether the principle which the Minister enunciates applies both to elections for organisations and for branches themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important emphasis which was stressed by Government Ministers at that time was the involvement of the members of the union themselves in those elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to us strange that at this stage in a variety of ways the members of the unions will no longer be directly involved in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of their officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True, they will participate in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of an electorate college in some circumstances and that itself is subject to qualification. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the grave difficulties which an elected officer of a trade union faces and one of the grave responsiblities which he assumes that by virtue of his office and his <span class="highlight">election</span> he is entitled to do certain things; indeed, he is bound to do certain things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has been on the federal council of the Federated Clerks Union for 22 years without having had to face an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that legislation it was provided that individual unions could decide for themselves the system that they would select for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of office bearers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been followed in this legislation by providing in 3 circumstances for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of full-time office bearers, a system whereby a union can decide upon a direct vote, or through a one-tier collegiate voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final point which seems to me to be of great importance in this legislation, and which of course would lead to greater efficiency in trade union affairs, is that the definition of ‘office’ has been amended in order to provide for appointment rather than <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Button  made the point that because such an officer would not be submitting himself to <span class="highlight">election</span>, in some way this would detract from the rights of individuals to get their views across to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not by appointment, it is by <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These people gain their positions by <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this circumstance they will come up for <span class="highlight">election</span> at the proper time, and of course they can be removed from office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government proposes to reintroduce the collegiate system for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers as an alternative to the direct vote of the total membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous Labor Government’s commitment to democratic control of trade unions prompted the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1973 which have been referred to and which provided direct <span class="highlight">election</span> of full time officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the relevant clause of the 1 973 legislation which provided for the direct <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials was agreed to by the Opposition in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the present Government went on a union-bashing campaign during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One should look at the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, for example, and at the percentage of members who vote in that union’s elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Federal  President  of the Organisation, John Peter Maynes, was elected to the Federal Council in approximately 1950 in an <span class="highlight">election</span> by the Victorian Branch membership as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although remaining at ali times qualified to nominate as a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position of Federal  President  pursuant to Rule 22 (2) (d) (ti)  Mr Maynes  has not been required by the existing Rules to re-submit himself as a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position of Federal Councillor at any time since he first assumed office as Federal  President  in 1954. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian Branch records were falsified to secure his <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, as  Senator Button  said earlier, with the 1 5 per cent proviso now  Mr Carmichael  will probably never have to face <span class="highlight">election</span> again from the rank and file. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This situation was changed by a court-controlled ballot after a 31 -day court case established that falsified ballot-papers were used in a previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Previously a union member who wanted a vote had to apply for a ballot-paper and prove that he could not attend the meeting where the voting was to take place, with the result that some elections for the New South Wales branch were held and decided by under 200 members, not under Electoral Office control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is protecting his privileged position, but at the same time it is entrenching the very militants whom it was attacking in its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that I should reiterate that the Government does not actually condemn the direct method of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a question of condemning that sort of <span class="highlight">election</span> of a trade union representative or of any other representative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The difficult proposition is to answer that question, to find the best method by which a measure of real democracy can be called upon to result in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of those people whom the great mass of the unionists require to lead them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761110_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2) 1976 last evening I was drawing attention to the fact that it was immensely necessary that we establish a method of <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers in the conciliation and arbitration system that permitted the greatest possible number of members of Australian unions at the grass roots level to take a real part in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of those people who are to negotiate for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the legislation goes a significant distance in the direction of establishing in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of trade union members and in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers of other organisations and associations, a circumstance which will tend to have a reasonable measure of flexibility about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act contained in this Bill seek to implement 2 methods, and consequently a choice, of <span class="highlight">election</span>- direct <span class="highlight">election</span> or <span class="highlight">election</span> by a one-tier collegiate system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of part time officials it provides for <span class="highlight">election</span> by direct method, by a one-tier collegiate system or by a multiple-tier collegiate system, which is the circumstance that applied prior to 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first was the provision that all ballots were to be conducted by rank and file <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unions which were still operating under the collegiate system were given a period of 3 years to change their rules and to provide for rank and file elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And of course they were aided and abetted by the media in their attempt to confuse the electorate about what went on in union elections and what the Cameron legislation provided for. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To encourage this, the Liberal-National Country Party Government would provide secret ballots under Commonwealth Electoral Office supervision for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers to elected positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of Australia’s most powerful unions are now controlled by officials who have gained their positions as a result of <span class="highlight">election</span> at which only a very small percentage of members entitled to vote did in fact cast their vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal and National Country Parties wholeheartedly supported these demands and would introduce legislation as soon as possible for secret ballots for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of trade union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be hoping to press for as early as possible the important matter in the policy speech, secret ballots for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officials of industrial organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting that it comes up right at this time, because we are now at the end of the 3 years prescribed in the Cameron legislation of 1973, during which time all unions would have to adopt the rank and file method of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the legislation before us they will not have to change to rank and file <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me it is crystal clear that this Government has ‘done a deal’ with the Santamaria/National Civic Council group and has ‘sold out’ thousands of Australian unionists who  saw, in the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> industrial promises of this Government, an opportunity to place their own acceptance or rejection on whom would be the Federal Officials of a number of Australian Trade Unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is, however, that direct <span class="highlight">election</span> is not, in all situations, a guarantee of proper democratic control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can it be that a system of <span class="highlight">election</span> which allows every member of a union a voice is less democratic than a collegiate system which does not allow every member a direct voice in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there is a kind of choice but who will exercise that choice as to whether there be a rank and file <span class="highlight">election</span> or collegiate system <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision in the legislation for rank and file ballots as to what kind of <span class="highlight">election</span> that union will have subsequently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the pre- 1973 legislation, the multi-tier collegiate system, has been reintroduced for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of part-time officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that this constitutes a further erosion of the right of rank and file participation in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of those who will perform the duties of officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this is another means by which the controlling faction of any particular union can strengthen and reinforce its position without recourse to <span class="highlight">election</span> by the rank and file membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly the amendment introduced during the course of the debate in another place which provided that 15 per cent of the Federal college should not have to face re-<span class="highlight">election</span> after they are once elected is another way of eroding the rights of rank and file membership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that the action that the Government has taken already by making amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, particularly earlier in the year when we started off by introducing the requirement for a compulsory postal secret ballot for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials, is an attempt to encourage the trade union rank and file members to take an interest in their leadership and to deal with those who are not acting in their best interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my view that the Government has done a complete somersault on its promises during the campaign for <span class="highlight">election</span> in December last year, when it made non-interference with trade union affairs part of its platform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-3">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is also strange that in 1973 not one of the then Opposition senators opposed the legislation to change the Act so that the rank and file members would have a greater say in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of their officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that  Senator Steele  Hall and  Senator Jessop,  who have criticised the trade union over disputes, stoppages and so on, would have been among the first to support legislation that sought to create harmony within the trade union movement and not to reverse the legislation which was supported unanimously by the then Senate Opposition and which changed the Act so as to give greater participation by the rank and file members in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the officials of their union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has made it clear for at least 6 months now that it had accepted in principle a form of collegiate voting for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of trade union officials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 the then Minister for Labor,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, brought in amendments to provide that within 3 years the elections of not only the full time officials but anybody who was then carrying out functions similar to the role of those officials, should all be elected by the direct voting system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is strange that the Labor senators in this debate should have attached such enormous significance to this particular method of ensuring the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the leadership of trade unions because, as I have said, from 1904 until 1973 trade unions had been free to adopt the alternative method of collegiate voting for their leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it was a one-tier system or a multi-tier system, for 70-odd years that had been accepted as a perfectly democratic form of <span class="highlight">election</span> for union leadership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this Bill requires that if a union adopts a one-tier collegiate system there must be a secret postal ballot for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every office within the organisation or branch for the filling of which an <span class="highlight">election</span> is required to be conducted within the organisation or branch and any position within the organisation or branch involving duties substantially similar to the duties of such an office; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may not have done so completely but in 1973 it changed its rules at the federal level so that all the members throughout Australia received a ballot paper in the rank and file <span class="highlight">election</span> for their fully paid officers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>means a method of <span class="highlight">election</span> comprising a first stage, at which persons are elected to a number of offices by a direct voting system - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it seems clear to me that full time officials can be elected under a collegiate type <span class="highlight">election</span>, which is provided for in this Bill by the rank and file voting for the college and then that college electing persons by and from the people elected at the first stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only qualification to that is provided for in clause 3 (d) which specifies that a number of persons not exceeding 15 per cent of the total number of members of the body- those members having had to be elected originally in the college and having been elected to a full time position such as secretary- may in future years be re-elected, even though that re-<span class="highlight">election</span> is not by the rank and file, as members of a college. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who thought these issues had been settled by the result of the 13 December <span class="highlight">election</span> last year should be disabused of that illusion by the publication of 2 important books this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to be a logic that is related to the fact that, having been through an <span class="highlight">election</span> in which the centralism and federalism concepts were major problems and major elements for discussion and determination by the electorate and having witnessed the Australian electorate come down strongly, in common with most democratic societies around the world today, in favour of the federalist concept and all that it means to State and local governments, he now chooses to take a position whereby he will seek to destroy the effective implementation of legislation which can only be of benefit to the States and to local government areas in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all well recall that throughcut the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Fraser philosophy pledged the Government to new federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the window dressing for the new federalism had great appeal during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was <span class="highlight">election</span> ballyhoo designed primarily to deceive the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not need to remind the Senate that in 1952  Mr Menzies  fought and won an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the ballyhoo that he would put value back into the pound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We saw that developed to a great extent during the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This new federalism which the present Government featured so prominently before its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign commenced and during its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign has now been revealed and is recognised by every State government in Australia with the exception of my own State of Western AustraliaI will say a bit more about that later- as a confidence trick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Scott  has spoken in this debate, since the question of new federalism was a central, if not the central, issue in the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held on 1 May and which much to the consternation of the Liberal Party resulted in the defeat of the then Liberal Government and the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government which was campaigning vigorously against the new federalism, and since I understand that  Senator Scott  has received a telegram from the Premier of that State asking him to vote against this Bill- given that on 1 May the people of New South Wales also voted against this legislation- it will be interesting to see how  Senator Scott  votes on this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761116_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have legislated to require a secret postal ballot for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of holders of offices having policy or management functions in industrial organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is fair to say, as  Senator Withers  acknowledged in his statement on this matter last Tuesday, that since the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Opposition has set out to co-operate with the Government in securing the passage of the Government’s legislative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, in the policy statement presented before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the then joint Opposition Parties said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out in my speech during the second reading debate, an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held in early 1953, and in April 1954 legislation was introduced which provided for a commencement date of 1 January 1954 to make up for the delay which had occurred because of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The regular increase had been delayed by an <span class="highlight">election</span> in late 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year, the Government reviewed the rates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has a policy and a commitment from the last <span class="highlight">election</span> which I think is well worth reading in regard to the preservation of the National Estate and other conservation measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That was a member of the Liberal Party stating the type of philosophy to which all honourable senators opposite ought to be dedicated if the things they said during the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign were ever to have been taken at face value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be recalled that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  predicted during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would devalue the dollar if confirmed in office at the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He might have particular reasons for so doing, because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is just around the corner in that State and is due to be held on 1 1 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Treasurer then proceeded to castigate the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  who, to quote from the Treasurer’s statement, predicted during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would devalue the dollar if confirmed in office at the <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a very real manifestation of the growing recognition throughout Australia of the validity and strength of Aboriginal society- which, I might add, is clearly acknowledged in the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy statement of the Government parties on Aboriginal affairs which recognises a special obligation ‘to provide opportunities for Aborigines to preserve their traditions, languages and customs from further encroachment and destruction where possible ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its belief in this matter Will be as fallacious as its previous beliefs that the very fact of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal-Country Party government would lead us out of economic recession, the belief that we were going to have an investment-led recovery, spurred on by the useless and scandalously costly investment allowances, the belief that consumer recovery was under way and the fantasy after fantasy which have been produced by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister and which, without exception, have been contradicted by the subsequent revelation of the facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761201_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Minister for Agriculture, I can assure you that on <span class="highlight">election</span> to Government on December 13, 1 will ensure that priority will be given to the problems of the fruit industry and strong representations will be made overseas on behalf of Australia’s apple producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what a member of the Government of which he is a supporter said a few months ago in relation to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales, but the Labor Party did win office in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A matter of weeks after the <span class="highlight">election</span> he came forward with an announcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite this, our trade relationships in this area have deteriorated so much that we were not even consulted when the arbitrary decision was made at the height of a big <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>True, there was <span class="highlight">election</span> fever and the decision was made for pragmatic reasons; but, if that is the way friends behave, who needs enemies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Gietzelt  and I had a quite amicable chat across the chamber about this when I observed that I thought part of the problem at the moment with Japan and the United States was the fact that they were involved in <span class="highlight">election</span> situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of those Bills should have been on the business paper earlier this year, if we are to believe the rhetoric and the propaganda upon which the Government based its campaign against the Whitlam Government in 1 975 and its subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of November-December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761202_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are we not rapidly reaching the position where unless some such initiative is taken it will be impossible to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1 977 or even in 1 978? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The priorities as well as the credibility of this Government can be judged by the Minister’s own statement before last year’s <span class="highlight">election</span> when he was in Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not think anything can be said other than that  Mr Sinclair  and the Government have not kept their word and that this is another pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise which has been broken by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not done this, in spite of its <span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Sinclair  on 8 May 1974 said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then again during the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Sinclair  repeated his previous false assertion that the Labor Party would, if elected, immediately eliminate the bounty and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761203_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think Australians realised at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that the need was to get Australia back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, December 1975, Australia’s inflation rate was over 1 7 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, with the galloping inflation rate, with costs increasing rapidly week by week and with wages increasing, many small businesses went broke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This is an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Liberal and National Country Parties which is now being implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The facts of our economic situation as it is today, which has been brought about after 12 months of a Liberal-National Country Party coalition, are these: Unemployment has risen by 40 000 people; the deficit about which we heard so much from  Mr Fraser,  the Leader of the Liberal Party, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the deficit which had to be reduced at all costs, the deficit which for the coalition Parties was the most telling evidence of the incompetence of the Labor Government, is now at $5,000m, which is greater than it ever was under a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government said during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and has said many times since that it will not desert the needs of the elderly citizens of our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example, in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of November and December of last year the Prime Minister of the caretaker Government promised that wage indexation would be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of November and December of last year the then Prime Minister promised his friends in the business community that the Prices Justification Tribunal would be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is appalling about this is the adhockery of it all and the fact that it has been done to justify broken promises in relation to the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of last year and that it has been done in an economic situation which has totally changed, particularly as a result of the devaluation of a week or so ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761206_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister tell me whether the Prime Minister is really interested in the tourist industry, remembering the policy that he came out with at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, then forgot about, then the Government committee was appointed and now he is apparently ursurping its position with the appointment of a select committee? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761207_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now ask the Leader: Has his attention been drawn to an article in yesterday’s  Australian Financial Review  in which  Mr Len  Reason,  chairman  of the Masius advertising agency which devised the Liberal Party 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> slogan ‘Turn on the Lights’, is now claiming that because of the Government’s inability to find the correct combination of switches, and of the many shocks and short-circuits, the Government is finding great difficulty in turning on the lights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I did say was that the new Government, after its <span class="highlight">election</span> on 13 December last, showed no indication of bringing on land rights legislation of any sort at any time despite the famous Ellicott promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-60-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government has also accepted the Royal Commission’s recommendation that a practice should be established permitting the Leader of the Opposition, before a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, to confer with the Public Service Board and the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and permitting shadow Ministers to confer with the heads of relevant departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-70">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government also promised to reduce the burden of income tax on firms and companies which, because of inflation, have had to find increasing amounts of working capital to maintain business activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-74">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can recall that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign one of the more primitive members of the coalition- a man named Nixon, who I believe is the Minister for something or other- was sounding off about the necessity to gag the ABC during the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-85-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the weeks immediately following the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975, several hundred million dollars of private capital flowed out of the country- mainly due to a widespread belief that the Australian exchange rate was overvalued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761210_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Labor is trying to convince the public through a rather determined propaganda exercise that unemployment is somehow related to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Liberal Government on 13 December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1973- the year following Labor’s <span class="highlight">election</span> to office- using constant dollars, $3 50m was spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-35-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court’s view was that this means that the number of members to be chosen in the several States must be determined in time for each ordinary general <span class="highlight">election</span> and that such elections must be held in accordance with the entitlements so determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Court recognised that this mandatory principle would not apply in the case of elections other than ordinary general elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Howeverand this is a most important point to note- in the case of an ordinary general <span class="highlight">election</span>, if a State has not been divided into the appropriate number of divisions which accords with the determined representation entitlement, then that ordinary general <span class="highlight">election</span> will be conducted ‘at large’ for that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Representation Amendment Bill also provides that a determination of the representation entitlement of the several States will be made within 30 days of the Bill receiving Royal Assent and further that the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives will be conducted on the basis of the representation entitlement as disclosed by that determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since our <span class="highlight">election</span> to Government, appointments to positions of permanent head have been made in conformity with the principles behind the legislation, although initially formal committees were not set up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we allow welfare development in this country to continue to grow like Topsy, as it has done for 77 years, and if we go on adding bits and pieces here in response to some articulate group around <span class="highlight">election</span> time or out of a desire to do something nice in a Budget the contents of which are otherwise unpleasant, the shambles will get worse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This doubt will be removed by the present proposal because under the new provisions a Senator’s term of service will commence on the day of his <span class="highlight">election</span>, rather than on the first day of July after the <span class="highlight">election</span> as is at present provided in section 13 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under the existing section a person so chosen would not hold office beyond the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> of Members of the House of Represenatives or the next <span class="highlight">election</span> of Senators for his State, whichever first happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fifth paragraph provides for a situation in which a vacancy had occurred in the place of a  Senator chosen  by the people of a State at the last elections and, at the date when the new provision is to take effect, there is no person currently filling that place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this will be that a person chosen by a State Parliament after the commencement to fill a place that was vacant at the commencement will hold office for the balance of the term of the  Senator who  had been chosen by the people- instead of being limited as at present until the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> of Members of the House of Represenatives or the next <span class="highlight">election</span> of Senators for the State, whichever first happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present position is that such a replacement  Senator would  not hold office beyond the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Members of the House of Representatives or until the next <span class="highlight">election</span> of Senators for the State, whichever first happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That this Convention affirms the principle that a casual vacancy in the Senate which occurs by reason of the death of a senator or the disqualification or resignation of a senator caused by bona fide illness or incapacity should, in order to maintain the principle of proportional representation and the wishes of the people of the State at the relevant Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, be filled by a member of the same political party as the senator whose vacancy is to be filled but in reaffirming this principle the Convention recommends that the Constitution be amended to provide that the person elected by the Houses of Parliament of the State should hold office for the balance of the term of the senator whose place he is taking. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770217_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister, in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech in November 1975, say that only under a Liberal-National Country Party government will there be a return to business confidence and that only under a Liberal-National Country Party government will there be jobs for all who want to work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We see this legislation as being nothing more than an attempt to fulfil an <span class="highlight">election</span> slogan which went something to the effect that there would be no more jobs for the boys after the Fraser Government came into office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That appointment is a salutary reminder of the emptiness of the slogan ‘there will be no more jobs for the boys after we are elected to office’, which was, of course, a slogan used in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for saying that is that in February 1977 the Fraser Government, looking through its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises, finds that there is perhaps one which it can fulfil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It responds to an <span class="highlight">election</span> slogan but fails to introduce any new procedures which would provide for those criteria to be fundamental to the question of the selection of senior officers in the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We see this very much as a piece of political legislation designed, as I have said, to fill an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It introduces into the Australian Public Service a system of selection of permanent heads which is very much subject to the control and influence of the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board, much less subject to the influence of Ministers and the Prime Minister and very much subject to the influence not only of the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board but also of his colleagues from among permanent heads whom he selects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This so-called Simultaneous Elections referendum is the first one of four which the Government is holding with the Senate elections, and in each one the Government has deliberately attempted to mislead you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government also hopes these referendums will put a smokescreen over the central issues of the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What were the central issues of the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to be? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution, the law, and parliamentary practice allow each Prime Minister to have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> on the same day as any Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He can have the House of Representatives and Senate elections on the same day simply by his own decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He could have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> with the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> if he wanted to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imagine an honourable senator in this chamber sidling up to somebody in a pub and saying: ‘Mate, what do you think about the simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> proposals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770222_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-They are the laws of an organisation, not the laws which relate to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of representatives to Parliament in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Opposition opposes clause 1 1 which relates to the holding of elections at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that redistribution is ordered but in fact does not take place before the next ordinary House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, either because it has not been completed or because it has not been approved by either House of the Parliament, there shall be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst clause 1 1 of the Bill provides for the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large, it does not spell out, nor are there spelt out in any other clause of the Bill, the rules under which an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large shall be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there is doubt as to whether a redistribution can take place under the existing Act, the Minister now acknowledges that there is doubt as to whether regulations can be made to provide for the rules under which an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large can be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For those reasons we believe that the way in which an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large shall be held should be written into the Bill or into the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have already agreed- I think it is commonly conceded- that if there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large the possibilities are unimaginable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that for a government to bring in legislation of this nature, to provide for elections at large, without writing into the legislation the rules under which an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large shall be conducted, is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland said this afternoon that there are no details as to how the votes cast at an <span class="highlight">election</span> can be counted and how the <span class="highlight">election</span> can operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to get these redistribution Bills through the Senate the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers)  spoke about the essential requirements to set up a redistribution and said that the question of how an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large will be held will be decided in some further detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> taking a whole State as one electorate or multiplicity of candidates would be impossible no matter what the details were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was an unfair <span class="highlight">election</span> as the principle of one vote, one value, did not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judgment was that within each ordinary <span class="highlight">election</span> there must be a decision as to the representation of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative to having no redistribution need not be to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> with the whole State as one electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot see that there would ever be a necessity for an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the whole State if we took away from the Parliament the power to endorse or reject the Commissioners’ recommendations on electoral boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is no alteration in the State representation between ordinary elections there is no reason why a complete redistribution could not be made by ascertaining the number of entitlements for the State in the first year of the Parliament, before its 3-year term was up, if the Parliament did not have the power of endorsement or rejection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can see that on many occasions when the Senate has a majority with differing political affiliations from the majority in the House of Representatives the redistribution will not be made before the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, there will be reasons for having an <span class="highlight">election</span> taking the whole State as a boundary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would expect that at least 150 candidates would be standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales from which 44 or 45 would be elected to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the system of preferential voting operated at an <span class="highlight">election</span> at a time when one party was in favour with the electors of a State, if those electors followed the party ticket that party would win all the seats in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked whether the 6 States and the Territories could have different methods of conducting an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and I asked what voting system would be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One has only to go back to the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and take into account that there were only 53 candidates-not 153 or 300, as has been mentioned, but only 53- and that the result of that <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was held on 13 December, was not available until 6 February to appreciate that the counting under such a system of voting could not be completed before the date for the return of the writs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is the <span class="highlight">election</span> at large proposition contained in this Bill? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said as to proportionality between States that if a redistribution is not carried out there shall be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do we carry out an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a very risky operation for any government to attempt to run an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large under regulations without putting the matter into a statutory form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know the horrendous situation that would face us in an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be easier to run an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large in Tasmania than it is to run a double dissolution- five members of the House of Representatives as against 10 senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory already has elections at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is the deterrent there that if either House of the Parliament acts capriciously it is going to be faced with an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will either have to accept the proposition of the distribution commissioners or have an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large under known rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope I have satisfied everybody as to the doubts that my advisers have on the proposition of using regulations to run an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They strongly advise me and urge me that that would be a most risky thing to do because there would be the risk of having the whole <span class="highlight">election</span> declared invalid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was rather amazing to see the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers),  the Minister in charge of this Bill, stand here and say that he cannot tell the people at large in Australia what rules are to govern the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> if it is to be held in the form of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large is held, let us consider what would happen in the State of New South Wales as an example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One could safely say that it will be 30 days from the issue of the writ until the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held and then another 60 days for the return of the writ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has gone to great pains since he came to office to tell the people what a very thorough government they are under and what a thorough government has charge of the affairs of this country, yet we find that he cannot come into this place and tell us what method is to be adopted for the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is not prepared to tell us but surely he must know what his Party has in mind if an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large is to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is the Government going to conduct that <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also has to consider what some of the State Premiers might do and whether they will try to upset the Government if it tries to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Minister can give us some further explanation of how an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large is to be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand what the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers)  has said, when the McKinlay judgment was handed down in December 1975, some 15 months ago, the officers of his Department and the Commonwealth Electoral Office, which is a statutory office, started working on proposed amendments to the legislation to provide for the contingency that the High Court suggested might exist if a redistribution had not been carried out where one should have been carried out and that was for the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore whilst this Bill now provides for the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large, no other work was done in the meantime to provide for rules as to how the <span class="highlight">election</span> at large should be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am subject to correction but I infer from what the Minister said that if a redistribution drawn up as a result of the passage of this legislation is not approved by this Parliament when presented to it, the Government might look at the way in which an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large shall be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> at large may not be held at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, or the <span class="highlight">election</span> after, but one may be held at some distant point in the future and surely the Parliament and the political parties we all represent in this Parliament are entitled to know the ground rules which will apply when we run on to the field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in fact the electoral boundaries that were in existence for the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, the 1975 double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>, were those that were last drawn up and approved by Parliament in 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, if Parliament approves the boundary proposals to be put to it subsequently by the distribution commissioners after the passage of this legislation the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> will be the first one fought on boundaries approved on the 10 per cent principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commissioners to be appointed will have a tremendous responsibility because it will be up to them to make recommendations which will ensure that when the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held the party which gets the greatest number of votes or the greatest percentage of votes also gets the greatest number of seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should point out that if the redistribution proposals which are eventually submitted to Parliament for endorsement are not approved by either House the timetabling for another redistribution before the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> is due could be very acute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the legislation provides for the holding of elections at large in certain circumstances, the Bill does not set out the ground rules on how an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large shall be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, at an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large will the names of all the candidates for the whole State- the borders of the State will become the boundaries of the electorate under an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large- appear on the one ballot paper? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large to be conducted on the system of proportional representation, or is it be be the multiple preferential voting system? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that is because he is a member of the Senate and will not be a candidate for the House of Representatives under an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless a specific system is laid down to provide for the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large, the nation could be without a government and a parliament for months on end after an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though senators do not receive that allowance at this stage, I assume it would happen under an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large when the members of the House of Representatives would all be elected for an electorate larger than 5000 square kilometres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention that matter only to show the great administrative headaches which could or would occur if an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large is held without ground rules being laid down for the conduct of that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that in this legislation the Government should have spelled out the rules for the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if at the time of the next ordinary House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the redistribution has not been carried out and implemented in order to comply with the State’s determined representation entitlement then, as I said earlier, the border of the State will be the boundary of the electorate for all those entitled to represent the State in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court’s view was that this means that the number of members to be chosen in the several States must be determined in time for each ordinary general <span class="highlight">election</span> and that such elections must be held in accordance with the entitlements so determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Court recognised that this mandatory principle would not apply in the case of elections other than ordinary general elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It recognises that this area is so jolly big it is even standing 2 candidates for the next State <span class="highlight">election</span> for the one area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the commissioners, in accepting their responsibilities, will make sure that the redistribution is done on such a basis that when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held in the future the party or parties that wins by the greatest majority of voters will also win by the greatest majority of seats in the Houses of Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do so by citing to him the position that prevailed at the last national <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember that when we returned to this Parliament after the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>, I engaged in a dialogue with  Senator Withers  and referred to the need to improve and to simplify Senate voting procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite know in their hearts that, if the difference in electoral support among the Parties at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> had been reversed and a Labor Government had won on the present boundaries, the present Government Parties would not have lost the number of seats that Labor did at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this meant, for example, an infinitesimal quota for <span class="highlight">election</span> being set in New South Wales some odd people who might mean well in support of a particular cause might be elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall pick up some of the matters raised by  Senator Douglas  McClelland in the body of my speech but one curious, almost unfair, thing I must refer to is his complaint that the Minister for Administative Services  (Senator Withers)  did not set out in detail in these Bills how the elections at large should be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted that  Senator Withers  and his team have not bothered to waste their time at this stage in trying to translate the monster of the <span class="highlight">election</span> at large into something which will probably be even more monstrous if we have to see it in all its horror. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the High Court’s decision, if we did not carry out a proper redistribution when a State has a change in the number of members it is entitled to there would have to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large- an <span class="highlight">election</span> whereby all the members for that State would be elected in one large ballot- which would be a sort of monstrous three times over Senate-type poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These Bills provide the methods whereby regular determinations will be made at a certain stage after each <span class="highlight">election</span> in accordance with the High Court’s decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will know the number of seats to which a State is entitled and the preselections that are required by reason of any change in numbers can go ahead in a proper manner and will apply for the next ordinary general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regret that he trotted out again the old chestnut that his Party gained 42 per cent of the votes in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and only gained 36 per cent of the seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why such a big proportion of the seats went to those parties in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-New South Wales may have them much more frequently, but it seems to me that it will cause difficulties if there is a change every <span class="highlight">election</span> and people are moved from one electorate to another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore the matter will then go through to a redistribution which takes some dme but it will all be completed in time for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people will be able to get to know this and each party will be able to select its candidates well in advance of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was done so that, by the time an <span class="highlight">election</span> was actually held or when a subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> was held, the number of electors in that division would be appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1 1 of the Bill provides for an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large if a redistribution has not been conducted in a State in time for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No conditions are laid down under which an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large will be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it envisaged that an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large will be held under the regulation making powers in section 219 of the existing Commonwealth Electoral Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if it is not envisaged that an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large be held under regulations issued in accordance with section 219, is it possible that an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large could be held under regulations issued in accordance with that section? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer to either of those questions is yes, anyone who witnessed the events of late 1975 does not need too much imagination to visualise a situation in which a redistribution proposal for one or more States put by the commissioners could be rejected in this Parliament and then, if an <span class="highlight">election</span> is due, an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large could be held in that one or more States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held under conditions laid down by regulation, what is to prevent a government or a political party deciding in a State where it believes it can get more than 50 per cent of the votes that it will issue regulations providing for what is usually known as an exhaustive preferential ballot? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simultaneously in a different State regulations could be issued which would provide that an <span class="highlight">election</span> be held according to proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it possible that Queensland- if recent voting performance is to be taken as an indication of future voting performance the Liberal and National Country Parties could confidentally expect more than 50 per cent of the vote- could issue regulations for an exhaustive preferential ballot in an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has become necessary for a redistribution before the next <span class="highlight">election</span> because of the variation that has occurred in the number of voters within the present electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision in this legislation for a redistribution every 7 years will avoid a redistribution every time there is an <span class="highlight">election</span>, although we will find still that very soon after a redistribution another redistribution is required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clause 1 1 which causes me the greatest concern because it provides for elections at large, yet there do not seem to be any rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, could the 6 States and the Territories all have different methods of <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we used that system, would a limited percentage of the vote be required for <span class="highlight">election</span>- for instance, the 5 per cent which exists in West Germany or in the State of New South Wales, say, would candidates getting less than 3 per cent of the vote win seats in the House of Representatives? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further question I pose is: What would happen in a by-<span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1902 in Tasmania there was a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would not have been too much of a problem in 1902 but let us consider what it would be like today if there were a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales and it were held at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about reforming the system of <span class="highlight">election</span> to this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any system similar to the one which operated in New South Wales at the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, when a ballot was held on 13 December and we got a result on 6 February, I believe needs an overhaul. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In New South Wales in 1974 we had 73 candidates for the Senate elections and in 1975, 53 candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course this leads to an <span class="highlight">election</span> lottery system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we ought to be considering in the Senate is the setting up of a committee like the Houghton committee in Britain which recommended government funding for <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise these questions because I feel that the present system of <span class="highlight">election</span> to this chamber has become so complicated that it is not understood by the vast majority of voters and for the reasons I have stated it has become something of a lottery, especially in a close contest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this not only does the system come into disrepute but also when we have the sort of <span class="highlight">election</span> that we had in New South Wales in 1 974 and 1975 I believe that the reputation of this Senate suffers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps we are erring on the cautious side but the law officers to the Government have advised that, whilst we may get away with it, should a redistribution take place and an <span class="highlight">election</span> be held and we did not really take this extra step, such action could be subject to a challenge which might succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested to hear  Senator Mulvihill  say that New South Wales always has a redistribution just before an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not know whether the High Court will one of these days define what it meant when it said ‘a general <span class="highlight">election</span> held at or towards the effluxion of the 3 years spoken of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that that is what the High Court had in mind, that it would be about the time an <span class="highlight">election</span> normally would be due within the expectations of a parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far back it relates in terms of a snap or early <span class="highlight">election</span> will have to be determined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A constitutional amendment in relation to simultaneous elections will ensure that elections for the 2 Houses are brought together, and we can have at such elections a full national debate on issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Half the Senate will go out with the House of Representatives at each <span class="highlight">election</span> every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The further period of government without an <span class="highlight">election</span> which comes as an optional extra from this referendum will be an additional help to the improvement in the economy which we can expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise, if we wanted to bring the elections for both Houses together we would have to have a premature poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future we will have contemporaneous polls for both the Senate and the House of Representatives not, as in the past on many occasions a separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and then a separate <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives, with people saying that the Senate was not contemporaneous, that it was out of date, that its senators did not represent the opinion of the people now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns have not been debates on Senate issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is claimed at such polls that people can vote against a government in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and the result will not destroy the government; that it will show the displeasure of the community if people vote for an independent or some small party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh, you know that in an ordinary <span class="highlight">election</span> candidates are not elected on the basis of one issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held well ahead of the mandatory date their term will not expire until 1 July or 30 June of the next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have during that period another poll and concentration must be directed towards the necessity of winning a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, I do not think that makes for a good government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee concluded, in paragraph 243 above, that an increased number of Senate elections has been avoided by obtaining the dissolution of the House of Representatives before the expiration of its normal life of three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A premature <span class="highlight">election</span> brought about by the need to synchronise general elections with elections for senators makes it difficult to obtain constructive government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If separate elections for senators are held, work of the Parliament is completely disrupted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the House of Representatives, as well as senators, must devote their energies  to the task of  obtaining the best possible results for their respective parties at the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has faced separate elections before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has faced joint elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it has grown to a zenith of power in recent years not because of separate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators may recall that the last 2 elections- the one in 1974 and the one in 1975- were not separate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet in 1974 there was left in the Senate after the <span class="highlight">election</span> a majority hostile to the then government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that in any way the Senate’s real significance to this country is dependent upon the fortuitous fact that there have been some separate elections in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe in the arguments which we have heard, which we will hear and which I have heard around the Senate already that somehow a government, under this constitutional proposal, will rush to another <span class="highlight">election</span> immediately after an <span class="highlight">election</span> in order to bring out a hostile Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this country, the people are concerned about premature elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are not very pleased at being called to vote at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any government that came into power and then sought to hold a quick <span class="highlight">election</span> again to get rid of the other half of the Senate would risk all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770223_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the only suggestion that he had for synchronising the elections was to use the cumbersome procedure of section 57 which as he well knows is not available and has not been available for most of the life of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is only rarely that there has been the sort of disagreement between the 2 Houses which enables a Prime Minister to go along and ask the Governor-General to dissolve the Houses and to have a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the GovernorGeneral is on record, in a speech he made in India when he was on a visit there, as saying that he would not necessarily grant an early <span class="highlight">election</span> to a Prime Minister merely because the Prime Minister wanted it and it suited him politically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we advocated synchronisation of elections for both Houses it was necessary and it is still necessary for the reasons I shall give. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he has any elementary honesty he would have to admit that it is not for any reasons which might have to do with political principle but merely because of the blue funk which his Government is now in about facing the electors of Australia either for a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> or for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because his Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  fears that if the Government cannot keep the Senate going longer than it was originally intended to be in being, if it has to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time as early as May or June 1978, it will get a resounding rejection from the electorate, compounded by the fact, as  Senator Missen  pointed out, that a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> partakes of the atmosphere of a by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Withers and Malcolm Fraser know that if there were a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> early next year the Government’s numbers in the Senate would be reduced and it would go out to the world what is now clear from the gallop polls, that there is creeping dissatisfaction throughout all sections of the community with this Government which has failed so abjectly to fulfil the promises with which it stole office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also believe that Parliament should express the will of the people as expressed at the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> and that this purpose is best served by simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also believe that simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses will save busy Ministers and members of Parliament from wasted time in constant electioneering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it incredible that the present Government should introduce this Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill which radically weakens and undermines the powers of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it completely beyond belief when that decision comes so soon after the Senate, in what I think was the most worthy exercise of its powers, used the express reserve power of rejection to give the people an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it incredible that this Bill should be called a Bill for simultaneous elections when it is nothing of the sort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, I suggest that it provides for a half dissolution of the Senate every time there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British electoral system allows the Prime Minister to call for the dissolution of Parliament and the holding of a general <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time he pleases within the 5 years that is the statutory limit of each Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went on to say that, if no decision of the Senate has precipitated the <span class="highlight">election</span>, then half of the Senate should go if the Senate decides for convenience or cost that there should be a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that its decision to bring on a dissolution of the House of Representatives means that we would automatically go to the country, whatever be the cause of that <span class="highlight">election</span>, reduces this House to a mere echo of the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of most importance was the assertion of the supremacy of Parliament over the Executive Government, demonstrated by the exercise of the power of the Senate to withhold Supply and the dismissal of a Prime Minister who refused to advise an <span class="highlight">election</span> or resign when denied Supply by Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore stood for <span class="highlight">election</span> and was successful in gaining membership of this body which I then thought was an august body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill were again presented to the Senate and this House was not prepared to accept the expression of opinion by the people at that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 think it is a desirable and logical principle to have joint elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cannot have a censure against his Government this year or next year as a result of a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the elections for the 2 Houses are brought together, as is stated here, we will get the same complexion, the same political affiliation reflected in the people ‘s view at the time they have to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What concerns me about the proposals to hold referenda in the manner which is being sought is that it is evident that the Fraser Government considers that it will be unable to restrain inflation and to reduce unemployment by the time of the expected half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in mid- 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously that is what is behind the proposals which are being put before the Senate and, in particular, the proposal for the so called simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be given the chance to show and in fact will be tested on their genuineness about simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not an argument about simultaneous elections at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could not care less whether we have simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen  last night suggested that not having simultaneous elections throws up all sorts of odd people into this chamber, including independents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was elected at a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> and received almost twice the quota; so I do not mind in the slightest having simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, senators will be given an opportunity at a later time to test their genuineness about whether they want simultaneous elections or whether they feel that what  Senator Button  and  Senator Cavanagh  said is true, that is, that the net result of carrying this referendum in the electorate would be the emasculation of the powers of the Senate and the significant transfer of powers from the States to the central Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the immutable principles which he stood on at that time somehow changed or has he changed in some desperate move to stave off a Gallup poll <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1978 which would allow the people to make a judgment on his performance as Prime Minister and the performance of the Government without invoking the ultimate sanction of throwing the Government out of office? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants simultaneous elections it can have simultaneous elections and can have them by calling an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives in the middle part of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it wanted to, the Government could synchronise elections by having an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the middle part of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Malcolm  Mackerras apparently has guessed -some of his guesses have gone wrong on previous occasions- that if the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is held in 1978 the Government could stand a chance of losing the numbers in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That will leave remaining in the Senate16 Government senators, 12 Labor Party senators and one independent Given that all States go against the Government except Queensland, the result of the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1978 would be a return of 16 Government senators and 19 Opposition senators, giving the following line-up after the half Senate elections in 1978: 32 Government senators, 31 Opposition senators and one independent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test of this matter is whether the Government is prepared to put the proposals to a referendum at the same time as the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not want to go to the people on the vital issues that are affecting the economy- prices and incomes- but it will spend their money and create more inflation by going to the people separately with referenda proposals on these matters for purely political purposes, namely, to avoid the opinion of the people as it would be declared at a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why not allow this matter to be decided at an <span class="highlight">election</span> time, as I think the Whitlam Government did? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least that Government held the referendum at the same time as an <span class="highlight">election</span> for this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Somebody will correct me if I am wrong; but, from memory, that referendum was held at the same time as an <span class="highlight">election</span> for this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning, the real issue is this: The Government admits by the introduction of this legislation that it cannot get the economy going again by the expected time of the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are being asked to write into the Constitution a power which would, in future, prevent any kind of mid-term elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would prevent a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> being held between elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He thinks that the people of Australia are going to give him a kick in the pants at the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To say that the people are annoyed and irritated with elections is really to argue for a dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us throw aside this idea that cost or the irritation involved in an <span class="highlight">election</span> is the thing to be considered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have quoted from the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1974 as set out at pages 253 to 277 of the Senate  Hansard  of 13 March 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is going ahead only with these particular matters let it save money by submitting them at the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason that Opposition senators gave for holding the referendum in conjunction with the general <span class="highlight">election</span> was to save on costs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would enable the Government to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the final dying hours of 1 978 or in April or May of 1979, to bring down a horror Budget this year, to allow unemployment and inflation to run rampant throughout the country and to impose upon the ordinary people of Australia the heavy burden of shouldering those problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But why do they not say that it should be held at the time of the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The leadership of the parliamentary Labor Party will come up again in May of this year because of the principle of an 18- months review of leadership which was adopted by Caucus after the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the referenda proposals go through and if there is to be a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> in about November or December 1978, who is going to challenge his leadership one month before an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course no one will challenge his leadership one month before an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be unimportant to some that the government of the country is interrupted every 18 months or so by a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> with all the campaigning that goes on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governments which have hanging over them the threat of a hostile upper House which may throw them out at any time or which must go to elections to maintain their majority in the upper House every 18 months will be reluctant, I submit, to take some of the difficult and politically unpopular decisions that they should make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support this legislation to amend the Constitution, so that if it is passed by the people, we will have simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and for the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless in such a case we would have removed the sorry situation that we have at the moment and that we have experienced in recent years whereby we have elections for the House of Representatives and later on .have an <span class="highlight">election</span> of half the members of the Senate, with a continuation of that pattern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, when we consider the fact that certain people put up a ‘no’ case against the referendum that we had in 1974- and were so insistent that there should be a ‘no’ case- and subsequently there was a ‘no’ vote in respect of this simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> proposal, and then find now that they are advocating a ‘yes’ case, we might wonder at their motives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the booklet which was sent to every elector at that time there were comments about the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1 974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Constitution, the law and Parliamentary practice allows each Prime Minister to have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> on the same day as any Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why is  Mr Fraser  now saying’ that we should have a referendum to alter the Constitution, following the will of the people, so that we will have simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister wants simultaneous elections all he has to do is take out the House of Representatives with the Senate sometime in the next financial year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fraser  does not want any type of <span class="highlight">election</span> before the end of 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we were to have a single Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> it would have to be held as late as the last Saturday in June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would it, in fact, hold a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the same time, that is in May 1978, or would it wait and have the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> some 6 months after the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last thing the Government wants is a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> prior to the end of June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It knows that if it had a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> simultaneously then it would be not only defeated, it would be slaughtered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were genuine about its proposals to bring elections for the 2 Houses together it could propose a date not in May but some time after 1 July this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would provide the opportunity for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, initially, it is not up the Commonwealth Government or the GovernorGeneral to call a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this referendum proposal were put down not for May but for some time in July or after that it would allow some of the States at least to call a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government decided that the vote on the referenda proposals had to be held in May because, at that stage, there would be no possibility that the Government would have to face the will of the people at a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I look forward to the proposal being passed by the people so that the Constitution can be altered and so that we can have the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> on the same date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I am displeased at the motives which suggested to the Government that it should not only bring this Bill before the Parliament but should do so now so that it will not have to face a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> later this year or in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to 1 96 1 there was not much need to think about the necessity for the elections for the 2 Houses to be in line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those people who looked at it must have been fairly far seeing, even those who had a dissenting view, because after that review it was revealed what a cumbersome situation could prevail when the elections for the 2 Houses became out of line. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However prior to 1961 only one Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> had been held by itself and not in conjunction with a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1929 and 1954 House of Representatives elections were held by themselves and not in conjunction with a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However 1953 was the only time when a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> had been held not in conjunction with a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> up to 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 we had a Senate and a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> but following that an early <span class="highlight">election</span> was called for the House of Representatives in 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So in 1964 there was a necessity for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we had a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> by itself and the pattern continued. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1966 there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1967 there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1970 there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1972 there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each <span class="highlight">election</span> was for one House only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in the electorate were becoming heartily tired of <span class="highlight">election</span> after <span class="highlight">election</span> because not only did they have to elect people for the House of Representatives and the Senate but also they had to elect their State representatives and their local government representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them found that there was just one long run of elections, and the pattern would have continued if it had not been for the double dissolutions in 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had not had the double dissolution in 1975 the pattern would have continued after the 1974 double dissolution because the senators’ terms would have been backdated and there would not have been the necessity to hold a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the same time as a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the case again where the two will be out of line unless something is done because the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> must be held by the last Saturday in June 1978 or, more correctly according to the Constitution, on the last day of June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 mention Saturday because that is the day on which the Electoral Act says we shall have our elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was mentioned earlier that if we had fewer elections the cost would be much less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an important consideration not only for the major parties who contest the elections but also for the people, who, through taxation, have to fund the elections each time they are held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cost of holding a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in conjunction with a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> will be much less than if they were held at different times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too many elections are not good for government whichever government might be in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wants to bring the 2 elections into line so that he does not need to have a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1978 and can continue with his unpopular policies for longer than he normally would have been able to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> Bill is designed to weaken the power of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They upheld the action of the Senate in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of December 1975 because they realised that the government had to be changed <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever merit there may be in reducing the power of the Senate- and in my view it is substantial- the only power which this Bill and this referendum seek to take from the Senate is the power to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the House of Representatives without any members of the Senate having to present themselves to the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under post-November 1975 practice or perhaps even law, the Senate can force the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> every 6 months by stalling- not even by rejecting- Supply or Appropriation Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is simply not true to assert, as most of the people opposing this Bill have asserted, that simultaneous elections can be secured without carrying the referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simultaneous elections can be guaranteed only if the Bill and the subsequent referendum are carried. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I presume that because the Liberal Party and the National Country Party were successful in the <span class="highlight">election</span> which ensued,  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack is claiming on very tenuous logical grounds that the people thereby endorsed the actions of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although it is no longer possible to test directly whether the people supported the Senate’s action at that time, putting forward this Bill does provide some opportunity to test, albeit indirectly but more directly than the test of a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, whether the people do support the action which the Senate took at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth is that it is the only way to guarantee that Senate and House of Representatives elections will be held simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may have been some argument in 1974 as to whether it was the only way; there can be no argument now because the doctrine has been proclaimed and apparently accepted, that the Senate can withhold Supply and force an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the House of Representatives without any part of the Senate having to present itself to the electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately for  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack and for all his colleagues, their present Leader,  Senator Withers,  was indiscreet enough on 9 April 1974 to put into  Hansard  the real reasons why the Liberal and National Country Party senators- every one of them- forced the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eighteen months ago we embarked on a course to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there should be simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the public wants the elections for the 2 Houses of Parliament to come together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could then remain in the Senate without having to face an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could have done that in 1974 but on that occasion a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not agree with the former Prime Minister  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  on most things but on that occasion I thought he had something when he said that people who had been elected in 1967 and in 1970 were able to make a decision to send the people who were elected in 1972 to 2 elections without going to an <span class="highlight">election</span> themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far there have been 12 or more speakers in the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing constitutional provisions it is possible theoretically for elections for both Houses of Parliament to be synchronised by holding elections for the House of Representatives whenever half Senate elections are due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, elections for both Houses have been out of phase since 1963 when, as has been said, for reasons of political expediency, to obtain a short term political advantage the Menzies Government called an early House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result has been that, in the 9-year period from 1963 to 1972, 7 national elections have been held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Constitution is not altered and the status quo continues, there can be as many as 4 elections over the next 4 years and that would mean that 14 elections all told would have been held between 1961 and 1981. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of this, the Bill aims at altering the Constitution by an amendment to ensure that the elections for both Houses are brought together. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was pointed out last evening by  Senator Missen  in relation to the situation that arises when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held in late November or early December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following such an <span class="highlight">election</span>, some senators may unfortunately lose their seats but they continue to sit in this Senate until 1 July of the following year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political reality is that by bringing elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate back into phase this Government can hold off a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> until, at the latest, March 1 979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is almost certain that, if a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> were held in the middle of next year, the Government would lose 3 Senate seats in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party would certainly hold the 3 Labor seats which would be up for <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opposing cases, as I see it, are that on one hand this Bill is being presented as a convenient adjustment of the mechanics of the <span class="highlight">election</span> provisions of the Constitution; on the other, it is being opposed in my case on the grounds that enactment of this legislation would result in a substantial and radical change in the nature of the Senate and in the distribution of political power in Australia in a way which I believe would be to the long term detriment of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the ultimate, the proposal can enable simultaneous elections but does not, as suggested, ensure them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again remind the Senate that in 1961 the Menzies Government went to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which it all but lost and which many people would say it richly deserved to lose- one of the reasons being that its policies had had a very detrimental effect in the State of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Menzies’  advisers had told him at that time that the situation in Queensland had improved and that if he wanted to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> to increase his majority he might well consider calling an early <span class="highlight">election</span> because he could increase that majority in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was persuaded on that occasion by his advisers in Queensland, in contrast with the earlier occasion, and we had an early <span class="highlight">election</span> which put the Senate and the House of Representatives out of step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the source of the subsequent difficulty in House of Representatives and Senate elections being out of step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To give the Prime Minister the power to take the Senate to an <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time would be a divisive and intimidatory tool in the hands of whatever man or woman might hold that office in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people have suggested that if the Senate has a very particular power over the House of Represenatives to send it to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which it obviously does have at the present time, that it is only right that the House of Representatives ought also to have that power over the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is suggested that we are afraid of being taken to <span class="highlight">election</span> by the Prime Minister and facing the verdict of the voters because that will lessen our degree of independence, will make us toe the line, and will ensure that the government of the time has an easier passage than many governments in the past have had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Prime Minister has a power to take the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elections do many things, but one thing they do supremely within a political party is enforce party discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It comes through the possibility of losing one’s seat at an <span class="highlight">election</span>- as long as there is no <span class="highlight">election</span> one has an infinitely better chance of keeping one’s seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held for the Senate simultaneously with an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives it may be that the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> would indicate a slide if there were a slide one way or the other in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Separate elections for the Senate have been supported. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people could well take a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> as one that does not really matter all that much, that will not be significant in the immediate future government of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simultaneous elections that occurred in 1974 and 1975 seem to lend emphasis to that view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that in 1974 the Australian people returned the Whitlam Government in the House of Representatives and in a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> for the whole of the Senate they failed to give  Mr Whitlam  control of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that was not only evidence of the intelligence of the Australian electorate but also justification of the view that one <span class="highlight">election</span> for one House will not necessarily be a mirror image of an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the other House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not one who assumes or in any way would believe that the electors would have a bar of frivolous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If any honourable senator can imagine an <span class="highlight">election</span> called by the House of Representatives involving half the Senate and then 6 or 9 months later the calling of another <span class="highlight">election</span> being acceptable to the Australian electorate his imagination goes further afield than mine and I trust that his imagination is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the majority after that <span class="highlight">election</span> had not been sufficient to give  Mr Whitlam  a majority in the Senate, if after that <span class="highlight">election</span> the majority still had not been with the Labor Party, during the early part of 1973, in that euphoric stage through which we passed when he was handing out all the goodies, when the damage was not obvious to the people and when he had not shown his true socialist colours, he could have again taken the House of Representatives to the people and under this legislation, the second half of the Senate automatically would have gone to an <span class="highlight">election</span> with  Mr Whitlam  and the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be surprised,  Senator, if  you could go round Tasmania and convince people in the trade union movement- you did pretty well in the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions- that the trade union movement can look to its elected representatives to get unfettered progress of industrial legislation and at the present time fight an interim Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> where a lot of what we want can be vetoed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I spoke to a host of people after the last general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some did not even vote in that <span class="highlight">election</span> as a matter of protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He says: ‘Look, let them have their elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let them have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> but we will apply the power of veto in the Senate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Constitution; the law and parliamentary practice allows each Prime Minister to have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> on the same day as any Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He can have the House of Representatives and Senate elections on the same day simply by his own decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Kathy  Martin today pointed out how the elections came to be out of kilter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, as  Senator Kathy  Martin said, when he thought that the sun was shining a little more brightly he rushed us out to another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a ‘staggered’ <span class="highlight">election</span> system with half of the Senate coming up for <span class="highlight">election</span> every 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned that there should be no derogation of the power that a senator exercises as a result of his <span class="highlight">election</span> for a term of 6 years, and that is where it comes in in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They set out in detail an analysis made by that learned gentleman of the way in which a senator’s rights and responsibilities are exercised, in part, through his <span class="highlight">election</span> for a term of 6 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 6-year term gives a senator a measure of independence which a relationship between his term of office and a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> would deny him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conceivably, a government could go back to the people time and time again forcing <span class="highlight">election</span> after <span class="highlight">election</span>, until it won control of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we ought to be considering some measure under which we can govern the interval between simultaneous elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say quite frankly that I am not opposed to the principle of simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am concerned about the frequency of elections if that power is in the hands of an irresponsible Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the best answer to this matter would be to adopt a provision similar to that which prevails in South Australia There the Constitution Act provides that the Upper House, the Legislative Council, is guaranteed a full term of 6 years and that the Premier in that State cannot take the Upper House out at an <span class="highlight">election</span> at intervals of less than 3 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to move at the Committee stage of this debate to limit the interval between elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that had a provision for simultaneous elections been in the Constitution in 1972 we would have had an extra <span class="highlight">election</span>, not one less. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would have had  Mr Whitlam  attempting to win control of the Senate by having another <span class="highlight">election</span> early in 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One year there is a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, another year there is a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in between there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> for possibly both Houses of a State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one examines that, why should there not be those elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reflects upon why those elections are held, why ought not the justification to be readily expressed and readily accepted and why ought we not to say that this is the means by which we govern ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If its purpose is to arrange simultaneous elections between the House of Representatives and the Senate the answer is no. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  could easily decide that and he could choose, if he needed to, to arrange a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> at the same time as the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> instead of spending S megabucks or $Sm, as honourable senators would know it, on having the referendum particularly when it must be rememberedthis is something that not many people have mentioned- that the founding fathers referred to the desirability of holding separate elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister, as I have indicated, has used the argument that there are too many elections as the sole justification for his proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He believes that we should bring into line the elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He postulates as a sound principle that every 3 years there should be a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> and that at the same time- at the same <span class="highlight">election</span>- there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for that half of the Senate for which an <span class="highlight">election</span> is required at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its other equally important role is to review, to consider and often to suggest improvements to legislation sometimes sent to the Council hastily by the Assembly in answer to some spectacular <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge … or sent to it as a result of the advocacy of some dominant member of the ministry whose pet theme is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a ‘staggered’ <span class="highlight">election</span> system with half of the Senate coming up for <span class="highlight">election</span> every three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> were to be held at the normal time I believe it would have been at the moment of the Government’s greatest unpopularity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is common knowledge that Senate elections such as have been held since the early 1960s in Australia are held in a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> atmosphere, and in that situation they do not genuinely reflect the wish of the people as to who should govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time of his report he was able to say- good luck to him- that only on one occasion in 59 years, in 1953, has it been necessary to have a separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He held those views in the light of a system which had produced only one separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in 59 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that suddenly the concept of bringing the elections together will destroy this chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Senate was not destroyed up to 1959- the time of the writing of that report- it will not be destroyed after the passage of this referendum and the guaranteeing of simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will do anything to push back the holding of the next <span class="highlight">election</span> for either the Senate or the House of Representatives as far as it possibly can because it knows that if it meets the judgment of the people, either in a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> next year or in any other form of <span class="highlight">election</span>, that will be curtains for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The principles involved and the philosophy of what simultaneous elections mean to the Australian people have all been thrown overboard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is not being said that the mere fact that there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> of half the Senate and the House of Representatives at the same time will weaken the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is being conceded also that if the Senate takes some action which would precipitate an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives, or which may cause a political issue to arise on which the Prime Minister may recommend that the House of Representatives go to the people, or if the Senate is an initiating force in some way of a political crisis which leads to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, it would be reasonable in those circumstances for half the Senate to go to the people with the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> as such does not weaken the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, she implied that the Prime Minister could have an early <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives and thereby take out the other half of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would be a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it suggested that suddenly the new Prime Minister, having just been elected after some period in Opposition, having just formed his Government, with all the enthusiasm that a new government would have and with all the hopes that it would have, is going to turn round within a very short time and call another general <span class="highlight">election</span> and thus put the government at risk? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have just been elected with a thumping majority and I want another <span class="highlight">election</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think that even  Senator James  McClelland would object if the GovernorGeneral refused an <span class="highlight">election</span> in such circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only the action taken by the Opposition in April 1974 which made him go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also refer him to the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of December 1975 that a Liberal government would reduce the level of unemployment by 200 000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the fact that the Indonesian Government has decided to have a general <span class="highlight">election</span> in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the Indonesian Government’s decision, what action will be taken to recall all Australian personnel working on aid programs outside city areas whose time will  Become  completely unproductive until after the elections are held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament would have power just to make laws for the times of Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, ensuring that those elections were held at the same time as House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the effect of the amendment would be that when a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was held for half the Senate, an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives would be held at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the House of Representatives elections would be tied to Senate elections, rather than Senate elections being tied to House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly if those fixed terms remain in the Constitution, the only way to give effect to this amendment would be for a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held every 3 years at the same time as an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators have been talking about profound changes and so on being made to the Constitution by this Bill but if House of Representatives elections must be held at the same time as Senate elections, that is, virtually at fixed times, then we are facing a fundamental change in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore any tying of elections for the House of Representatives with fixed terms with Senate elections, which is the effect of  Senator Wright’s  amendment, would be a fundamental change in the Constitution and it is not one which this Government certainly is proposing or would propose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one can conceive a crazy situation in which it was decided to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>House of Representatives one week and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate a week or so later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is so inconceivable that the amendment becomes unnecessary and that in fact the substance of the amendment put forward by the Government in this amending Bill is simultanous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the whole purpose of it is to bring elections for both Houses into line as was the practice years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although this leaves with the Paliament the right to make laws in respect of the date and timing of the elections it is obvious that no Parliament in its right senses would contemplate having anything like a weeks difference or something like that in the holding of the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Eric  moved an amendment to the effect that the writs for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> should be issued by the Governor of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to say- I shall not repeat this in proposing the amendment- that the Bill claims to be aBill to ensure simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that this is a Bill to ensure that half the Senate shall be dissolved every time there is a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been made quite clear that the person who decides within the constitutional period of 3 years when a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> shall occur is the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is that undermining of the power of the Senate that we find so difficult to reconcile with a true description of this Bill, which is described as one merely to ensure simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It incorporates what I believe the majority of honourable senators want, that is, presumably, simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned, from a political point of view I do not mind simultaneous elections because 1 was returned with 2 quotas at a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes it is important to have a half senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, not in conjunction with an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Government, where the people can express their opinion about the performance of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government supporters are absolutely terrified of going to the people in a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in mid 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understood  Senator Wright  to say that he was not happy with the present system where the Prime Minister has the right to call an <span class="highlight">election</span> when he thinks fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All they have to do is refuse to pass Supply every time it comes into this chamber and then they can force the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> while they sit pat in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This chamber should have to go to the people every time it forces the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose is to preserve the power of the Senate to force the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> every time there is a Labor Government in that place and it docs not have the numbers in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, after deliberating for 3 months the other place, the House of Representatives, considers the proposal important enough, it can submit it again to the Senate and if the Senate, by its own action, thinks that the rejection of the measure is so important and rejects it again, it knows full well that it is only just then to argue the issue before the country and have a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> upon the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, after the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Senate comes back upheld in its stand upon an equal vote in each State with equality of numbers in this chamber, but if Sydney and Melbourne, with their 79 votes out of 125, prevail in the House of Representatives, the Representatives view can be established only if there is a majority in a joint sitting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made it crystal clear that he did not consider that the mere wish or request of a Prime Minister was sufficient to oblige him to grant an <span class="highlight">election</span> merely because it suited the convenience of the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Wright  is concerned with the learned writings from which he has quoted and if he is so devoted to the statistics which he has given us in support of the proposition that a Prime Minister can have an <span class="highlight">election</span> any time he wants to, I can supply the honourable senator with a copy of this speech by  Sir John  Kerr. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should put at rest any notion which  Senator Wright  has that even a  Sir John  Kerr will grant a Malcolm Fraser an <span class="highlight">election</span> any time he wants one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only because the twelfth Parliament was dissolved 2 years later that the next <span class="highlight">election</span> for senators was able to be held simultaneously with the <span class="highlight">election</span> for members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to comment on the matters raised in the recent debate by saying that, if one looks at some examples of what might possibly occur, bearing in mind what has happened in Australian politics in the past, and at the sorts of things which might precipitate a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, one would have to agree that to have this absolute provision in the Constitution is undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that situation, for example, if a government fell because it had simply lost its majority in the House of Representatives and the Parliament had to be dissolved, it seems to be axiomatic that there ought also to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Senate so that the voters would have an opportunity to have the representation in this chamber reflect the new political alignments which had occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask them to explain how, if, the amendment proposing the addition of words to the proposed new section 13 ( 1 ) is agreed to and if a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives were to be held, say within 12 months of the original <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives, but because of the amendment  Senator Wright  proposes no Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> was held simultaneously with that House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>, what provision or provisions would determine the term of a senator or the date of the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I summarise them again: They include the convenience and practicality of not having elections for half the Senate separate from the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives so that a situation arises in which there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the national Parliament roughly every 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a situation which occurred between 1963 and 1972 when no less than 7 elections for the national Parliament or some part of it were held in a period of 9 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of situation that develops when elections for the House of Representatives and half the Senate get out of kilter as occurred in 1963. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speakers in the debate last night did not deny the desirability of having simultaneous elections and everybody’s preference for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This idea that there must be 7 elections in the next 9 years is completely false. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All members of the Liberal Party of Australia, including  Senator Durack,  said to a man 2 years ago that this alteration to the Constitution was unnecessary to achieve simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It only requires the House of Representatives to have a premature dissolution to synchronise its elections with the Senate at a time stipulated by the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is completely misleading to put that forward as necessitating an undue number of elections in the next 9 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a question as to whether the Governor-General had power to ask for a new Prime Minister who would recommend a dissolution so as to enable an <span class="highlight">election</span> to take place to avoid mal-administration and to ensure that the Government could get parliamentary funds to carry on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for the Prime Minister, who is the elected nominee of the majority from Sydney and Melbourne, to advise the Governor-General that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is required and to send half this Senate to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that because of flood or fire an <span class="highlight">election</span> is postponed from one Saturday to the next. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> is not something that just happens on a particular day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But broadly speaking and as a practical matter this Bill together with the supplementary legislation that is contemplated will achieve simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I briefly reply to the suggestion by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs  (Senator Durack)  that this legislation is necessary to achieve simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That seems to remain the basis upon which it is put-that the Bill is necessary to achieve simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malcolm Fraser, in an <span class="highlight">election</span> statement said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators for a State following a dissolution of the Senate but before the division of the senators for that State into classes in pursuance of this section, the place of a senator chosen at that <span class="highlight">election</span> has become vacant, the division of senators shall be made as if the place of that senator had not so become vacant and, for the purposes of section fifteen of this Constitution, the term of service of that senator shall be deemed to be, and to have been, the period for which he would have held his place, in accordance with this section, if his place had not so become vacant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment has the same effect except that it provides a guaranteed term of 18 months after a conjoint <span class="highlight">election</span> between the House of Representatives and the Senate, whether it be a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> or a double dissolution, whereas  Senator Wright’s  amendment guaranteed 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, the objection is that the acceptance of this amendment, as with  Senator Wright’s  amendment, would mean that in some circumstances the 2 Houses would get out of kilter and simultaneous elections would not be able to be ensured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Whilst I can see and have at all times accepted the argument in favour of the convenience and the reduction in cost of holding simultaneous elections, that makes simultaneous elections desirable but not essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I, therefore, ask again that people reconsider the instances where they are prepared to say that elections must be held simultaneously or the instances where they are prepared to take a stand and make simultaneous elections as practicable as they can without making simultaneous elections absolutely essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is: Should a Prime Ministerany Prime Minister, of whatever party- the chief of the executive government, be able to take half of the Senate to an <span class="highlight">election</span> at his whim and at any time that he choses, as opposed to at any time that the actions of that chamber have lead to a deadlock or confrontation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said that I did not see any advantage in having a second House- in retaining a bicameral system and having the Senate- if the decision of when one half of the membership of that House is to be put to an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be made at the whim of the chief of the executive government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My short answer to  Senator James  McClelland s point is that the Senate cannot in any way nominate the day on which the House of Representatives will go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Entirely at their whim- as early as they like or after a matter of months- they can nominate a day for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister of the day can take half this House to the country at any time he thinks is politically opportune, any study of the structure would convince any objective student that that makes this House a rubber stamp of the executive government unless the people at a joint <span class="highlight">election</span> divine the situation so as to return to this chamber sufficient numbers who will stand against the executive government when reelected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens if the Senate is taken to the people a short time after <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a very reasonable conclusion to say that that probably is an infringement and a restriction which would be imposed upon the opportunity to have double dissolutions under section 57 which bring senators to an <span class="highlight">election</span> before their time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would make the concession to the Government that one refusal to pass a proposed law already passed by the House of Representatives would give the House of Representatives the right to call a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another proposes a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> if the Senate rejects any money Bill in the sense that I have indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this amendment is to enable the government of the day, if it has had a measure rejected in the Senate which has been passed by the House of Representatives, to operate this Bill and have a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the same time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect  Senator Wright  said that it is perfectly reasonable that the Senate at any time of its choosing should be able to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the House of Representatives and have half the Senate go to the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is perfectly reasonable that the Senate should be able to precipitate an <span class="highlight">election</span>, surely it is perfectly reasonable that the entire Senate face the electors and be judged on its actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However the amendment does not ensure simultaneous elections occur at all times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a situation where it is necessary for half the Senate to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> and there is not a rejection or failure to pass any proposed law submitted to the Senate by the House of Representatives of course according to  Senator Wright’s  amendment there would not be a situation in which simultaneous elections would be possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come back to the point I have been making over and over again: This Bill is designed to ensure that there will be simultaneous elections to avoid the excessive number of elections that have been occurring over the last 10 years or so in the national Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is not all about whether the 2 Houses ought to come together for <span class="highlight">election</span> on polling day; it is much deeper than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should they not have the opportunity to say: Perhaps there is some merit in the proposal, but why should not the referendum be held simultaneously with the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and thus save a great deal of money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of this convention now, if the people approve, to be turned into law is that the proportional representation system of <span class="highlight">election</span> must be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second part of the amendment, which is likewise most valuable and originates from the Constitutional Convention last year, is the provision that the person appointed to fill a vacancy shall not just fill it until the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, when he may be thrown out and proportional representation would no longer apply in the State he represented, he will in fact now serve the balance of the term of the person who was elected originally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, I ran on a group at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in order to get into the groupings under the provisions of the Electoral Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Proportional representation was introduced in 1949 in the <span class="highlight">election</span> for representatives of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Alf Arnell was the next candidate on the Labor Senate ticket at that <span class="highlight">election</span> and he was nominated by the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, well knew at that time that I had been endorsed already as the candidate of the ALP for the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation goes a long way towards ensuring that the Senate retains the proportional representation that was given to it by the electors at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proper way to give representation to a successor of a vacant seat under proportional representation is to recount the votes because the votes at a single <span class="highlight">election</span> must be represented in the proportion in which the people then voted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An empirical decision subsequent to an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the fulfilment of a vacancy, unless guided by the recount of votes of a candidate who has already been before the people, will be invading the very fundamental principles of proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770225_senate_30_s71/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that he did not secure re-endorsement for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1974 in circumstances which, I think it might be fair to say, a lesser person could have well taken amiss, he remained a loyal and dedicated supporter of the Australian Labor Party until his death shortly after the death of his wife to whom he was very close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But so strong are the links which bind us and so great are the tangible and intangible benefits which our allegiance has produced over so many years that I am confident that any such proposal will be rejected by a majority more overwhelming than that which swept us into government at the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the way it came to power I pointed out that if the Government’s policies which it had enunciated during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign were not realised, if it did not bring down inflation and unemployment, it would be shown no quarter in the criticism which we would direct towards it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were prepared to bring on, or to threaten to bring on, an <span class="highlight">election</span> every 6 months to the detriment of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian people will become more disillusioned as time goes by, and no doubt disillusionment has already been expressed in some State elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that when the result of the next <span class="highlight">election</span> is known we will see a change back to policies which recognise the needs of the Australian people and which seek to give equity and genuine assistance to those in the Australian community who really need it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me cite to the Parliament some of the statements that were made at that time in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech by  Mr Fraser,  who, as a result of that <span class="highlight">election</span>, became the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a period of some 15 months or 16 months in office the business confidence about which we heard so much from this Government and its supporters during that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and about which we have heard so much from them in this Parliament since that campaign has not come to fruition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within a week or fortnight of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the new Wran Labor Government the Federal Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  and the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, were blaming the Wran Labor Government for the high incidence of unemployment in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again cite  Mr Fraser  ‘s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech of November 1975 on which he was given a mandate in both Houses to govern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is a great deal of cynicism exists in Australia today because of the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech of the Prime Minister and of recurring statements made by the Prime Minister and his Ministers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party said: We are now enlightened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government took the Australian people for a ride in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975 and carried the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in fact, on 26 November 1975 the Prime Minister said that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal-National Country Party government would give such business confidence that there would be a drop of some 200 000 in unemployment in its first 6 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man, the Prime Minister, has abandoned almost every promise he made during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to the community in general, particularly those promises made to the poor and underprivileged in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has even abandoned promises he made after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has been successful in stopping this atrocity, in stopping the Government going back on legislation which it introduced only 4 months ago, in stopping the Government going back completely on one of the firmest promises it made in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not to say that that is a denial of the promise that was made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and subsequently that tax reform remains a basic objective of the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that is an improvement on the promise made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that tax indexation would be introduced over a 3-year period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore hope that these are some of the matters that will be considered by the Federal Government during this Parliamentary session and during the period of its office which, of course, will continue beyond the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770309_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the high level of unemployment, the record December consumer price index increase of 6 per cent and now the record deficit which, when all taken together, constitute economic mismanagement of the worst degree, will the Government now take the advice it so often gave in opposition, that is, to have an immediate <span class="highlight">election</span> to allow the Australian electorate to make a judgment of its performance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has indicated, both in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policies and subsequently in its Budget decisions, that it supports student allowance schemes of the nature of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and others, and that, unlike the Opposition, it supports those schemes with a realisation of the need for the allowances to be increased in view of increases in the cost of living in times of inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not living up to its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been criticism of the Government over its failure to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise regarding inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The complete lack of honesty and the complete incompetence of the Fraser Government should lead to an <span class="highlight">election</span> now if  Mr Fraser  really meant what he said in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770310_senate_30_s72/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, on one nomination form I know of which he submitted as a candidate for Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> he showed his occupation as that of barman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember his disappointment when he lost his Senate preselection after, as  Senator Mulvihill  just mentioned, 24 years service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the morning after the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> when senators on this side of the chamber were not receiving many calls, I remember, John Armstrong called at my house and discussed the results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, I can remember that there was some difficulty in this chamber at the time of the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in May of last year when a senator on the Government side wanted to have a document incorporated in  Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All honourable senators will recall that during the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when  Mr McMahon  was Prime Minister he used a device called an auto-cue which did not always work properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we recall all the events leading up to 11 November we realise that the then Opposition was not satisfied to go the normal course of 3 years and face the Australian Labor Party at the normal <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can recall that in 1969 on the eve of a State <span class="highlight">election</span>, pressure from the country areas of Queensland on the Premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was so strong that he promised the country people that he would have a searching inquiry into these iniquitous confidential freight rate concessions and he appointed in 1969 a management services company named Beckingsale Management Services Pty Ltd. After 8 months it had completed its report but the year is now 1977 and the report has not seen the light of day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to draw some attention to the various alibis which this Government has adopted since it was elected for the failure of its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and the failure of its economic management, but before I do I shall contrast some of the failures with the promises that were made in 1975- the promise to restore business confidence, the promise to reduce inflation and the promise to slash unemployment by 200 000 people if this Government were elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second alibi used is the failure of the business community to respond to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government and become confident immediately upon the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Mr Fraser  ‘s Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that by 1978, or on whatever earlier date an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, this Government still will not have developed its policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The line ‘switch on the lights’ was repeated so often that it virtually became the catch phrase of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the time factor which is one matter that concerns me with the inevitability of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in October of this year, I think it will be necessary for the Distribution Commissioners to work quite swiftly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> was by secret postal ballot of the rank and file and the votes are currently being counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every 3 years or so there would be a presidential <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Constitution, the law, and parliamentary practice allow each Prime Minister to have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> on the same day as any Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He can have the House of Representatives and Senate elections on the same day simply by his own decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a ‘staggered’ <span class="highlight">election</span> system with half of the Senate coming up for <span class="highlight">election</span> every three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made that perfectly clear during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when he said that it would be a long hard struggle and a lot of slogging, and that it could take up to 3 years, before we saw what we would consider to be good economic recovery in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not a case of playing politics; it is a case of stating clearly what the Prime Minister saw the situation to be during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people no doubt expected a Father Christmas exercise almost immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless we all pull our weight it will be a longer and harder struggle than the Prime Minister said it would be in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to mention one or two references in the document, mainly because they represent more or less a repetition of the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises made by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 27 November 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> speeches, this Government promised a new deal for supporting fathers but nothing has been done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the same catchcry we heard prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had had an elected  president  during the time of the constitutional crisis, he would have had the power to do what  Sir John  Kerr did which was to dismiss us and send us to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the event that we could not agree to the carrying on of government by the granting of Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly came back from India with the opinion that Fernandes had taken the right stand in deciding that he would not take part in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that was about to be held because he thought that he could not campaign from detention in gaol and that the elections would be rigged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, wiser heads prevailed and the Socialist Party of India decided that it would take part in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign as part ofthe coalition which stood against the Congress Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of whether one supports Fernandes or the Congress Party the <span class="highlight">election</span> result is certainly a great turnaround from the position we saw in India and a great victory for democracy not only in that part of Asia but throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One only has to look at some of the speeches made during the Western Australian State <span class="highlight">election</span> to realise how the talks were used for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency: That the Federal Government has failed to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and prior to the commencement of that campaign we heard many statements from representatives of the parties who are now in government saying that there would be no cutbacks in money for Aboriginal affairs and that no one would be deprived of his just entitlement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 1976-77 Budget brought down by this Government, which  Mr Ellicott  said during the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> period would not impose any cuts at all, only served to highlight the callousness or the general thinking of the administrators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As if all these things were not enough, there appears to be an attempt to keep Aboriginal people from participating in elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from a letter I received from a voter at Fitzroy Crossing in relation to the recent State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was the most vicious intimidatory action I have yet seen any party apply to Aborigines in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This subjected each person who asked for help to a series of questions not applied to them in any previous <span class="highlight">election</span> nor to European electors in this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign both the party candidates had been given a hearing by all Aboriginal communities at Fitzroy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wanted to vote for Labor last <span class="highlight">election</span> but they muck me about for the first voting that was on 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is a matter which I could refer to the responsible Minister or was the honourable senator referring to a State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No <span class="highlight">election</span> has been held in Victoria to fill the vacancy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Federal Government has failed to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do not believe that  Senator Melzer  either has proved that this Government has failed to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very pleased to be following  Senator Bonner  in this debate because I was interested to hear what an Aboriginal senator would have to say about this urgency motion which has been moved against the Government for its failure to honour the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises made to the Aboriginal people prior to the December 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That the Federal Government has failed to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that it has been brought forward because it happens to be 1977 and there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Northern Territory in the year 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the matters brought up by the honourable senator who moved the motion had very little to do with whether the Federal Government had failed to honour its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to Aborigines, but I will come to that in a moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>First of all, I should like to go back to the situation of the housing associations in the Northern Territory prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year in the Northern Territory, the Labor Party, through a motion such as this, is endeavouring to pull the wool over the eyes of the people in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I assert that the health of the Aboriginal community in Australia has deteriorated since the dismissal of the Whitlam Government, and I endorse the remarks made earlier by my colleagues on this side of the chamber that the Fraser Government has indeed failed to keep its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises to the Australian Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a well known term in electoral discussions and is defined in one of the major dictionaries in the library as follows:  a method of arranging <span class="highlight">election</span> districts so that the political party making the arrangement will be enabled to elect a greater number of representatives than they could on a fair system . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the next <span class="highlight">election</span> he received 37.49 per cent of the vote and at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> he got 45.84 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> conducted on 2 March 1 968 the Labor Party, as the Government having to go the people, received 51.98 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I give  Senator Hall  credit for the fact that, because the contest was so close, when he had to go to the hustings because of a byelection he said that he would bring about electoral reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party won the <span class="highlight">election</span> with a majority of seven, with a very small increase in votes following the redistribution brought about by  Mr Hall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1973  Mr Dunstan  was again returned to Government after winning 5 1.52 per cent of the vote and the Liberal Party lost the  <span class="highlight">election</span> after  receiving 39.79 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770323_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He made no statement at all as to whether compulsory voting applied in various circumstances; whether there were elected to the House of Assembly in South Australia independents who supported the government of the day; or whether many seats were contested in those elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I cite as an example the 1959 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In that <span class="highlight">election</span> 2 1 of the 39 House of Assembly seats were uncontested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator McLaren  emphasised those elections last night and related the 1938 <span class="highlight">election</span> result to the fact that the Liberal Party in South Australia gained only 3 1 per cent of the votes in the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no question in  Senator Harradine  ‘s mind of the unions’ adhering to the law and conducting democratic elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He wants the Government to enter into another agreement so that it will not be necessary for such elections to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember the provisions for the collegiate system of voting and the 1 5 per cent provision relating to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a decision making body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He cited the case when in one <span class="highlight">election</span> 2 1 seats were uncontested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I am saying is that in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1953 a party which received 50.97 per cent of the vote remained in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In one <span class="highlight">election</span>, there were 2 1 uncontested seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But when all seats were contested in the March 1968 <span class="highlight">election</span>, Labor received 51.98 per cent of the votes and was defeated by a party that received 43.82 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country League Government was returned to office with 43.82 per cent of the vote in a fully contested <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Hall  has told us of the alteration which he claims has brought about one of the most democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1972, as some honourable senators may remember, was that <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government may need this time, but I suggest it should not need this time in view of the fact that at the end of 1975, during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, members and supporters of the present Government said continually that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a LiberalNational Country Party government would mean the survival and the increased affluence of the apple and pear growers, as well as other primary producers in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, in 1975 Government supporters told apple and pear growers in Tasmania with considerable vehemence that after a Liberal-National Country Party government won the <span class="highlight">election</span> they would be looked after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statement we are looking at does note some change in the position of the United States of America following  President  Carter’s <span class="highlight">election</span> and this needs to be examined by an Australian delegation for the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the establishment of the new Tertiary Education Commission the Government is redeeming one of its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following that, as a result of <span class="highlight">election</span> promises made during the 1960s, the Federal Government’s involvement in education increased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1969 the Labor Party gave an undertaking to establish a Schools Commission and during the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Whitlam  made a statement which I consider to be worthwhile quoting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Government followed this procedure and the Interim Committee was set up followed later by the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that that is really the essential point- that the reforms proposed by this legislation will provide better co-ordination of educational policies at the tertiary level, and it implements the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy on the need to coordinate the work of the educational commissions and in this case particularly the 3 tertiary education commissions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Prime Minister in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech 18 months ago state that a government which understands and can manage the Australian economy is essential to Australian prosperity and to the revival of business confidence? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy was clearly stated in the November-December <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Harradine ‘s major criticism seemed to me to be that the Government’s legislation does not require compulsory unionism, yet that in fact was the very first point under the heading of Organisations’ in the Government’s policy statement issued prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation was anticipated in speeches by Government candidates prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did this despite the fact that the Industrial Relations Bureau was part of our <span class="highlight">election</span> platform; in fact, it was quite an important plank in our policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the principle behind the legislation already had received wide public debate at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure also that the Medibank strike which occurred after the <span class="highlight">election</span> underlined the fact that the ordinary rank and file member wanted some form of redress and some way to say to his union executive if he felt as many of them did at that time that there was not enough consultation and, in a majority of instances, there was absolutely no consultation between the union bosses and the members of the union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I further ask: If the letter indicates that the Minister is advocating that the Federal Government break its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises on the environment and on Aboriginal affairs in order to push ahead with uranium mining in the Northern Territory, does not this pre-empt any recommendations which may be made by the second report of the Fox inquiry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770426_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that polling clerks are on duty for some 15 hours or more on polling days, will the Minister take some action before the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> to see that suitable heating is provided in polling booths where none exists at present? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will remember that in 1975 in its <span class="highlight">election</span> platform the Liberal Party said:  … we intend to take the matter further by having a White Paper developed for further discussion and investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government statements were issued concerning a White Paper on manufacturing industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At that time and during the course of that <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal and National Country parties undertook specifically to bring down in the Parliament a White Paper for discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet a month after the Wran Government was elected in New South Wales, the Prime Minister- ignoring the fact that there was a report on manufacturing industry known as the Jackson report and ignoring the structural difficulties that manufacturing industry had in Australia- in his typical, inane and inept way, had the temerity to suggest that the decline in the work force in New South Wales arose primarily as a result of  Mr Wran’s  <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The decision to abolish the Australian Development Aid Agency was taken within a few months of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was foreshadowed by  Sir Robert  Menzies in his 1 963 <span class="highlight">election</span> speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770427_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that there was once a  Senator Jack  Kane but that he was defeated at an <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales as long ago as May 1 974? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Has he seen a report in this morning’s  Sydney Morning Herald  under the signature of  Mr Peter  Bowers in which it is stated that the Prime Minister has warned or alerted officials of the Liberal Party that if the referendum fails to be carried he will bring on a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> before the Budget in order to find a time when it is more favourable to the Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was reported that the purpose of the referendum is that the Prime Minister is trying to find the most favourable time for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this not very clearly indicate that the Prime Minister’s stated reasons for holding the referendum are untrue; that the real reason is that the Prime Minister is fishing around to find the most suitable time for an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the hope that he will find a more appropriate time to return to office; and that the purpose of this referendum is to delay a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> as long as possible in the hope that he will have things in better shape than he has at the present time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why one has provisions within the Commonwealth Electoral Act, certainly within the Constitution and within our own Standing Orders, as to disputed returns on <span class="highlight">election</span> of senators, no matter how chosen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt that any honourable senator on my side of the chamber has not been to meetings of the Liberal Party where there have been requests that party affiliations of candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> be shown on ballot papers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the attention of the Minister representing the Attorney-General been drawn to the repeated assertion by  Senator Rae,  on behalf of the referendum No campaigners, that the simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> proposal makes no provision for simultaneous elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the Minister not, in debate on the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill in February, clearly dispose of this misleading and pettifogging assertion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the danger of the people being deceived by repetitive assertions of this nature, will the Minister reassure the public that they will achieve simultaneous elections, with all their attendant benefits, by voting for this proposal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter was canvassed in the debate on the Constitutional Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill 1977 in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal seeks to alter the Constitution to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That proposal also contains the provision that this Parliament is to make the laws for determining the times and places of elections of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have pointed out in the debate on this matter in the chamber before, an <span class="highlight">election</span> is not simply a polling day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> is a long process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite obvious from the nature of the proposal for simultaneous elections, coupled as it is with a proposal for this Parliament to make laws for the holding of Senate elections, that it will obviously be the purpose of any government to ensure that the <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate will be held at the same time as and on the same day as elections for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not necessarily the case that polling in an <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place everywhere in Australia on the same day, although naturally as we all know by and large that is the case, and that is what is to be intended to be the provision in this proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only time that it was put to the test was in the <span class="highlight">election</span> held in 1929 or 1930 when the then Prime Minister,  Mr Bruce,  went to the people on a platform of abolishing the system of conciliation and arbitration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate have been claiming continually that there is a necessity to have simultaneous elections of the Senate and the House of Representatives, I ask: Is it not a fact that simultaneous elections of the Senate and House of Representatives can be held simply at the request of the Prime Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also not a fact that in these austere times all that is necessary, with the Prime Minister talking about austerity, is for the Prime Minister to mount his push bike, go out to Yarralumla and see the GovernorGeneral and tell him that he wants an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives and the Senate at Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he took time off to read the High Court judgments in both the McKinlay case and the McKellar case, he would know that unless one wished to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large, it is not possible to take the House of Representatives out until a redistribution is made, certainly in accordance with the decision in the latter High Court case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator believes that it would be a good thing to have the House of Representatives elected at an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large instead of by single member constituencies let him say so, but I think there is a general desire, certainly by members of that place, for the single constituency member to continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that during 1975 in the frantic <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Government made lavish promises in respect of the older citizens in the country but has failed to provide the goods that these people were promised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Government now take the advice it so often gave when in Opposition, that is, have an immediate <span class="highlight">election</span> to allow the Australian electorate to make a judgment of its performance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770505_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 10 March I asked a question regarding the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee as to when an <span class="highlight">election</span> was to be held to replace  Mr David  Anderson who resigned on 28 February and when the next meeting of the NACC was to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation which we have had twice now in New South Wales, where people have had to fill in 70-odd squares the first time and 50-odd squares the next time, has turned the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> into somewhat of a lottery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first things we did when we came to office was to introduce legislation requiring compulsory secret ballots for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials, because we believed that this would encourage trade unionists to take a greater interest in their union leadership and would ensure that more responsible leaders were brought into a position in which they could protect the interests of trade union members throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does this not prove the truth of the No’ case that simultaneous elections for both Houses of the Parliament can be held at the decision of the Prime Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps what is really needed to carry the first question is a State government, as it is perfectly entitled to do under the present law, to refuse to issue the writs for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> when requested to do so by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it would be better still if each of the 6 State governments decided to hold Senate elections on a different Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If or when that happens it will be made perfectly clear to the people that the simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> provision in the Constitution can no longer be tolerated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He asked why the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  could not hold a conjoint House of Representatives and Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> next May, that is, hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives 6 months early and a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> about the normal time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I want to say this: First of all, the matter of simultaneous elections was all moonshine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The comrade-in-arms in the referendum campaign of  Mr Fraser  and  Mr Anthony-  I refer to  Mr Whitlam-  has stated publicly that the Prime Minister could bring the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> with the Senate in about May of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We said that it could be done, and everybody knew that, but the screen was put up and we were told that the referendum had to be passed so that we could have simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody knows that the prime reason why the Prime Minister and  Mr Anthony  proposed this referendum question was to delay the half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> until things are better so that it would not have an adverse reflection on the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> 6 months later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So this fabrication was put forward and then their comradeinarms,  Mr Whitlam,  blew the gaff when he said that the Prime Minister should hold the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the same time as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the recent referendum campaign relating to simultaneous elections it was frequently stated as an argument that this Senate should not have the right to send the other House of Parliament to an <span class="highlight">election</span> without itself going to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to know, for the record, whether this Senate has sent the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> on its own or whether on each occasion that the Senate has caused an <span class="highlight">election</span> there has been a double dissolution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the arguments during the campaign, I would like to know whether this chamber has ever sent the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> on its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr. Fraser was asked for his reaction to the call by Mr Whitlam for a general <span class="highlight">election</span>- for the Hose of Representatives and half the Senate -in  ky.  Mr Fraser  said: ‘I believe that a governent should be allowed to run its full term, i a matter of fact, I believe that 3 years is not 10: enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>!&gt; take that a bit further, if one looks at  H,sard  one sees that  Senator Withers  is on record as saying- I think it was some time in Ail 1974- that immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span> 0the Labor Government in 1972 the then Liberal-Country Party coalition set about getting t’ Labor Government out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is right, and have a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When honourable senators opposite are in Opposition they will do anything to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> because they have nothing to lose and they have a chance of government, but when they are in government they do not want an <span class="highlight">election</span> because they have a lot to lose and because they know that there will be a change of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure the people will not forget this incident at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, whenever that may be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been most emphatic in stating that a Yes vote on the referendum for simultaneous elections was not needed because simultaneous elections could be held without that vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what  Senator Wood  does not go on to tell the people and what none of his colleagues in the No campaign told the people is that, whilst they are not prepared to sacrifice any of their term of office for which they were elected under the present Constitution, they are quite happy to have members in another place sacrifice some part of their term of office of 3 years to bring about a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They said we can have simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  has called for an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But those eleven or twelve rebels opposite have it in their hands to cause a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held in May next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we will have a simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <span class="highlight">election</span> were held in April next year, after the Appropriation Bills had been opposed, instead of retiring on 30 June those senators would have to go out about 2 months before they want to go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, they did not hoodwink the people as a whole because 62 percent of the electors in this magnificent country voted for simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I venture to say that if the proposal for simultaneous elections had been carried the Senate would have been given more power and responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators who want to force members of the House of Representatives to an <span class="highlight">election</span> have to weigh up whether half of themselves are prepared to face an <span class="highlight">election</span> also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot tell me it is democratic when a proposal for simultaneous elections cannot be carried when 62 per cent of Australians are in favour of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said:   ‘it was nonsense to say that the simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> proposal could lead to abolition of the Senate’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the things that this Government has to explain to the people at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am hoping, as I said before, that  Senator Wood  and his colleagues will have the courage of their convictions and will put the Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span> next April because they have the power to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, with a Queensland <span class="highlight">election</span> coming up before that time and in view of the way the present Queensland Premier behaves in misleading the people and misappropriating public funds, to use the words which came out of the mouth of the present Prime Minister, there is every possibility that there will be a Labor Premier in Queensland despite the gerrymander. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there will be 4 States that will be agreeable to the issue of writs for an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate in April next year if  Senator Wood  and his colleagues- and  Senator Bonner  is one of them- have the intestinal fortitude to carry out what they say should be done; that is, that there was no need to have a referendum for the holding of simultaneous elections because the Senate can bring on an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will have the opportunity in May or April when the Appropriation Bills come in to bring on an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great goal of this <span class="highlight">election</span> is to put Australia back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Coleman spoke about broken <span class="highlight">election</span> promises, as did quite a number of Opposition senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At <span class="highlight">election</span> time Ministers make policy guarantees to people about matters for which the Government will legislate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since my <span class="highlight">election</span> to this place I have snared, and still share, many of the views put forward by the 3 previous speakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on Saturday of this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Point McLeay Council agreed out of court to hold elections on Saturday of this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did ask during the Estimates Committee hearings who would be responsible for the cost of that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the issue of that writ, the council has agreed to hold elections which it did not want to hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why it did not want to hold the <span class="highlight">election</span> is known to the officer, known to myself and known to many other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also asked the officer whether, if the result of the elections on Saturday next was that there would be no further antagonism by the Point McLeay Council towards the directors of the Ralkon Agricultural Company, the Department would then pay the $63,000 grant to which this company is entitled but which has been withheld because the Department has no confidence in the manager of that company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have every confidence in this man and they have also signed a petition of no confidence in the present members of the Point McLeay Council who come up for re-<span class="highlight">election</span> on Saturday of this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no appropriation made to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill his position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the conditions of appointment provision is made to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Aboriginals living in his electoral area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I said,  Senator Wright,  related to a council <span class="highlight">election</span> which is a different matter from the Ralkon Agricultural Co. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770526_senate_30_s73/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to express some general concern about the question of the Regional Employment Development scheme in the light of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of December 1975 that the Scheme, which the Labor Government in the Budget of 1975 had announced would be phased out, would be restored by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise made by this Government in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of problems of that sort I am concerned to find out whether the additional appropriation of $ 1 20,000 is seen in some way as a fulfilment of those <span class="highlight">election</span> promises or for what other purpose that additional amount is being appropriated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can he assure the Senate that the AUS <span class="highlight">election</span> processes are fair, democratic and properly conducted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a great deal of discussion whether the <span class="highlight">election</span> processes of the AUS are democratic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first step towards the relief of unemployment in New South Wales would be to direct the attention of  Senator O  ‘Byrne to the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Wran Labor Government to employ all of the unemployed teachers in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if 700 teachers are unemployed in New South Wales no doubt  Senator O  ‘Byrne and his colleagues will ask  Mr Wran  when he is going to keep his <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under an amendment proposed by clause 6 of the Bill, such an <span class="highlight">election</span> may be made only where the market value of the trading stock is greater than the cost or replacement price adopted by the former owner or owners in their income tax returns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments I now propose will preclude an <span class="highlight">election</span> being made under the section in respect of transfers of interests in company shares and securities or other choses in action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments will not, however, withdraw any rights to lodge elections under section 36a in relation to transfers of interests in such property if it is established that they took place before 24 May 1977, the day on which the amendments were foreshadowed in the second reading speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One recalls that there have been 2 State elections since the handover of the railways, one in Tasmania and one in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia in particular the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> was fought on the transfer of railways, and the people of that State agreed with the measures taken by the South Australian Government in effecting the transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> was brought forward by some 12 months or more because of the fact that the Liberal Oppposition in South Australia at the time was making all sorts of noises about the illegalities and the ramifications of such a transfer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Dunstan  fought the <span class="highlight">election</span> on that issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He won the <span class="highlight">election</span> and he is still Premier of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was not the mere <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us look at what he had to say in one of his leaked letters when a State <span class="highlight">election</span> was coming on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-Before I ask my question,  Mr President,  I seek your indulgence to express to the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Government in the Senate my appreciation of the congratulatory remarks they made on my <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position of  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission to  Mr Justice  Hope will fulfil both parts of the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I had performed 2 weeks ago the way I am performing today perhaps I would have been up for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> was brewing in New Zealand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will oppose this Bill because we believe that it is an example of a retraction on the part of this Government from the policy which it enunciated in 1975 in the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least the Government, during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1 975, said that this full tax indexation would be introduced and in fact made a claim that by introducing it in 1976 full tax indexation would be introduced in one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Wriedt  has been making out a case that there is a retraction by the Government of some <span class="highlight">election</span> promise; but in fact there is no retraction of any promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is total tax indexation and it is not a retraction of any policy that was stated before the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> or at any time since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way can this be regarded as a betrayal of this Government’s stated promises before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> or since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770531_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One will recall that it claimed at <span class="highlight">election</span> time that it would employ all unemployed teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause provides for a fancy change of words to give the impression that the Government is honouring an <span class="highlight">election</span> reform that it said it would introduce if elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But let us look at the original proposal before the Government decided that it had to carry out paragraph 3 of its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1973 before an <span class="highlight">election</span> New South Wales Premier Askin promised an industrial relations Act with very repressive measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>After  Sir Robert  Askin won the <span class="highlight">election</span> the proposal was forgotten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first step, of course, was taken some 12 months ago and that was the introduction of legislation which involved compulsory secret ballots for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of union officials, the object being to encourage trade unionists throughout Australia to take a more active interest in ensuring responsible leadership, to the mutual benefit of the trade union concerned and the individual trade unionist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always paid tribute to  Senator Hall  in the past for being a Premier who brought about some form of democratic electoral redistribution in South Australia, even though he was forced to do so because he made a rash promise in regard to a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for the seat of Millicent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After he had won back the premiership of South Australia at that <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Dunstan  admitted that, unfortunately, what he proposed to do was not possible because he had discovered that the terms of the River Murray Agreement prevented action by him which would result in the Chowilla Dam being constructed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Wriedt  chose to pursue the theme that this legislation is necessary because of some thought of an early <span class="highlight">election</span> on the part of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Parliament has been prostituted in order to instigate a political confrontation with the trade union movement, in order to ‘set up’ an <span class="highlight">election</span> late this year in the sure knowledge that the appalling state of the economy- and unemployment . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To divert the debate on to issues relating to an <span class="highlight">election</span> is quite irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government wants to have this legislation so that, when it goes to an early <span class="highlight">election</span> or supports the campaign being run in the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> by  Dr Tonkin,  it can show that it has made a move against industrial anarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Dunstan Government, with very considerable reserves in its capital accounts, is crying poor mouth it is doing it purely for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the overall result would be that if the Liberal Party polled as well at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> as it did in 1975 that party would win the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the new boundaries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable senator is quite right in saying that on the boundaries that are coming out at the moment we will certainly win the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, the one after and the one after no matter how many redistributions take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think two areas that could be given better attention than has been the case in the past are firstly, the remuneration of people operating in the Antarctic bases and secondly- I have raised this with the Minister before in Estimate Committee hearings- the right of people in the Antarctic to vote and the ability of those people to be able to cast their votes in elections and referenda and matters of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course under our present arrangements it is not possible for these people to exercise their democratic right of a vote at elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the situation can be corrected because it is one of the fundamental rights of people to be able to cast their vote at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Contrary to the grandiose promises in  Mr Fraser  ‘s <span class="highlight">election</span> speech, we have seen the following: Industrial confidence has declined; manufacturing output has declined; real wage rates have declined; dwelling house construction has declined; unemployment has risen; the number of loans made by major institutions for all new dwellings has declined from 22,700 to 19,800 between the last quarter of 1976 and first quarter of 1977; total new private capital expenditure declined by 2.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1977; and the Sydney share market indices for manufacturing industry are at one of their lowest points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this basis how can the Prime Minister claim that the whole exercise is not an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently, the latest gallup poll in the  Bulletin  a fortnight ago was headed ‘Labor would win federal <span class="highlight">election</span>: The electoral support for the Labor Party is higher than for the Liberal and Country Parties’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to these things simply because, as I said at the outset, before another Budget is brought down there will be a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was amused when the Premier of South Australia decided to make the main <span class="highlight">election</span> issue the matter of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the 1973 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign  Mr Dunstan  boldly and loudly promised that he would build a petrochemical works at Redcliff at a cost of $300m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two members of the House of Representatives who should be in unity to win the State <span class="highlight">election</span> are fighting each other for the seat of Wakefield in South Australia to see who gains Liberal Party pre-selection for that seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is one reason why a South Australian Liberal senator said going home last weekend that he could not get enthusiastic about the State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘You cannot get enthusiastic when you know the results of the <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows what the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course  Mr Dunstan  said he would fight the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the unemployment issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Not only Don Dunstan but also Bjelke-Petersen want an <span class="highlight">election</span> in their respective States to condemn this Government for the unemployment level which it has created in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The whole purpose of the political propaganda is that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held and they know that the result will be hopeless for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although I have raised this very important matter on those occasions, it appears that the Government as yet has taken no action to carry out a promise which was made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  in the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This meeting or representatives of 29 Unions declares that if the attacks on Bob Watling and Peter Imlach are allowed to succeed the result will lead to the destruction of the Tasmanian Labor Government and Labor’s chance in the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">Election</span> and will pave the way for a procommunist takeover of the TTLC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If some honourable senators on this side have an interest in a pro-communist takeover of the trade union movement they at least should heed the other part of that resolution declaring that it those two top officials are axed it will lead to the destruction of the Labor Government in Tasmania and Labor’s chances in the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is this not yet another example of cheap headline grabbing by the South Australian Government in the course of a State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, which is totally illogical, devoid of economic principle, and designed to confuse the South Australian people as to the real issues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since his <span class="highlight">election</span> to office, the Prime Minister has seriously damaged the Liberal Party and cast aside the stability and sense of direction of earlier times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember reading the headline in 1973, during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, which said that  Mr Dunstan  was going to build a $300m petrochemical works at Redcliff near Port Augusta. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party knows that there is to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia and it has introduced this motion so that it can go back to South Australia with a story of propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been mentioned in this debate that it has put forward at each <span class="highlight">election</span> for, I think, the past several elections the proposition of a petro-chemical works in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can go through the many empty promises of the Labor Government in South Australia and know that they are just <span class="highlight">election</span> bait and nothing more, bait that takes the South Australian public for a ride at each <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first person I wish to speak about is  Mr David  Llewellyn who, as was said last night, will be a candidate for the Australian Labor Party at the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should like to remind  Senator Grimes  that there was a vast difference also between the percentage of votes in the Senate for the ALP in Tasmania at the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and the percentage at the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770907_senate_30_s74/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think  Senator Douglas  McClelland would agree with me that in the vital national <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns in  1969, 1972, 1974  and  1975-I  think this is the nicest comment that I can personally apply to Les Haylen- Les Haylen did not feel it infra dig to be out on the street corners in the electorate of Evans where his family lived putting a point of view to the people on the kerbside. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770913_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The background to that report was the promise made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during the last Tasmanian State <span class="highlight">election</span> that he would get the Grants Commission to review the needs of local government following complaints by the Tasmanian Premier that his State was being disadvantaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we are rapidly reaching a stage at which we need to provide funds to these local authorities in order to pay the aldermen and alderwomen to carry out their activities so that any person who wishes to nominate, stand and achieve <span class="highlight">election</span> should be able to carry out the work of local authority representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to remind ourselves that immediately before the 1972 general <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Party promised the people of Australia that it would maintain the existing subsidies, that is, the direct per capita grants based on a 20 per cent principle that the McMahon Government had brought in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770914_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I indicated that the Department of the Capital Territory, in close co-ordination and co-operation with other interested departments, would prepare detailed proposals on the financial and administrative arrangements for submission to the Government and that the Government would ensure that the proposals would be available to Territory residents before the next Assembly <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without trying to be political at all, which I have no desire to be, I must confess it is somewhat of a surprise because, as I understand it,  Mr Neilson  took his party to an <span class="highlight">election</span> not very long ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The strategy outlined before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of December 1975 by the present Government was a fantasy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Senator Cotton)  has said in criticism of the Whitlam Labor Government, I should tell him that the public now realises that in our three years of government we had three elections to face, two of which were double dissolutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The public are now determined to give us, when the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> comes, a further opportunity because not one person in Australia can name any accomplishment of this present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing full well that there had to be at least a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> this financial year, the Government jettisoned all previous strategies and opted for tax cuts, on the basis of which it opportunistically asserted a deliberate change to a consumer led recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister is trying to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> before the end of this year because he knows that he does not have a snowball’s chance in hell of winning an <span class="highlight">election</span> next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course we know that the Labor Party’s object is to destroy stability in this community so as to undermine confidence in the Government and hopefully bring an <span class="highlight">election</span> in its favour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, the Labor Government in South Australia could have won the <span class="highlight">election</span> with less than 50 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For  Mr Dunstan  to claim satisfaction from the result of the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> is again a typical example of the Labor Party over emphasising the success of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this an example of the private sector taking up the slack, or when can we expect the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises of the Government to improve private business confidence and slash unemployment to be realised? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 therefore ask the Minister whether the Department, at least, is anticipating an early <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Collard, like most members of the Liberal and National Country Parties, has obviously forgotten Tasmania, which is usually forgotten by those parties except when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is taking place, because he said that Queensland is the only State which has more people living outside its capital city than inside it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are also proud of our Government, and our pride was borne out by the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> on Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If I could go back to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government in South Australia in 1965, most of us who have taken some interest in public transport in South Australia realise that it was  Mr Walsh  who made provision for car parks at many suburban railway stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government were sincere in its stated <span class="highlight">election</span> policy that it would decrease the numbers of unemployed, this is one area in which it could bring about a massive decrease in unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a report in the Sydney  Sun oi 21  September last in which the Wran Government is accused of breaking an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise on education funding for New South Wales independent schools? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apartheid was a word, an <span class="highlight">election</span> slogan introduced in 1948 by  Mr Malan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It won the <span class="highlight">election</span> and has had increasing support ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are on the verge of a law and order <span class="highlight">election</span>, and Government senators say that if it is good enough to be a law it has to be obeyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if we look at what has happened in the Australian Capital Territory since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government we can see very clearly how inept the Government is at economic management, how prejudiced it is when it encounters the public sector and how obtruse the Government remains about the real relationship between the public and the private sectors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason  Mr Fraser  wants an early <span class="highlight">election</span> is that he feels he can get himself another threee  years by going now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last days of the Labor Government and in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign it certainly was a matter of great debate and concern by us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Durack  was acting as if he were still fighting the 1955 <span class="highlight">election</span> when he told us how wonderful things were back in 1952. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rumours are going about now that are causing much unease m all circles- particularly the business circles which are bothered about the economic future of this country- that the Government will be calling an early <span class="highlight">election</span> and that it will be going to the polls in December of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no constitutional pressure or other form of pressure that would stop the Government governing for another year, but it is talking about going to an early <span class="highlight">election</span> and will not deny that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the only reason which could take the Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like the honourable senator to tell us later if she gets the opportunity to do so- if the Government Whip has been sufficiently negligent to have put her on the speakers’ list- why it is that the Government is talking about having an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year, one year before its time, if it is not because of the Government’s fear about the dreadful condition in which the economy will be next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government is talking about it; the Press is talking about it;  Mr Nixon  is talking about it and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  is undertaking an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Senator Archer  is now going to give a categorical denial that there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year I would like to hear him do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If he is not to do it, other members of the Liberal Party, seeing that they seem to be concerned at the suggestion that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year, will have the opportunity in a few moments to stand up and give a categorical denial to scotch these malicious rumours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am glad to see that  Senator Archer  at least, for one, has said that he is firmly opposed to an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year and has said that he believes that only a slanderous person would make such a suggestion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I go on to say that despite  Senator Archer’s  strong opposition to the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span> there are many people within the Liberal Party who are in favour of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For no other reason than the fear of the wrath of the Australian people if the Government waited to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> at the appropriate time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know- there has been a hint of it today by  Senator Durack-  that an effort will be made to say that the Moscow-line communists, the Pekingline communists or some other people in Melbourne are an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think the question still has to be asked: If they are an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue, how does it come about? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is it that the Government could do after an <span class="highlight">election</span> which it cannot do before an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What powers is it lacking, with a majority in both Houses of the Federal Parliament, that it would have after an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is talking of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is setting the stage for an <span class="highlight">election</span> because of its admission of its total failure economically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government does scurry to the polls with perhaps the permission of the Governor-General, who may well feel that the best time for an <span class="highlight">election</span> is always the time that suits the Liberal Party best, whoever is in government, I believe that the people will give the proper answer to it when it takes this reckless and unprincipled step. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I say a few words that hopefully will be constructive in some measure, let me say that if thoughts of an <span class="highlight">election</span> are not generating much excitement in many fields they certainly are generating an extraordinary measure of excitement in  Senator Wheeldon,  who left his seat and paraded around the aisle as he became more and more enthralled in the question whether there should or should not be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject of my remarks was  Mr David  McNicol, a journalist attached to the  Bulletin,  a weekly publication, and in particular the actions by  Mr McNicol  in 1965 when he falsified a news report which appeared in the Sydney  Daily Telegraph  of which he was then editor in order to secure political advantage for the Liberal Party in New South Wales in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> which was then pending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point I wish to raise concerns the speculation about an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is, of course, quite apparent that this Government and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in particular are desperate to conduct an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year instead of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is desperate to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year because it fears the wrath of the electors next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister clearly was preparing to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the uranium issue until he became aware of the relative unpopularity of the Government’s view on this issue and particularly its unpopularity with one of its traditionally strong areas of support, the female voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The logic of the situation, had the Government proceeded with this plan and even had it survived an <span class="highlight">election</span> and lost 25 seats, is interesting to say the least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One must speculate what the Government’s reaction would have been, having lost 25 seats in a uranium <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other more recent excuse to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> is industrial unrest which is deliberately exacerbated by this Government and by Liberal and National Party governments in Victoria and Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is apparent, having found that the uranium issue was likely to be counterproductive, that the Government is now paving the way for an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the question of industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again this question arises: Let us suppose the Government holds an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this issue and survives the <span class="highlight">election</span> but loses 20 or 25 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is absolutely no need or justification for a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> being called on the issue of industrial unrest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason  Mr Fraser  wants an <span class="highlight">election</span> is that he feels he can get himself another three years by going now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, of course, everyone knows that whatever statement is made by a person in the present Opposition, there is no way that person has any effective political power, at least until after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All these attempts to obtain a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> are transparently cynical. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to have been accepted, virtually without question, that if the Government decides to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That view ignores what I believe is the very important role of the Governor-General, should  Mr Fraser  officially decide to ask for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the Prime Minister-  to seek a dissolution of Parliament simply because he would like to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> long before it is due . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Precedents were set in 1904, 1905 and 1909 when Governors-General rejected requests by the Prime Ministers of the day for premature elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are precedents for a Governor-General refusing to accede to a request from a Prime Minister for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Governor-General will accede to a request from the Prime Minister for an <span class="highlight">election</span> should such a request be made because the Governor-General knows very well that if he grants an <span class="highlight">election</span> for no better reason than that the Prime Minister wants one, he will have tacitly admitted that the function of the Governor-General as perceived by him is to grant the Liberal Party an <span class="highlight">election</span> whenever it believes it can win, irrespective of whether it is in government or in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Governor-General will grant a request for a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>, given that knowledge, with one possible exception which I will mention later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has drawn to the attention of this Parliament and many other people the reasons for the story doing the rounds today that we possibly will have an <span class="highlight">election</span> before the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Walsh should be thanked for what he has exposed here in relation to the proposed actions of the Prime Minister, who goes around the country dropping little syllables here and there-  Mr Nixon  does it;  Mr Anthony  does it; and I think one of the other Cabinet Minister did it the other day in a certain place, I think it was the Minister for Defence,  Mr Killen-  trying to put the people on edge by hinting that there may be an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the offing in the very near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Country Parties want an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is guaranteed, of course, that if the Prime Minister goes to an <span class="highlight">election</span> he will come back with fewer seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has the numbers now; so there is no need for him to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>- except, as I will point out, for one thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the main reason why the Prime Minister will go to the polls; he well knows, as  Senator Hall  has pointed out, that even if he is defeated at the <span class="highlight">election</span> a Labor Government, which is the alternative, would not be allowed to govern because we would not have the numbers in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, that we cannot have a successful and democratic trial of this Government at the next House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be a no-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party will be unable to obtain a majority in this chamber at the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Walsh  has pointed out tonight, the present Leader of the Government is on record in the Senate  Hansard  as saying on more than one occasion that immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1972 he and others in the Liberal Party set about destroying the Labor Government despite the fact that the Labor Party had been elected by a majority of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the method of <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Senate- with half the members of the Senate going to the people every three years- we were not able to get the numbers to pass legislation in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Hall  has rightly pointed out- it now looks almost certain because of the way the present Government has got the country into an economic mess, with rising unemployment which is the worst since the last Depression- even if  Mr Fraser  holds an <span class="highlight">election</span> in December and is the loser he will still ride roughshod over the democratically elected government because he will have the numbers in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I can understand  Senator Hall’s  concern because he was the victim of the same sort of thing when he was the Premier of South Australia, when he had to contend with a person named  Mr Renfrey  De Garis who even though he was in the same party- he was the Leader of the upper House- went on record as saying: ‘Why do you want a democratic <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Council in South Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are some of the reasons why the Prime Minister wants an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We then find a Western Australian Liberal member saying that he will not stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> again because he cannot stand the methods used by the present Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the present Prime Minister has to wait another IS months for an <span class="highlight">election</span> the pot will boil over and he will be in real trouble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister does not hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> before Christmas we well may live to see the day, in the not too distant future, when that will eventuate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about an <span class="highlight">election</span> because the hints are being dropped every day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be happy if  Senator Kilgariff  could tell this Senate that there is not going to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> and put the people’s minds at rest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We would like to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> because we know from looking at the gallup polls and the rising unemployment figures, to which I shall refer in a few moments, that we would be returned to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would welcome an <span class="highlight">election</span>, because we are ready whenever he is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was elected in the first place for a term of six years but, because of the unsatisfactory way in which this Senate operates, I had to face two more elections even before my first six-year term finished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I got back each time and I suppose I can say to  Senator Kilgariff  that there is more certainty that I will be back here after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, whenever it is, than that he will be back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The document in question is entitled ‘National Country Party of Australia Policy Speech: 1975 <span class="highlight">Election</span>, delivered by Right Honourable J. D.

  <li>
    <p>You would really think it was a Labor Party speech before an <span class="highlight">election</span>, because the wheel has turned and history is repeating itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The great goal of this <span class="highlight">election</span> is to put Australia back on its feet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Unemployment was an issue in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia on 17 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no way can he present and develop an argument as to the <span class="highlight">election</span> and unseating of governments that in any way will justify the uncontrollable attitude that his party adopted towards Australian finances when it was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essence of the result of the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> is simply that the Australian Labor Party, despite the method by which it confronted the Australian people, was found wanting by the Austraiian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, in answer to  Senator McLaren,  I would say that no fulminations and no causes of <span class="highlight">election</span> can hide the fact that the members of the public have tested the Labor Party and found it to be wanting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, there are ample opportunities for the people of Australia to demonstrate their needs, to demonstrate their wishes and to demonstrate their concern not only on the issue of uranium and unemployment but also on the vital issue of broken promises, promises that were made prior to, during and after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this Government in December 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can he say when the result of the Industrial Registrar’s investigation into the irregularities of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union will be made known so that the Government can take any action which may be necessary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The investigation into the irregularities of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union <span class="highlight">election</span> referred to by  Senator Walters  was carried out by what was then the Arbitration Inspectorate of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that investigation, the union is in the process of conducting a fresh <span class="highlight">election</span> for the office of federal national organiser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South Australia the federal executive of the union has taken a decision to conduct a new <span class="highlight">election</span> for the office of State secretary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latter <span class="highlight">election</span> is scheduled to take place immediately after completion of the ballot for national organiser, which closes on 1 7 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is rather ironic that in this sort of economic environment the Government has the audacity to be talking about, contemplating, suggesting or floating the rumour that a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite do not do anything about the re-establishment of a scheme of that nature between now and the next <span class="highlight">election</span> they will really be in great electoral difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without doubt the most revealing indicator of the Fraser Government’s concern about its ecomomic performances is the obvious obsession of the Prime Minister with the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span> after only two years in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an early <span class="highlight">election</span> is contemplated there can be only one motive behind the Government’s stategy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that that will be shown in the byelection for the Cunningham electorate on Saturday, 15 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is quickly running out of electoral support, as will be shown by the people in the Cunningham by-<span class="highlight">election</span> on Saturday, 15 October. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate has had the pleasure of listening to  Senator Douglas  McClelland expounding eloquently on the reasons why an <span class="highlight">election</span> should not be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can well understand why no member of the Australian Labor Party wants an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can understand why they do not ever want elections to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether there is any truth to the speculation which they have been fuelling so carefully, but I say to them that we on this side can all understand their desire that there should be no <span class="highlight">election</span> for as long as possible because they know they could not win it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He alleged that the visit to Club Marconi was an electioneering stunt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was set up months ago and it was conducted in a low key manner quite unlike an <span class="highlight">election</span> rally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a start, I place on record that my <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate in 1 974 depended upon the Liberal vote in Labor seats in the western suburbs of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 205,466 people who voted Liberal at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, and in none of those seats did the Liberal Party get less than 37 per cent of the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, and he also implied that the honourable member for Prospect,  Dr Klugman,  might be in danger of holding the seat in an <span class="highlight">election</span> or in danger of holding it in a preselection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I can say to  Senator Baume  is that I confidently expect, also as a senator from New South Wales, that after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> all of those six seats will be held by the Labor Party and that there will be a very large swing in the seat of Prospect towards the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has been going backwards and forwards across this country raising speculation about whether there will in fact be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just put it to the Senate: How can there be any sense of business certainty at all with everybody speculating daily as to whether there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the most recent example of the extent of the rejection of this Budget was the results of the elections that have been held in South Australia and also in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They supported Labor candidates in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia and in the local government elections in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> I was elected by only a very narrow margin and perhaps I could say that that was because of the 200,000-odd people in those North Shore safe Liberal electorates who voted for the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the local government elections in the electorate of Mackellar two councils were involvedthe Warringah Shire Council and the Manly Municipal Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the elections for both of those councils for the first time Labor Party people have been elected to the councils on the official ALP ticket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This happened in spite of a very strong attack against the endorsed Labor candidates by the honourable member for Mackellar,  Mr Wentworth,  who in the adjournment debate in the other place on the Thursday night before the local government elections were held called the Labor Party candidates, amongst other things ‘fifth column candidates’ and asked all people who lived in the Warringah Shire and the Manly municipal area to put the Labor candidates last on the ballot paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indications are that inflation is now running at slightly under 10 per cent per annum, so it can be claimed fairly by our Government that despite the great problems caused by inflation which confronted it at the time of its <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975, substantial progress has been made in reducing the rate of inflation to a more realistic level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Then he made great play of the wonderful result his Government got in the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like to remind him of the percentage of votes the Liberal and National Country parties did get and the number of seats they got with that vote under the old system of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Labor Party polled 3,313,004 votes, or 42.8 per cent, and we won 36 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No, it was not through the ballot box after the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was through actions taken by a Liberal Premier in New South Wales and a Country Party Premier in Queensland who is now seeking re-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we read the barometers correctly and if we can believe all the chit chat thrown around by various Ministers, unless those Ministers have been misinformed by their parties, there will be another <span class="highlight">election</span> before Christmas and the people of Australia will be able to make a comparison: three years of Labor and two governmentsone of 17 months and another of about 18 months- compared with two years of LiberalNational Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am sure that when the results go up on the tally board after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> is held there will be a great difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers  was on record- I referred to this yesterday- as saying that immediately after the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span> the coalition parties set out to bring about the downfall of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think of the position in my State where the Government has nine out of ten Parliamentary representatives in the House of Representatives and this year has six out of the ten representatives in the Senate to illustrate that it is the quality of the candidates and the policies that we espoused at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that brought about this result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But honourable senators opposite did not tell the people that during the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Scott in his speech went on to talk about how the Government within the first few months of its <span class="highlight">election</span> increased the first advance payment for wheat by 20 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the wheat growers of this country know full well that for 15 years prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government in 1972 there was no increase in the first advance payment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a Labor State is involved they will go out- probably in a few weeks dme when questions are asked at <span class="highlight">election</span> rallies- and say to people who ask why the States are not getting money for sewerage schemes that that is the responsibility of the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Senator Mulvihill  put it in the terms of our being on the verge of a law and order <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do not have elections in Australia in that sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country in recent times basically has been about the government of the country, about the running of the economy and about those who are most able to develop the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had elections that perhaps were thought would be elections on other issues, but basically the Australian people are concerned with what group of men and women is best capable of continuing to operate the economy of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I put aside the suggestions about an early <span class="highlight">election</span> as quite useless rumours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also need an end to the damaging speculation about an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To have a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> in December just as we are beginning to get inflation down would bring about a deep, self-inflicted wound. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  should end the <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation now and get on with the job of improving the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of us went up and down the countryside in May of this year arguing in the referendum campaign against the highly undesirable situation whereby governments and parliaments in the past have come to an early end because of the need to bring the two Houses together in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was also interested to read certain comments by  Mr Whitlam  in the  Age  of this day about <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Whitlam  said that if he were in  Mr Fraser’s  place- thank goodness he is not- he would kill the <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I think it is desirable that we should have less of the <span class="highlight">election</span> fever that has been and is around the place and that we should concentrate on developing the courage of industry and the courage of those people who alone can make the future of this country successful in an economic sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would think the Government intends to fight the next <span class="highlight">election</span> against an army of unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It looks as though the Government wishes to fight the next <span class="highlight">election</span> against an army of unemployed and so long as the Government has a lack of understanding in the industrial field and its supporters continue blindly to make the remarks about the trade union movement that have been uttered by the two previous Liberal speakers, I am afraid there is very little hope unless the Government resigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the people of Australia who have taken notice of this debate will take that into account at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, whenever that might occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me simply say that those unemployed teachers who were given an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that all unemployed teachers would get a job would regard it as a great non-success, seeing that  Mr Wran  falls short by several thousand of keeping that promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that there was a recent <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position of Federal Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation, that some dispute has now arisen about that <span class="highlight">election</span> and that proceedings have been instituted in the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, this included $8m arising out of Schools Commission recommendations that there be a percentage link between the per capita cost in a non-government school and the average cost in a State school; $3m in our judgment responding to the earlier indication by the Schools Commission that there was need for more capital in new growth areas and that capital to be applied through the State planning committees, and $2m for levels one and two schools in furtherance of our own mandate and <span class="highlight">election</span> policies and in the spirit of the Schools Commission’s recommendations that there should be basic per capita grants, Federal and State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course in this circumstance one is entitled to ask: Why all the speculation about an early <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771012_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister tell the Senate whether the New South Wales Government has done anything in its new Budget to overcome the great difficulties it has created for teachers in that State and whether it will be able to meet its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to employ all trained teachers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am aware that an essential plank of the Wran Labor Party’s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy was that it would employ all unemployed teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One was the statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Liberal and Country parties would switch the lights back on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only when the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  with his nose to the political wind, discovered that he was running out of popularity that he decided to use this again as a gimmick quite recently, just in case an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held on 3 December or 10 December or whatever date it may be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister loses his nerve I suppose an <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I do not care whether the Government calls an <span class="highlight">election</span> because after the <span class="highlight">election</span>- whether it is held in the middle of December or in April or May of next year-  Senator Withers  will be sitting on this side of the House and we will be sitting on the opposite side of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government can have an <span class="highlight">election</span> when it likes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>With all the chattering that honourable senators opposite are doing about elections, they are not endeavouring to stifle any of these criticisms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the Liberal-National Country Parties’ <span class="highlight">election</span> promises was to increase and encourage research and development of alternative energy resources in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that there are many people in Australia who will remember that when the next <span class="highlight">election</span> comes about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is in error, or if honourable senators opposite believe that its present leadership nas become discredited, they should be encouraging students to do what they ought to do- participate in the meetings which lead to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of officers at the very top of AUS. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a farce, it is a sham and it is a smokescreen for the creation of an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Government’s excuse for holding an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endorse the remarks of  Senator Douglas  McClelland to the effect that the Government wants to introduce the legislation as an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy because it believes that it cannot win at the polls next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The suggestion is not that it will mean six months plus another three years of office for this governmentbut that the Government will be in office for six months only if it does not get an <span class="highlight">election</span> now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, for the purposes of an <span class="highlight">election</span>, we are having legislation rushed through this House, without honourable senators knowing what it is all about and suffering from an inability to study it in the time available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the situation which the Prime Minister needs to justify an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has already made up his mind apparently that there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December  (Quorum formed). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 Labor senator on the ticket for the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> is a man who does not believe that this Bill should pass through all stages without delay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is to be a May <span class="highlight">election</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberal Movement leader Steele Hall in the propaganda for his Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign makes much of his claim to be more ‘progressive’ than the official Liberals with whom he has bitter personal quarrels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Hall  did his utmost, in the events leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia on 1 7 September last, to remove  Mr Millhouse  from his seat of Mitcham. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation has changed dramatically since the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the <span class="highlight">election</span> the then Leader of the Opposition said as honourable senators know very well, that he did not lose the <span class="highlight">election</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From then on, week after weary week, he threatened Australia with yet another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt, he will support  Mr Fraser  if  Mr Fraser  brings about that divisive action of going to the people for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the people in the electorate of Hawker will be very grateful that I have reminded them of all the disputes between  Senator Hall  and the members of the Government party for which he now seeks to be elected, whenever the <span class="highlight">election</span> may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not sat on any other side in this House, and in proof of the direction of politics I then followed I draw to  Senator McLaren’s  attention the fact that the Liberal Movement, now out of existence, on every occasion on which an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held, State or Federal, directed its first preferences to the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fourth point on which I was seriously misunderstood and misrepresented concerns the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Mr Millhouse  for the State electorate of Mitcham at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that elections in organisations be conducted in a manner which will achieve the fullest possible participation by members and be free of practices likely to lead to irregularities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the existing requirements for secret postal ballots, an organisation which does not have rules providing for a ‘secret postal ballot’ as defined must conduct the <span class="highlight">election</span> in accordance with the Conciliation and Arbitration regulations unless an exemption is granted by the Industrial Registrar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These regulations provide a comprehensive code of practice for the conduct of elections to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendments I am proposing will deem the regulations to be the rules of organisations in relation to the elections required to be conducted by ‘secret postal ballot’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regulations will not, however, apply to elections which the Industrial Registrar has exempted from the secret postal ballot requirement as already provided for in existing legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To reinforce these provisions, it will be open to the Federal Court, in proceedings under section 141 of 171c of the Act, to declare void an <span class="highlight">election</span> not conducted in accordance with the secret postal ballots regulations, and direct that a fresh <span class="highlight">election</span> be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make it even worse, the direct responsibility for implementation of these recommendations must surely rest first with the Minister for Police and the Commissioner for Police in Western Australia, with the State Government of that State, but we saw those aggravations continue right into the recent State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when five Perth lawyers went into the electorate of Kimberley with the direct responsibility of blocking an Aboriginal candidate from becoming a member of the House of Assembly in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister: Did not the present Prime Ministerthe then caretaker Prime Minister- in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1975 give an unequivocal undertaking that his Government would maintain full wage indexation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will have to face up to it’, he is reported to have said; and that in future the Government will be prepared to govern with courage if it has an <span class="highlight">election</span>, that is, if this issue can be used to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say that the Government will have to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> in order that it might be able to govern with courage and to stand up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One might ask the question: What happens, in  Mr Anthony’s  view, if an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held and there is the unfortunate circumstance that the Government is returned but is returned with a greatly reduced majority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could you explain to us as simply as you can how an <span class="highlight">election</span> a year ahead of time is going to help curb industrial unrest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I didn’t know there was going to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> a year ahead of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Society will have benefited if they realise that the course upon which they now embark because they seek an <span class="highlight">election</span> is quite unworkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government knows that but to divert the public’s attention it will have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> is certain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know that certain arrangements are being made within the Government parties which indicate that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is on the go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is there to be an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> is going to be against the union movement as though by some stroke, by some legislation, the Government will cure the troubles in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The measures it contains give effect to the Government parties’ industrial relations policy which was overwhelmingly endorsed at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That policy was enunciated in our policy speech delivered at the previous general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Government in its general <span class="highlight">election</span> speech did flag its intentions to introduce this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This second reading speech contains a major instalment of what was said in the general <span class="highlight">election</span> speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things, I referred to the imminent announcement of a general <span class="highlight">election</span> this side of Christmas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill, as I see it, is nothing more nor less than a continuation of a scenario that was commenced some two years ago to attempt to justify the need for a general <span class="highlight">election</span> before time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not the elected leaders, however the <span class="highlight">election</span> may be made; certainly not the elected leaders in relation to the strike in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition said: ‘No, it is a bad thing because it will take away from us one of the weapons we use at <span class="highlight">election</span> time to stir up industrial strife and to convince the Australian people that these are issues they should be looking at’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is a cheap political gimmick to hide the real economic conditions of this country and to give this Government what it thinks will be an easy ride into an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once again he referred to indexation and suggested that the Government had dishonoured an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise referable to indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indexation, as it was promoted in days prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of December 1975, referred not to a mere statistical, mechanical exercise of adjusting wages exactly to movements in the consumer price index every time there was a move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the legislation before us is the introduction of the final chapter of the industrial relations policy of the Government parties prior to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore  Mr Fraser  and his cohorts have sought in every possible way to manufacture some issue upon which to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was fascinated to see that the spearhead of the Australian Labor Party campaign for an <span class="highlight">election</span>, which evidently it does not want before Christmas, and the people it would promote the most would be  Mr Hawke  and  Mr Dunstan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remember the great <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1963 which dealt with the 36 faceless men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This leads to the question: Why does the Government want an <span class="highlight">election</span> this year when already it has a huge majority in both Houses, a majority of 51 in the House of Representatives and a majority of at least eight in this chamber? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that this Government knows that unemployment will reach 8 per cent of the work force early in the new year and that if it goes to an <span class="highlight">election</span> when unemployment is at 8 per cent it will be thrown out of office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look back at what occurred in 1928, we find that not only did the Bruce Government lose the <span class="highlight">election</span> as a result of its industrial relations policy but, in fact, the Prime Minister himself lost his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which our selection board was denigrated and reduced in status by the attack made upon it for political purposes will be to the everlasting disgrace of every individual member on the other side of this chamber, not only in respect of  Blue Poles  but also in respect of their attitude towards the improvement and expansion of the art collection of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is quite happy to see its supporters having their few bob each way and their Tooths or Courage or whatever it might be, continuing with the daily grind, the common task, and turning up on <span class="highlight">election</span> day, fearing the $2 fine if they do not turn up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He first put forward the plan as shadow Minister for Labor (in the days when we still could use the word), and reiterated it firmly as Leader of the Opposition: and it was one of the very few direct promises he made in his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign speeches in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That illustrates in the clearest possible way how the situation in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria has been manipulated for the purpose of calling an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators opposite will get their desserts in the right proportion whenever the <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yesterday, the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  said that sooner or later the Government must face up to the industrial situation and have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there is no doubt that the Government will use the wave of national outrage caused by the strike to launch a campaign for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And at this stage it will win such an <span class="highlight">election</span> because Australians have had their fill of strikes and union leaders . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771025_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister may remember that a few months ago I asked whether he would consider asking his Department to issue up-to-date photos of members of parliament for the Press, and for use in <span class="highlight">election</span> brochures, because if one makes a quick survey of the daily newspapers one sees that many photos of politicians show that politicians are ageless; indeed, unlike old soldiers they do not even fade away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I therefore ask, in view ofthe recent talk of elections: Will the Minister consider altering the  Electioral  Act so that photos of politicians on <span class="highlight">election</span> brochures, which may soon fall like confetti from the sky into letter boxes across Australia, would be required to have the year in which the photo was taken printed across the chest, somewhat as a convict has a number across his chest, which I am sure some people would feel was quite appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for the photographs that members of parliament use for electioneering, I am still waiting to see someone photographed on a bear skin and sucking his dummy! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there are some who are perhaps like Dorian Gray, in that they change not from <span class="highlight">election</span> to <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Robertson asks: ‘What about simultaneous elections?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I recall the matter, the Prime Minister in answering a question in the House of Representatives the other day reminded  Mr Whitlam  that he had said some months ago that there ought to be a twin <span class="highlight">election</span> this December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not know why  Mr Whitlam  has been running around like a headless chook for the last fortnight talking about the possibility of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can the Minister now inform the Parliament whether the purpose of the visits was to apply pressure to the Governor-General in order to ensure that he, in turn, would refuse permission for the dissolution of the Parliament and thus eliminate any possibility of a general <span class="highlight">election</span> this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The serious economic uncertainty caused by the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, in the opinion ofthe Senate, the following is a matter of urgency: the serious economic uncertainty caused by the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In moving this motion the Opposition wants to place on record its concern at the continuing debate- there is a lack of debate in some areasabout the <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring that has characterised parliamentary life since the beginning of the spring session of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one could say that we are in a period of stability, that there is any long term planning by this Government or that there is any justification for a fourth <span class="highlight">election</span> in five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole thrust of the <span class="highlight">election</span> policies put forward by the Liberal and National Country Parties was to that effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was some chance that this hiccup type of recovery may have developed into a substantial trend if the Government had adopted Labor’s recommendations for economic recovery and, more importantly, the Prime Minister had decided to end the rampant speculation about the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What sort of parliamentary process is it that enables this one man to determine whether or not we shall have an <span class="highlight">election</span>, whether or not we shall have a settling down period in the Australian economy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pertinent to look at a number of these, because almost no one in the Australian community is supporting the holding of an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exploiting a speculative political advantage is not a sufficient excuse to justify the cost in money and disruption of Government functions and of business activity which another <span class="highlight">election</span> now would entail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Election</span> jitters are a damaging distraction to the country and  Mr Fraser  and his Cabinet colleagues- by their hints and evasions- are doing as much as anyone to fan the rumours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To suggest that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is necessary when a government’s moves are challenged by significant elements in the community is either the refuge of weak and uncertain leadership or the desperation of <span class="highlight">election</span> mania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The electorate is treated to Ministers wandering around like rag and bone men scouring for <span class="highlight">election</span> finds, their perceptions and decisions warped by electioneering necessities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had an extended period of pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> jitters, which cannot be totally unrelated to the fact that the capital account of the balance of payments has remained weak despite the shoring up program of foreign borrowing and standby facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the economy is picking up, why have a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one reads the second manifestation of this so-called urgency motion one sees that it really talks about three things- economic uncertainty, <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second subject is the so-called <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have been saying that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is on and then saying that one is not on and doing that sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having been involved in some of the areas of so-called <span class="highlight">election</span> decisions, I say that this speculation is a complete load of nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third proposition is that the so-called <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring and uncertainty is all due to the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They combined to say to the Labor Government of 1974: ‘If you do not hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> we will not give you Supply.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we had an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We held an <span class="highlight">election</span> and we won it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For three months we were shilly-shallying about Supply in this place and for three months afterwards we were looking closely at <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only now but also for some months past, since the Budget was introduced in August, the Government has been floating out rumours and comments that an <span class="highlight">election</span> might be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recently saw a television program in the week Parliament was not sitting, about four or five weeks ago, and I saw a Tasmanian member of the House of Representatives- I am not quite sure of his name-urging the government not to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw that the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Goodluck)  had made statements in the Press that the time was not right for the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I assure the Minister for Industry and Commerce that these rumours that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is in the air are not merely a figment of the imagination of members of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears it is setting the stage for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There have been other snippets of bait going out to set the stage for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This spiel of <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and promised policy relaxations that we have seen in the past few weeks are rather cynical if not hypocritical in view of the existing backlog of broken or unfulfilled promises which have been made by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its electioneering activities I suggest became abundantly clear, as I have already mentioned, with the announcement of its August Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That decision was taken in the hope of winning popular appeal should an early <span class="highlight">election</span> be called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of this preoccupation with an early <span class="highlight">election</span>, as I have indicated, the Government seemed to decide to forgo much needed stimulatory increase in public sector spending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring overpowered any concern it may have had with the rising levels of unemployment in this country; so much so that today, in this year of 1 977, we have the greatest number of people out of work in Australia since the Great Depression of 1932. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason the Government is postulating an <span class="highlight">election</span> now is that it knows it will not be able to face the Australian public at large when the unemployment rate exceeds that staggering number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, perhaps the most blatant example of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring was a recent meeting between State Premiers and the Federal Government about which the  Age  of 22 October delightfully commented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the uncertainty created by this Government as to whether an <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held, business is uncertain and there is serious economic uncertainty caused by the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The urgency motion originally proposed accused the Government of dishonouring a number of <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and it was substantially in the same form as a motion debated yesterday by the other House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, one would have thought that Opposition members in this place today and in the other place yesterday would have regarded a debate of this nature as a golden opportunity to put forward positive policies that presumably they propose to put to the Australian people at the next federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, whenever that might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Senator Cotton)  listed two areas of alleged contention, namely economic uncertainty, which I submit to the Senate is the meat ofthe motion, <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, let me deal with the <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring and the Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that there has been endless speculation both in the media and by members of the Opposition about when there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that there has to be a half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that because I am up for re-<span class="highlight">election</span> before the end of June next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the essential qualities of an able and prudent Prime Minister is the ability not to telegraph his punches, particularly in respect of when an <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that members of the Opposition and certain sections of the media are upset that the Prime Minister has not indicated the date of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Prime Minister is under no obligation to say any more than he has said to this stage about when an <span class="highlight">election</span> might be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I leave the subject, I might point out that if any <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring has taken place it has been entirely due to Opposition and media speculation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tax cuts were at the forefront of our <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The present Government said during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that it would reduce the tax burden and put an end to Labor’s tax rip-off. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the serious economic uncertainty caused by the <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring ofthe Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason  Mr Fraser  wants an early <span class="highlight">election</span> is that he feels he can get himself another three years by going now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is in the light of that comment that the subject of this debate- the speculation about an early <span class="highlight">election</span> and the effects of that speculation on the Australian economy- is raised by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of climate amongst businessmen at the moment and it is not improved by speculation about an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it does confirm the view which the Opposition has put that the reason an <span class="highlight">election</span> might be sought by the Government is that the problems to which I have referred are likely to be much worse next year than they are this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister is on record as saying that continued speculation about an <span class="highlight">election</span> is damaging to the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 28 September this year when speaking in Brisbane, the Prime Minister said that continuous speculation about an <span class="highlight">election</span> is damaging to business confidence and to the economy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, there is a lot of cynicism about that comment coming from the Prime Minister because there are various views about the source of <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation and one source which is quite widely pointed to is the Prime Minister’s office itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This sort of speculation is consistent with the number of elections we have had in Australia in the past five years and the methods by which other elections in the past five years have been brought about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held this year, it will mean that we have had national elections four time in five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three of those elections have been brought about prematurely by the coalition parties behaving in a manner not dissimilar from the manner in which the Prime Minister is now behaving. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that the first of those elections was in May 1974 when the Senate threatened to reject Supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the word of  Senator Withers,  another authority in these matters, that that <span class="highlight">election</span> had been planned since the Labor Government came to office in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From December 1972 until May 1974 plans were in progress to subvert the normal procedure for holding elections in Australia to bring about an <span class="highlight">election</span> prematurely in a way - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the May 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> and his part in that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will remember the way in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was subsequently brought about in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numbers in the Senate were used ultimately to bring about an artificial and premature <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The coalition Government has an interesting track record in relation to the forcing of elections prematurely at great cost not only in terms of the cost of those actual elections but also in terms of the cost to the interruption of ordinary life in this country and particularly interruption to the economic life of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The facts are that in 1974 some five months of governing was lost through the period of the Labor Government as the result of that <span class="highlight">election</span> which was brought about precipitately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975 another period of some three to four months was lost because of the conduct of the then Opposition and the way in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was forced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, it looks as though the people of Australia are to be the subject of speculation and probably an <span class="highlight">election</span> which will cause the interruption to economic management which I have indicated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand the Prime Minister says that <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation is damaging to business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the  Deputy  Prime Minister has said that <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation is a good sort of thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He states that perhaps the Government does not have the courage to govern now with the biggest majority in the parliamentary history of this country but if we have an <span class="highlight">election</span> somehow it may get that courage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of that sort of speculation will lead the average Australian elector to scratch his head and say: ‘If they cannot govern now with a record majority for God ‘s sake what will they be like if we have an <span class="highlight">election</span> and the majority is reduced? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred to the  Financial Review  editorial which pointed out that the speculation about an <span class="highlight">election</span> was not a question about speculation of policies which this country so desperately needs in the manpower area, in the industry area and in the industrial relations area, as Government spokesmen tell us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The heading to the editorial was: ‘Economy the first <span class="highlight">election</span> casualty’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much of the damage to domestic and international confidence could have been minimised by a short, sharp <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But instead we have had an extended period of pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> jitters, which cannot be totally unrelated to the fact that the capital account of the balance of payments has remained weak despite the shoring up program of foreign borrowings and stand-by facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion mentions both economic uncertainty and <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not economic uncertainty, we had better look at the <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There had to be a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> before May 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There had to be a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of 1978 or in early 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The referendum held in Australia showed that voters wanted simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They included  Senator Douglas  McClelland who spoke a lot about when the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was shown that concurrence of the elections is preferred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elections have to be held by May of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To make the elections coincide they will have to be held within the next few months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who is doing the <span class="highlight">election</span> manoeuvring? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first person I heard speculating on when the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held was  Mr E.  G. Whitlam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon reviewing the record further, I find that when he was Prime Minister he had two opportunities, one in 1974 and one in 1975, to call for elections, but that his track record on those two occasions was not terribly impressive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really wonder why he feels that he would be any more competent to call an <span class="highlight">election</span> when we are in government than he was when he himself was in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is certainly not the Prime Minister who has been talking about an <span class="highlight">election</span>, nor has it been the Government in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator or the Government really believed that, we could expect that there would be no <span class="highlight">election</span> this year, because recent polls have shown that an <span class="highlight">election</span>, if conducted now, could be won by either side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the same technique used against  Mr Snedden  in 1 975 over the blocking of the Budget; in late 1975 in regard to a change of mind falsely attributed just a few months ago to  Mr Justice  Fox concerning the export of Australian uranium; and finally, of course, the speculation, which the Prime Minister has over the last four months fed, about a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that speculation, of course, he has been supported by his  deputy, Mr Anthony,  who before the National Country Party Council some two or three weeks ago castigated the Australian Labor Party for allegedly circulating or initiating rumours about a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>, stating how damaging it was that the dastardly Labor Party had so acted and adding that it would be quite unreasonable to expect the Prime Minister to refute the rumours and make an unequivocal assertion that there would not be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not take it up and the reason why he quite properly did not, according to the ludicrous logic for which the Australian Country Party has become famous as demonstrated by its present leader, was that, if the Prime Minister said there was not going to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> earlier than 12 months hence he would lose the last method available to him for controlling the irresponsible, militant left-wing unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what way the threat of a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> would influence union behaviour  Mr Anthony  did not explain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Anthony  tacitly admitted that the Government would not be able to win an <span class="highlight">election</span> six months hence; thus the reference to the six months of life remaining to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that commendable, although unconscious clarity and honesty- which he has displayed on previous occasions-  Mr Anthony  admitted that the reason why the speculation about a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> was initiated by the Prime Minister and himself, and why it has been fuelled by both those gentlemen ever since, is that they fear that the electors will by next year be fully conscious of the magnitude of this Government’s economic mismanagement and the horrendous level of unemployment which will by the early months of 1 978, be staring us in the face. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This stunt was pulled on by the Prime Minister and the Western galah in order to boost the chances of the Liberal Party in the <span class="highlight">election</span> that it plans to pull on prematurely on 10 December- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all coherently tied in, in a sense, that it is designed to induce and to build-up an expectation or to engineer a sense of phoney crisis for a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> and false expectations about the economic performance in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What could be more demoralising than the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam),  as he then was, having breakfast with dubious charactersand he was spurned by his own party for that action- trying to raise <span class="highlight">election</span> funds before the 1975 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As my leader said in this chamber today, how peculiar it is that  Mr Dunstan  and  Mr Hawke  will be the chief actors in the television series to promote the Labor Party at this supposed Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What greater uncertainty could there be in this community, when one surveys the political scene, than trying to guess who would be the Prime Minister of Australia in the unlikely event that Labor was elected at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Of course he could not when even his spokesman in that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, as  Senator Young  has indicated, may be in the running. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even  Senator Gietzelt  who inadequately moved this motion on behalf of the Australian Labor Party said that the choice in relation to any prospective <span class="highlight">election</span> was properly between May and December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not talking about a separation of a year or  1 8  months between some prospective and improper- by Labor Party definition- date for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to whether the <span class="highlight">election</span> will be in December or six months later, I say to the Labor Party that the only uncertainty and concern which the business community and private individuals who are involved in the situation have is whether Labor will be defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of those words which I have read to the Senate, the great fear in the Australian community is not the fear of an <span class="highlight">election</span>; it is, what I believe is a quite unjustified fear, that Labor might have some chance of winning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as an <span class="highlight">election</span> is held, whether it be December or May, and the Labor Party is again defeated with the Liberals victorious, there will be no uncertainty in the community because the <span class="highlight">election</span> itself will remove that fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was rather disturbed though by the South Australian Premier’s undertaking during the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in South Australia to provide filtered water for metropolitan Adelaide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to inform the Senate that the Government has recommended to His Excellency the Governor-General that the House of Representatives be dissolved on 10 November next and that a general <span class="highlight">election</span> for the members of the House of Representatives be held on Saturday, 10 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If their places are to be filled by 1 July 1978, an <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill them must be held no later than May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the second paragraph of section 13 of the Constitution an <span class="highlight">election</span> to fill vacant Senate places may be held within one year before the places become vacant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the general practice prior to 1963 to hold elections for the House of Representatives and for half the Senate on the same date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in 1955, the GovernorGeneral,  Sir William  Slim, on the advice of the then Prime Minister, dissolved the House of Representatives much earlier than its three-year term to synchronise the elections for the two Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case, the <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses was held some 18 months after the previous <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In May this year, the Government put to the people a referendum proposal which was intended to ensure that elections for both Houses would have to be held simultaneously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the view of the Government that at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate, an <span class="highlight">election</span> should also be held for the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, in a  Monday Conference  interview on 1 November 1976, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  thought it would be entirely appropriate to have a combined half-Senate and House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> at the end of 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a year’s time, which I would think would be about the earliest that there could be an <span class="highlight">election</span>, although quite a likely time for the <span class="highlight">election</span>, it would be a perfectly reasonable time to have a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and one could have the whole of the House of Representatives at the same time to synchronise the elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the elections are not held together it will mean that there must be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate at least by May 1978, an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the House of Representatives before April 1979, another <span class="highlight">election</span> for half the Senate before July 1 98 1 and so on- a major Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> every one or two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A situation in which a Government is constantly concerned with the holding of elections is not conducive to sound government and hence is not in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me also make clear that an <span class="highlight">election</span> in December would be in keeping with the pattern over many years for elections to be held for half the Senate in the latter months of the calendar year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, December would be the usual time for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> to take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since 1949, and leaving aside double dissolutions, elections for half the Senate have been held in November or December on seven occasions and in May on one occasion only. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, acting on behalf of the Prime Minister, came into, the chamber and said: ‘We are now going to end the speculation and stop the economic uncertainty caused by that speculation by announcing the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> as 10 December’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since August last when the Prime Minister told the editor of the  Australian  newspaper that he might spring an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Australian economy and political system have been subjected to very great stresses, strains and uncertainties deliberately created by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In early September, when the Prime Minister was engaged in a pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Queensland, he admitted that speculation on an <span class="highlight">election</span> date was creating uncertainty and confusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is is fair to say that as a result of the Government’s antics there have been as many bets placed on an early <span class="highlight">election</span> and on the date for an <span class="highlight">election</span> as have been placed on the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The redistribution proposals have not been approved by Parliament and yet, before those proposals have been dealt with by Parliament, the Prime Minister is announcing the date for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite all the semantics connected with the statement made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate on behalf of the Prime Minister, the simple and clear fact is that the Government is hoping that by holding an <span class="highlight">election</span> at this time it might escape the wrath of the Australian community when the number of unemployed persons soars to over 420,000 early in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Prime Minister has been fiddling and hesitating in his typical fashion about an <span class="highlight">election</span> date, the Labor Party has been preparing to fight and we will challenge the competence of this Government before the people of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will fight the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the basis of the hesitancy, uncertainty and turmoil that the Government has created. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will fight the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue of the unemployment the Government has already created and will continue to create. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will fight the <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue of the Government’s interference with the great Medibank scheme that was introduced by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So far as simultaneous elections are concerned, senators who are elected in December will not take their places in the Senate until July, 7 months later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister really wanted to synchronise elections for both Houses, as has been said by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, if things are on the up and up, as has been said by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the time for an <span class="highlight">election</span> on both counts surely would have been May of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will be the fourth House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held in 5 years and the public is well and truly fed up with the political uncertainty that the coalition parties have been creating in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> date having been announced, the Labor Party is ready and when the new Parliament is assembled a Labor Government will be installed in office with a majority in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen that if the vote for the Labor Party in 1972 were to be again the vote for it in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> the Labor Party would win 10 of the 19 seats, which would not be an unreasonable result in the circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if the vote at the confused <span class="highlight">election</span> that occurred in 1975 were repeated in 1977 the Labor Party would win only one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So by the unnecessary inclusion of those three shires in the Federal division of Kalgoorlie the Liberal Party, which currently holds the seat, has gained in net terms in excess of 1,000 votes which could well be enough to enable the Liberal Party to retain the seat at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that something like 1,400 enrolled prior to the last State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of those changes the seat of Perth, which almost certainly would have been returned to the Australian Labor Party at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>, has now become a highly marginal seat and could be retained by the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of that challenge and in view of the challenge, which has been heard by the court but upon which judgment has not been delivered, as to the right of the Territories to return members to the House of Representatives or to the Senate, and in view of the fact that redistributions are required, according to an existing judgment of the High Court which precludes any <span class="highlight">election</span> being held on the old boundaries in at least five States, and presumably would permit an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large, it is astonishing, to say the least, that the GovernorGeneral should have granted permission for the dissolution of Parliament, particularly when his action blatantly contradicts his own statement in New Delhi in February 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that I was a little concerned when it was first issued because until the Labor Party endorsed its candidates I thought that it might succeed in winning a seat from the Liberal Party in the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can understand the transfer of a major subdivision, but some of these things have convinced me very much of the testimony of  Senator Baume  about having a look at the matter in the context of the 1969 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I put it to the Opposition that, should this motion fail, on 10 December there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also put this to honourable senators: There is no law in force at the moment which would govern the conduct of an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that at that time I gave the honourable senator some answers relating to my capacity under, I think, section 24 of the Act to issue regulations to conduct an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does one conduct an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large when we have no laws in relation to that contingency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have had it put to me that if that happened the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be conducted under the rules which existed in New South Wales some time in March 1901. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some hurried legislation were passed through the Parliamentthat is the only alternative to accepting this redistributionI think there would be general agreement that should there be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large it would be basically along the same lines as the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, that is, proportional representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I put to the Opposition that the only logical conclusion I can come to is that the alternative is a Senate type <span class="highlight">election</span> for the 43 New South Wales seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is fair to say that we would have four times that many for a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I very much doubt whether this Government will be in a position to introduce legislation in respect of any matters which affect primary producers at this time next year because after the general <span class="highlight">election</span> is held on 10 December its supporters will be sitting on the other side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771027_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is getting near <span class="highlight">election</span> time and, in the main, the farmer organisations are being very critical of the Labor Government and the trade union movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, the Cattlemen’s Union and the Fruitgrowers Association, following the big marches in Mooroopna, Victoria, and Berri, South Australia, said that the Government  is not living up to its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to look after people in the country areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We will have to suffer statements, similar to those which have been made by honourable senators on the Government side, week in week out until the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I well remember when I was a boy that Stanley Bruce, a conservative Prime Minister, took the trade union movement on and lost his seat at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the very words which I used: The people in country areas will have no difficulty arriving at their choice when they compare the record of the Whitlam Government in its three years in office-a period interrupted by an <span class="highlight">election</span> which was forced upon us- with the record of the Liberal-Country Party coalition in the last two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I know that there was a recommendation that a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders be held, I think, either this week or next week; but, because of events which have overtaken the calling of that meeting, doubtless no meeting of the Committee will take place between now and the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say with great respect to every honourable senator that, if we believe in the institution of Parliament, if we believe in the system of parliamentary democracy, if we believe in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of people’s representatives to the Parliament, we have to devise and evolve a system whereby as much as possible of the deliberations in this place is recorded and transmitted to the public at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last week the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  gave further proof of this statement when he announced the calling of a House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> a full year before it in fact was required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Douglas McClelland referred in passing to the early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I thought it seemed strange for an opposition to complain about the holding of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the three years that we were in opposition I asked once a week for an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An opposition that is confident that it is going to win an <span class="highlight">election</span> will want that <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held so that it can do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that an opposition that complains about the holding of an early <span class="highlight">election</span> knows that it is going to be beaten. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that a really good fighting opposition does not complain about the holding of an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am just saying that I am surprised that the Opposition does not want an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of that Department, funds were set aside for the cost of running elections and, if one looks back now at those estimates, one sees that probably not enough money was set aside for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the points I want to raise is that no funds at all were made available for investigating electoral reform, and we are about to go into an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign with a system of running elections, especially for this chamber, that I believe is in the greatest need of reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1975 it took two months to get the final result of the double dissolution <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking a situation such as the one that occurred in the 1961 <span class="highlight">election</span>, when the Government finished up with only a one seat majority, in 1975 the country could have been placed in a situation in which for a period of two months nobody would have known who the Government was going to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough when one compares it with the situation in the United States, which has a presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 600-odd seats in the House of Commons and sometimes two or three complete recounts, yet it is usually only 48 to 72 hours before the full <span class="highlight">election</span> result is known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When faced with a situation such as that which occurred in New South Wales in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, where in the first count there was a difference of only 19 votes per electorate for the 45 electorates, it is apparent that the system of random sampling also needs investigating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think also that the Department of Administrative Services should be looking at ways of reducing possible corruption in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign by looking at the public funding of candidates and campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United States at the last presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> there was public funding for the first time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that in time this aspect will spread to all the Congressional and Senate elections which are held in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The events leading up to and subsequent to the Lords rejection of the Finance Bill in 1909, culminating in the General <span class="highlight">Election</span> of January 1910 and the subsequent passing of the 1909 Bill are well enough known to be not dealt with here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I simply make this observation: Last week when we were dealing with the redistribution of electorates  Senator Withers  drew a very vivid picture of what would happen if we were to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say respectfully from the previous experience of more than 50 candidates standing for a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in one State, that unless we can guarantee that there will be fluorescent lighting in every polling booth we will find the frequency of errors rising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer Has his attention been drawn to the rise of 6.6 per cent on the Sydney Stock Exchange yesterday, one of the strongest rises for years, which was attributed to the falling of official interest rates and the prospect of a Government win at next month’s <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take it that he and all his colleagues will campaign before the next <span class="highlight">election</span> saying that they are totally opposed to fuel price equalisation in Australia as they are opposed to the superphosphate bounty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind that over the next few weeks leading up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> these people will be doing quite a lot of extra work and also that their salaries have not kept pace with those of their counterparts in the States, can the Minister say whether senators’ and members’ staff can be recompensed by the payment of overtime during this period? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the puerile efforts of this Government to try to denigrate  Mr Bill  Hayden, does the Minister recall that in a television debate between  Mr Hayden  and  Mr Lynch  prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> it was agreed all around the country and especially by the media that  Mr Lynch  came out second rate at best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He thought he would not be able to survive another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This question has a sense of urgency about it because of the impending <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Negus: Do you see that this sort of thing, Whitlam and Hayden and together is going to be something well see for the rest of the year with an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to Labor today that it must clear up this position before it can begin to have a coherent debate about the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May I say that he has every reason to be worried because at the last State  <span class="highlight">election</span> I think that there was about seven or eight per cent difference between us in the vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the rate of increase in votes for our Party at each <span class="highlight">election</span> I expect that  Senator Young’s  Party will some day be in the minority position in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My main reason for speaking on this Bill was to draw attention once again to the audacity of the Prime Minister when he pulled this premature <span class="highlight">election</span> in claiming that it was necessary to have an <span class="highlight">election</span> to remove the instability which had been generated by constant talk of a premature <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s posturing about an early <span class="highlight">election</span>, his attempt to justify his action, his cynical political opportunism, on the ground that it was necessary to remove the uncertainty that he himself had generated, is precisely comparable with the actions of the legendary double murderer who was guilty of both patricide and matricide and threw himself on the mercy of the court because he was an orphan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time the unemployment forecast was outlandish, as was shown by the slight fall in unemployment immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At one stage during the 197S <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign,  Mr Fraser  said that in two years Australia would spend $6,500m more than we have- over $500 for every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser,  having pulled this premature <span class="highlight">election</span> because he knows very well that the economy is sliding rapidly further Unto recession, pretends that the Government is optimistic, that the economic depression has bottomed and that we are rapidly moving into an era of new prosperity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Prime Minister really believed that the economy was recovering we would be having an <span class="highlight">election</span> next year and not this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Prime Minister is getting in to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> early hoping that he can fool the electorate before the people become fully conscious of the economic disaster into which he and his policies have led the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also interesting to reflect that the Governor-General, who granted this <span class="highlight">election</span>, said in February 1975, that the only justification for granting a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> would be that the Parliament was unworkable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He explicitly stated that an <span class="highlight">election</span> should not be granted just because the Prime Minister of the day found it convenient to hold it prematurely at that particular time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said in my speech last week on the Oilseeds Levy Collection and Research Bill 1977,  Senator Hall  has come to light and emerged from hibernation now only because he is seeking re-<span class="highlight">election</span> as a Liberal member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we apply the voting figures for the State <span class="highlight">election</span> on 17 March to the boundaries of Hawker, we will see that  Mr Hall,  as he will be when he contests that seat, is in for a rude shock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My esteemed friend,  Senator Donald  Cameron, soon ousted him the first time he had to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was appointed and then six months later, I think, when he went on the hustings at a by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, my great friend,  Senator Donald  Cameron, gave him a whacking of a hiding at the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will he explain his statements of that time to the people he wants to vote for him at the coming <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happened after the 1975 elections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is now on the political stump trying to woo the people in Hawker to vote for him at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will again be the incumbent of the seat after the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that  Senator Young  will not be remiss during the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to remind the electors of Hawker just what type of person he thought  Senator Hall  was when he made those remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that he will not be asking  Senator Withers  to introduce him on the platform when he opens his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Hawker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He still has a grouch against the Country Party; yet he will be campaigning in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> in an endeavour to come back to this Parliament as a member of a coalition government in which the Country Party will be propping up the Liberal Party-that is, if the coalition parties return to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Withers  told us here again today, every day they were in opposition they were calling for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have forgotten- some insignificant bloke who had an <span class="highlight">election</span> 12 months early on a non-issue and lost, and wondered why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The form of the legislation will become known when the Bill is before the Senate, and all I want to say at this stage is that it is a worthwhile reform and is yet another <span class="highlight">election</span> promise which our Government has redeemed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was given the Premiership of South Australia and at the first <span class="highlight">election</span> he was defeated by Don Dunstan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> he scraped through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing that he would be defeated in the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> he scrapped his Party- sacrificed the loyalty of his comrades- and went back to the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>After the redistribution, all seats in South Australia which there was a possibility of Liberal success were strongly contested in the pre-selection of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals have contested the seat of Hawker at every <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party has given it on a plate to  Senator Hall  who is running a big <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been obvious since the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced that with the Liberals asking Dorothy Dix questions and the propaganda replies of the Leader of the Government  (Senator Withers)  in an attempt to discredit the Leader of the Labor Party uranium will be a major issue in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It wants to use it as an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue for the purpose of attracting votes in spite of the possible sacrifice of human life, the possibility of nuclear weapons proliferation and the possibility of terrorist control of nuclear material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is insufficient variation in the difference of opinion in the issue for the Government to win or lose the <span class="highlight">election</span> on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an issue that will take the place of the state of the economy and the unemployment situation in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just say that  Senator Hall  will be replied to every time he seeks to use this venue for the purpose of political propaganda for his campaign in relation to the seat of Hawker and the Government will be replied to on every occasion that it distorts the Labor Party’s attitude to uranium mining, which is the most commendable, the most desirable and the most consistent on uranium mining, for the purpose of gaining advantage in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that over the next three or four days that remain in the sittings before we rise for the <span class="highlight">election</span> they will keep up that effort and that the strength of the effort will simply mirror their own fears in relation to the seat of Hawker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to him that in view of his opposition to any form of racial discrimination, I hope he will use his good intentions with some of his colleagues in his State who trooped north during the last Western Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> to confuse the minds of so many Aborigines in the north of Western Australia over their rights to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three subjects referred to were the increase in the size of the Public Service, <span class="highlight">election</span> issues, and the Constitution and the granting of appropriations contained in money Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to deal with the very difficult question of what system of elections Australia should have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that all political parties when in power support the system of <span class="highlight">election</span> that most suits them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The party in power will support the <span class="highlight">election</span> system which it thinks will give it an advantage, whether that be the preferential voting system or optional preference voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as one can depend upon the party in power to favour the system of <span class="highlight">election</span> must suitable to it one can depend upon the opposition party to oppose the <span class="highlight">election</span> proposals of the party in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such a course were followed in Australia, it would solve immediately the long delays in <span class="highlight">election</span> counting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Supply Bills are not passed and this results in the inability of the government of the day to carry on with the funding of the Public Service, the only known solution under the interpretation of our authority is for the Governor-General to dismiss the government and to submit it to the people for re-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He argued that if this chamber opposed a money Bill and could not agree upon the matter there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> of both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a situation would arise so frequently that there would be more elections than occur presently. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government thereupon appointed two commissioners who were, I believe,  Mr Justice  Clarkson, Visiting Lecturer of the University of Western Australia and  Mr Bridge,  who is now disputing the <span class="highlight">election</span> results in the Kimberleys. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look at the figures when the rolls close for this coming <span class="highlight">election</span>, it will be seen that they are different from what the Commissioners brought down as their expectations as at 24 June. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will such a statement reconcile the Governor-General’s action with the view he expressed in New Delhi in February 1975, namely, that he had to have good and sound reasons for calling an early <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the institution is very dear to the hearts of honourable senators opposite because we have seen in recent years that a Liberal Party, with the aid of the Governor-General, can choose an <span class="highlight">election</span> at any time, whether the Liberal Party be in opposition or in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has never been defeated in the year and a half since the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and in those circumstances it is appropriate I believe, that you,  Mr Speaker,  should forthwith advise the GovernorGeneral waiting upon him forthwith to advise him- that the party I lead has the confidence of the House of Representatives, and you should appraise his  Excellency  of the view of the House that I have the confidence of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether or not people should be allowed to conduct their affairs via trusts under sections 98 and 99 of the existing legislation is something that was recognised by the Government in its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise back in 1975 that individual taxpayers would have the alternatives of paying taxation either as a company or opting to be taxed as partners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I applaud the Government’s decision which is right in line with statements of government policy made before the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I wonder whether the Minister believes that the blueprint, shall we call it, which the Minister visualises will be operational in the period leading up to the general <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can assure the honourable senator that between now and polling day the Australian Electoral Office will be doing all it can, taking into account, of course, that all the divisional returning officers naturally are terribly busy with the normal problems of running an <span class="highlight">election</span>, for example, employing some 10,000 people to work on polling day, hiring polling booths the problems of nominations, printing of ballot papers and distributing them around the electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand it, the way the Act reads at the moment it is more than likely that all the people who are standing for the next <span class="highlight">election</span> have committed a breach of the Electoral Act because they have bought somebody meat or drink 90 days before the issue of the writ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But who amongst us ever knows 90 days before the writ is issued that there will be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having no knowledge that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was coming one could have done something which the issue of the writ had made unlawful, and one could be prosecuted for attempting to influence voters by the supply of meat and drink <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Asked whether the situation would change if any other candidate won the <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  said: ‘You can read it that way if you like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ALP candidate in Mount Isa for the November 12 <span class="highlight">election</span> is  Mr A.  Pavusa whose party thinks he can beat  Mr Bertoni. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The very basis of democracy is threatened if we have the threat of reprimand hanging over us for the way in which we vote at an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition Leader  (Mr Burns)  today lodged a complaint with the Justice Minister  (Mr Lickiss)  concerning yesterday’s <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign statement in Mount Isa by the Premier  (Mr Bjelke-Petersen). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a clear example of political intimidation and blackmail aimed at denying Queenslanders their democratic right of <span class="highlight">election</span> choice ‘,  Mr Burns  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is distressing in this <span class="highlight">election</span> when the National-Liberal parties are prepared to resort to this type of fear on electors to conceal their own economic mismanagement’,  Mr Burns  said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does his proposed departure from the Prime Minister’s staff immediately prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> display a singular lack of confidence in the prospects of the Prime Minister? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that indicate APPM’s confidence that this Government will continue after the <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign pamphlet of 1968 he said to the South Australian electors that one of his aims was to build Chowilla Dam and safeguard Australia’s water supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly will take place before the end of 1978 and issues of future constitutional development for the Territory will be widely canvassed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Legislative Assembly in planning and development is a central aspect of this inquiry and will be an important consideration in the debate preceding that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would therefore emphasise this Committee’s view that the reappointment of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory after the <span class="highlight">election</span> and the referral of this matter to it again should be a matter of priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will be expected to be considered by all members of Parliament and debated and passed by both Houses of Parliament before the Parliament rises early next week for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only because of the immediacy of an <span class="highlight">election</span> that we do not oppose the Bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, a judgment of the High Court, known as the McKinlay case, was handed down in December 1975 at a time when a general <span class="highlight">election</span> was being held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At about that time there were suggestions in the air about the holding of an early <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Distribution Commissioners were said to be being put under pressure to hurry up their final proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be fair to say that the electoral laws of this nation are as uncertain as we were over the last three or four months about whether the Prime Minister would determine to hold an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, all of this last minute panic has been brought about because of the Government’s mad rush for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>, especially one so soon after a massive redistribution has been carried out by Distribution Commissioners- doubtless with assistance of officers of the Australian Electoral Office- and also because the Government has made a hash of its February amending Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one bears in mind the great, important and onerous responsibilities of the divisional returning officers at a Federal general <span class="highlight">election</span>, especially when a ballot is very tight- when a seat or even a government can be determined by a mere handful of votes- one can see that one needs a person whose pay is at a level in accord- .ance with the responsible position he is occupying. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I well recall that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> the seat of St George was determined by about 42 voters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As he said last week, if the boundaries are not approved the Government can provide for an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large and the Minister himself could write the rules for such an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how many members would make up the Opposition if the present Government and not an independent electoral officer wrote the rules on which an <span class="highlight">election</span> could be conducted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High Court could injunct the present redistribution or it could hear the matter and rule the existing redistribution to be invalid and then there could well be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had waited until May to hold the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> it would not have had to race around, causing terrible upheaval, because of the time limits imposed by that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Election</span> candidates, particularly senators who like to get nominations from a number of areas, will probably have to do what I am doing and risk a High Court challenge to the validity of their nomination because the rolls might not be available before the writs close. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation is intended to deal with an emergency situation which, as both  Senator Douglas  McClelland and  Senator Mulvihill  have said, arose out of the unnecessary haste required to get through a redistribution in time for a December <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition asked the Minister for Administrative Services  (Senator Withers)  about the time that the Commonwealth Electoral Officer would require following a redistribution to put his organisation into the sort of shape necessary to cope with an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those questions were asked as long ago as February of this year, and  Senator Withers  indicated that the nature of the timetable was such that it would lead to an <span class="highlight">election</span> early in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that even at that time  Senator Withers,  as the Minister responsible for the Department covering electoral officers, realised that it would take at least until early 1978 for the Chief Electoral Officer to complete the reorganisation necessary to carry out a very complex task, involving changing the rolls, setting up new polling places, all the paraphernalia that is necessary for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some time ago figures were given to me by an electoral officer in Queensland relating to a very tight <span class="highlight">election</span> contest that led to counting going on for about a fortnight afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not talking about a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> but about one of the House of Representatives elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electoral officers carry out the most important function in a democratic system in relation to the procedure for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Douglas  McClelland has said, if this legislation does not go through today there could be a successful approach to a court to prevent the <span class="highlight">election</span> taking place in New South Wales on the redistributed electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the redistribution were to be found to be in doubt and if some injunction were granted against it we would have an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am told that an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large would be held under rules brought down - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But accepting that the Minister is essentially a fair man he would find it very difficult to set up a rule for an <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales without being influenced by his politics and ideological philosophy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second part of that proposition appeals to me somewhat so honourable senators can understand that I could not be trusted either to draw up rules for an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming from this legislation there is a need for someone to anticipate the day when an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large has to be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible that even in our time there could be an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We go along with this legislation so that the <span class="highlight">election</span> which has been decided on can proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be no doubt that we would have some misgivings about an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large, and those misgivings ought to be removed by the Minister suggesting that he could antici- pate some future problem arising and he will ave his officers look at the situation now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suspect that recent events in politics, especially in Queensland and I suppose in the Federal sphere, because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is coming up, could goad members into taking a political stance on this BUI, but I do not intend to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that and the fact that this $24m is over and above the weighted entitlements which Queensland already receives, one reads with some surprise the things which are written in Queensland, which at the moment is subject to an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We as Australians are concerned about civil liberties and about the rights which people have in <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that an <span class="highlight">election</span> is being heldin Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that the members of the public voting in that <span class="highlight">election</span> do not want to jump out of the frying pan into the fire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope at the same time that the Queensland Government will recognise that we are making this assistance available as Australian citizens and that it will respect the rights of all Australian citizens during this <span class="highlight">election</span> period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to take part in this debate and to use the procedures of the Senate to air one or two matters that are concerning me gravely with respect to conduct in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am gravely concerned about certain events that have occurred during the State general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inevitably, because there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland in eight days time, the debate took the form of a State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have been actively engaged in the affairs of Parliament for a period of five straight weeks and we are about to become involved for a further week before we rise for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771104_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he seen reports that if the Australian Labor Party wins the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December it will reduce tariffs, inevitably leading to further unemployment in manufacturing? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will be delighted to prove it later on as the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign progresses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will these announcements have anything to do with the forthcoming general <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, with the impending general <span class="highlight">election</span>, the meeting needed to be held prior to the rising of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has also had raised with him the fact that the schedule of the team visits coincides with the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign; indeed, it is due to be finalised on the actual day of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Negotiations have been in progress since well before there was any suggestion of an <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland and the coincidence concerning the <span class="highlight">election</span> date could not have been foreseen by those who made the arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of the debate dealing with the economic uncertainty created by the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> speculation,  Senator Withers  interjected when I was speaking and he said that  Mr Whitlam  wants an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is one entitled to conclude that the report is an unfavourable one and that the Government is keeping it under wraps until this <span class="highlight">election</span> is over? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the circumstances were so urgent that a government wishing to take advantage of the best political climate at the time of an <span class="highlight">election</span> would have reacted to any favourable recommendation that the Industries Assistance Commission had made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unjust, cruel and unfair if, knowing that, we keep these people dangling on a string for another six or seven months and then at the end of that time, with the <span class="highlight">election</span> safely over, say to them: ‘We cannot expend any further Commonwealth funds on this operation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added to this lack of decision is the fact that the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> has necessitated the dropping of further consideration of this program until after 10 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that, should the Government survive the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>, it will attempt to send these back to the States, without the guarantees of continuous funding which the States will require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision then may, or may not, depend upon whether another <span class="highlight">election</span> is pending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s objection is not to the extension but to the fact that the extension is for only one year- that a sudden <span class="highlight">election</span> thrust upon the Government the need to extend the program for one year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be plenty of opportunity, over the next two days and perhaps during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, to point out the errors of the Government in its approach to the economic problems that the nation faces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I express the hope that the extension of the year is not considered necessary merely because we are about to have an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be that Labor will be successful in that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Again, it seems to demonstrate that the Government is not very anxious to find a solution to the problem of employed school leavers, except insofar as it wishes, for the purposes of the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>, to demonstrate a few token schemes which have absorbed just a few thousand of the unemployed youth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, when her leader brought on a hurried <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Government had to scamper around and bring in something that would appeal for votes, it sought to amend the Bill and afford provision over and above what the Budget had contemplated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not growling about that because, after the Greensborough by-<span class="highlight">election</span> on Saturday last, I am very happy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My understanding is that no such action seems likely, however, since at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in September this year the public imposed its own punishment by not returning the two members to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Mr Khemlani  is reported to have made telephone calls to Canberra, does the Minister believe that there is any possibility that he could be involved in planning the Australian Labor Party’s financial policy prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Treasurer, who was absent from Question Time in another place on 3 November, must frankly and promptly reveal the full nature and extent of his dealings in land on the Mornington Peninsula and, in particular, his financial relationships, personal and political, with  Mr Leake,  whose relations with Ministers in the Hamer Government in securing development permits and raising <span class="highlight">election</span> funds have been exposed before the inquiry in recent weeks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is listed in a Liberal Party <span class="highlight">election</span> pamphlet as one of the Fraser Government’s major achievements - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the Premier of Queensland says that Bonner is a political activist because he tells people to enrol and speaks on street corners during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign asking the people to vote for the Liberal Party, is the Premier going to ask the Federal Government to withdraw me from the Senate because I am a political activist? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not saying she was doing that for any other reason than to indicate that at the moment this country, and particularly Queensland, is in a delicate situation because of the two <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns that are taking place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has also had raised with him the fact that the schedule of the team visits coincides with the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign; indeed, it is due to be finalised on the actual day of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But nothing happens in relation to treatment of ill people in hospitals or in the field anywhere in Queensland or in Australia, even though the fact they may be dying or suffering from some grievous disability happens to coincide with the day of the State or Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Federal rolls will be open for a few days yet but I cannot imagine that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  would be worried about half a dozen enrolments in a Federal Division which he will lose anyway at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party has produced a pamphlet for the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and under the heading ‘Aboriginal Affairs’ the claim is made that the national trachoma campaign is one of the plus factors of the two years of Liberal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such a decision is postponed until after the December <span class="highlight">election</span>, Aborigines in the area, and in Queensland generally, will scatter far and wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said earlier this year that if a general <span class="highlight">election</span> were called before Christmas it would be only because the Prime Minister had lost his nerve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prime Minister is so sure that there are no political problems facing him, it will make no difference at all to hrs <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The votes in both the areas in which the teams will be operating will come back to the Labor Party at this <span class="highlight">election</span>, so it will not make one iota of difference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is occurring in Queensland is similar to the situation in Western Australia at the moment where, because an Aboriginal candidate was successful in an appeal to the tribunal, the Premier of that State has decided to motivate his Party to introduce legislation to prevent every nonliterate Aboriginal in the electoral seat of Kimberly, or in any other seat in Western Australia, from having the right to vote in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I defy any honourable senator or any member of the community to go into a polling booth in a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> such as we saw in New South Wales in 1975, when there were some 70-odd candidates, and not take his how to vote card with him so that he will know who to vote for in the ordinary sequence set out on the how to vote cards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The legislation represents the final move in the Government’s broadcasting policy before the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that Government senators understand this because it will be a significant issue in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are most concerned with the structural way in which licences are to be granted under the proposed legislation, and in the context of an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December I say quite frankly that the policy of the Australian Labor Party is one of separating these functions quite distinctly and taking them away from the Minister, as this Minister keeps saying that he intends to do but does not do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, it is these sorts of things that we will wrap around the necks of Government supporters in the course of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will approve of it, of course, because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on 10 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought that  Senator Wright,  who made a lot of noise just a moment ago, would have been concerned that the house of review is about to adopt legislation of this kind because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on 10 December and he has to be loyal to his Ministeror part time Minister as he is described- for Post and Telecommunications and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  who want this legislation passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not regard it as a Bill that ought to be considered in a party political or <span class="highlight">election</span> atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the general tone of the statement is of one that has been thrown together hurriedly because an <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held in about six weeks’ time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does this compare with the active community involvement in the Australian Assistance Plan which the Government, despite a firm <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, effectively torpedoed without any consultation with the States soon after coming into power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume the Government’s statement is in fact some sort of pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to make only a few comments on the Government’s statement, which took me by surprise and was obviously not so much a social welfare statement as one made in preparation for the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If she repeats it during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign one can imagine the multitudes lauding the good servant, the Government, which now cries over the poverty in Australia that it supposedly wants to alleviate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actions speak louder than words, and recent elections have shown that the Aboriginal people know what this Government is doing for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It shows the desperation of a Government that has pulled on an <span class="highlight">election</span> and is afraid of the results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it will be too late by then because the figures will come out on the eve of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In some years the pensioners would get nothing but if it was an <span class="highlight">election</span> year they would get ten shillings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our promise was that we would lift the pension to 25 per cent of the average wage and were very close to achieving it when we went out of office, despite the fact that we were continually frustrated in this chamber and had been forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> midway through our first term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least  Mr Court,  the West Australian Premier, will not be able to deprive illiterate Aborigines of the opportunity to vote in the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet immediately  Mr Court,  this Liberal Premier in Western Australia, was made aware of the fact that he presented a very weak case in the Court of Disputed Returns and that the court intended to order another <span class="highlight">election</span>, what did he do? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was hoping that the candidate who ran so close to his Minister in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Kimberleys would not have the benefit of the vote from the Aboriginals despite the fact that the Labor candidate is an Aboriginal himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we find being put down in this Parliament tonight on the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span> a document which tries to fool the people that the Government has some concern, in the first place, for people who are suffering poverty and, m the second place, for the Aboriginal people of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-48-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was more than interested to see that in the forthcoming general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign our opponents, as usual, will be devoting their time and attention to affairs of the past, whereas the present Government, led by a progressive Prime Minister, has progressive policies for the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, this action has prevented those people being eligible to vote at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is certainly not the fault of this Government that these people were unable to acquire Australian citizenship in time for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other than the fact that there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> on 10 December, what was the reason for the Government’s complete somersault on what appeared to be an irrevocable refusal? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister when announcing policies on the eve of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> said that a Liberal government would find work for all who wanted work? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The arguments concerning education have during the last 12 months or so been canvassed widely in the Parliament and no doubt will be again during the course of the coming <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every educationist and every parent in Australia should realise that what they have had over the past two years is only a taste of what they will get in the succeeding three years if the present Government happens to be in power after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was somewhat surprised to read of the debate that took place in the other place because when my colleague  Mr Scholes  moved the amendment which I am suggesting should be considered by the Senate today, he was berated by the Tasmanian members, all of whom are up for <span class="highlight">election</span> and, therefore, whom one would have expected to have shown a bit more interest in the problems facing the apple and pear industry in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has turned its back on that and we find Tasmanian members of the House of Representatives, who are all up for <span class="highlight">election</span> and whom one would expect to be much more interested in the plight of the industry, making statements that the support is not required. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only today we heard that leading figures in the beef industry are considering running independent Country Party candidates in the forthcoming Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, in Queensland that disenchantment will become apparent in the results of the <span class="highlight">election</span> next weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It announced an early <span class="highlight">election</span> and set in train a last minute rush to deal with a momentous legislative program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was not within the capability of that Government to control the rate of inflation, having regard to the extensive trading relations with other countries that preceded the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Australian Labor Party Government in 1972, the revaluation of the currency which flowed from the mining boom of the 1960s and the capital that poured into the country at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill dishonours the Prime Minister’s November 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, repeated as late as 11 September 1977, to establish a Rural Bank under a statutory corporation; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This action repudiates the Liberal-National Country Party <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been aborted by this premature <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is another pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is another example of the fulfilment of the policies which were projected in our rural policy speech prior to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been said that the Government has not honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I see the Australian Rural Bank in this form as completely identical with the undertaking given by us in our rural policy speech prior to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Four of our colleagues face an <span class="highlight">election</span>- four territorians and if they are not elected at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> they will not come back. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We wish him all the best in his <span class="highlight">election</span> quest for Hawker. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I conclude by wishing everybody a happy electioneering period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On behalf of the Opposition I express our best wishes to everybody during the Christmas break and our very best wishes for the success of the Australian Labor Party at the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although he was defeated in the 1946 <span class="highlight">election</span> he regained his seat as a senator in the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and represented South Australia as a Liberal Party senator from 1950 to 1968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came into the Senate and was acknowledged by the Senate by its <span class="highlight">election</span> of him to the high office of  President,  an office whose duties he discharged with singular distinction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I came to know him particularly well during the 1966 federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when he assisted me in the electorate of Grey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sir John was elected to the Senate for Victoria at the 1940 <span class="highlight">election</span>, was defeated in 1943 and was then re-elected at the subsequent elections of 1949, 1951 and 1955. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that I really do enjoy about the Opposition is that, concerning a particular Australian, we have been through two <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns in which he has been a central figure and each time the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am delighted that they are continuing this campaign because they will be thrashed at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, the one after that and the one after that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, whilst the present Opposition has emerged with the most disastrous thrashing from the <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives, honourable senators opposite should look at the Senate figures sometime; in State after State they could not even get two quotas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here they are attempting still to rake over the old coals of the period before the 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the building industry in the first three weeks following the <span class="highlight">election</span> building approvals totalling $1 ,400m were announced, and this is an area of high employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators on the Government side might say that I have every reason to be sad after the past two general elections and that is true; but there are things beyond the general <span class="highlight">election</span> results to which I want to refer and which I do find saddening. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One had stood as an Australian Labor Party candidate at the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and was appointed to the position of  deputy  principal of a school on 23 January 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, that after many years of service the teacher interrupted his employment to become a Labor Party candidate in the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because I think that what the Premier of Queensland is really saying is: ‘If the Federal Parliament regards it as the right of every Australian citizen to contest Federal elections- to vote in them but, more importantly, to contest them- as far as certain Australians are concerned, I shall take it upon myself to qualify those individual political rights which are accorded to all Australians and the qualifications will be that the right to stand for Parliament is extended to all Australian citizens except teachers employed in Queensland ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  drew attention to the desirability of there being no interference with people who offer themselves as candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> to Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all,  Sir Zelman  may have to decide during his incumbency of the office whether the present Government should have a premature <span class="highlight">election</span> or something else that it wants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> surprised everyone with regard to the size and uniformity across the country of the coalition victory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I congratulate  Senator Haines  on both her <span class="highlight">election</span> to this Parliament- it was not a foregone conclusion- and her maiden speech tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention this matter also because the <span class="highlight">election</span> of  Senator Haines  was the first after the constitutional alteration which provided for the filling of a casual vacancy by a member of the party with which the retiring member had been associated at the time of entry to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only was it the first occasion on which such a selection had to be made in South Australia, but also the senator who retired was from a party whose existence in South Australia was difficult to recognise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, the Liberal Party in that State submitted a nominee and urged at the joint sitting that its nominee should receive the selection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contention of the Liberal Party was that the party to which  Senator Steele  Hall had belonged at the time of <span class="highlight">election</span> had now merged with the Liberal Party and that, in accordance with the constitutional alteration, a Liberal Party member should receive the endorsement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second candidate on the ticket at that <span class="highlight">election</span> is now in the State House as a Liberal Party member and would not have desired <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate for a six-month period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a suggestion that the appointment by the State Government should have been held over until after the Federal elections so that if the fate of  Senator Steele  Hall was what it in fact proved to be he could be re-appointed for the six-month term as nearly expressing the opinion of the people who elected him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone knows that at the time  Senator Steele  Hall was originally elected he had different beliefs, different politics and made different utterances than he had and made when he stood at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh  seemed to think his thoughts were quite irrevelant- that somehow the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a successor to  Senator Hall  was related to the constitutional amendment which this Parliament and the people, adopted last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  spoke of the position of a person in Queensland who resigned from his position as principal of a school for the purpose of taking part in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and whom the Queensland Premier has refused to allow to return to his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Things have happened in this country, both during the <span class="highlight">election</span> period and since that time, which I think ought to have our immediate concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing which happened during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and which I regard as a matter of some seriousness was the premature disclosure of the report on human relationships. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I felt that it was a very grave disservice to the commissioners that parts of the report were leaked out and thrown into the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that we have too many elections and too early elections in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we ought soon to come to a situation where we know when elections will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can find nothing in the Westminster system of government that requires, for example, a Prime Minister to have some special right to choose, in consultation with the Governor-General, a time when there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be very useful as one possible solution to our problems if we had a fixed term, we knew where we were and we knew when the elections would be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I hear some of the cries from politicians from both sides of the Parliament that they do not like having an <span class="highlight">election</span> at a particular time because they might be a little unpopular I can say that they are condemned out of their own mouths. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I am talking about our new senator whom I welcome here as the first representative of a new Australian party, which I congratulate upon the success it achieved in the December <span class="highlight">election</span>, I raise a matter of concern in relation to that Party and I think it is fair enough to do so tonight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it was so close to the date of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, one wonders why  Mr Peacock  could not have informed the Australian people of the Government’s intention before 10 December so as to allow the citizens of Australia to vote on this issue, to make up their minds whether they believed that Indonesia had the right to move in and take over East Timor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Granted in the intervening period we have had an <span class="highlight">election</span>, but governments should not come to a halt because of elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government said during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that it was very concerned about the unemployed people in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet yesterday and during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Government said that it had a vital concern for the unemployed in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  will remember also that I raised in this chamber before the <span class="highlight">election</span> the matter of the deferred payment of unemployment relief benefits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was intrigued during the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, while in the field for some three weeks meeting hundreds of people in factories, timber mills, shops, pubs and other places that the one matter that was raised constantly by the average person was his concern about unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we have seen the pendulum swing to the stage where at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in December the management of the economy was probably the only issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As this House has the right to refuse Supply, defeat a government and force an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the other place without going to an <span class="highlight">election</span> itself, it is a very powerful House as  Senator Rae  and others have said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But as this will not happen, as  Senator Rae  and his ilk are firmly committed to the concept of a Senate which can at any time throw out the lower House even though the Senate cannot in any way be considered representative of the people in the same way as the other House is and even though many members of that Senate will have been elected many years before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of whatever government is in office, I believe the Senate will remain the rubber stamp it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be ignored by the press and populace except at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not been able to get specific information but the Minister may remember appearing with me during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign on a program called  The Policy Makers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The disappearance of a well-known  This Day Tonight  reporter from that program after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> is very distressing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do find distressing is that the only national current affairs program which gave daily coverage of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign found itself short of its main reporter at the end of the campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot agree with her interpretation of some of the voting figures in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, but if she can take comfort from the interpretation she should do so by all means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also believe that a large proportion of the Australian people who voted to oust the Labor Government at that time had some misgivings about the way in which the <span class="highlight">election</span> was engineered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in late 1977 John Kerr granted the Government an <span class="highlight">election</span> in mid term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed that Kerr was determined to give the other side an <span class="highlight">election</span> whether it wanted one or not, whether it was in government or in opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who would have believed that so cynical a deal, and so dishonest a deal, could have been set up- a job in exchange for sacking an elected government, for calling an unjustifiable early <span class="highlight">election</span> and then retiring in time for the electorate to forget about the shame of 1 1 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As one who lost in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and who has examined that defeat I shall make a few brief and general comments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of critics have forecast the end of the Labor Party and a whole new era in Australian politics as a result of the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One issue that seems to have been ignored by a great majority of them is the similarity between the elections of 1974 and 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 believe that was a crucial element in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and, as I said, one the critics seem to be ignoring. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I raise briefly another matter which was brought to my attention more strongly than ever during the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and immediately afterwards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have talked to people who scrutineered during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am referring to casual employees, those people who were put on just for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The result of the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales, even without a recount, was not known for at least a month following the ballot date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, one can see that the cost of running <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns in this country today has become crippling for all parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I congratulate the Government on its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, which was confirmed in the Governor-General’s Speech, that federal estate duty will be abolished in respect of an estate which passes from spouse to spouse or parent to child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Joh Bjelke-Petersen and  Mr Eric  Deeral of National Party will hold a pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> speech at the Bamaga Beer Canteen at approximately 3 p.m. on Monday 24 October 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is very convenient that it is two-and-a-half years to the next <span class="highlight">election</span> but I don ‘t know if the people will forget this decision. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to the <span class="highlight">election</span> results in my State of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note, when looking at the final figures- I am talking now of the primary votes in South Australia- that in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party polled 45 per cent of the votes, whilst the Australian Labor Party polled 42.6 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party in South Australia polled 49 per cent of the votes and the Labor Party 36.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a twoparty preferred basis, in South Australia in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party polled 51.3 per cent of the votes and the Labor Party 48.7 per cent; yet we in the Liberal Party finished up winning only five of the 1 1 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>- also on a two-party preferred basis- the Liberal Party received 55.9 per cent of the votes and the Labor Party received 44. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I want to make it perfectly clear that I have no criticism whatever of any of the distribution commissioners who redrew the boundaries both for the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and for the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention this matter tonight because I think there is a great need for the people of South Australia to be aware of the fact thatagain I am not being critical of the Distribution Commissioners- the guidelines under which the Commissioners had to operate were restrictive in such a way that there was a greater opportunity for the Labor Party in the State elections than there was for the anti-socialist group, if I may put it that way, to win. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-That was in October, which would be after the State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is more, he also led the ALP general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign on the anti-uranium issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was it because, as  Senator Messner  stated earlier, some things happened after the State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it to appease people and to make sure that he maximised his vote in the State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am especially interested to see how these representatives of the Party which made the Senate its particular target in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> treat this body in fact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to make one or two comments, in opening, about the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>, a subject in which the Australian Democrats are, of course, highly relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the declaration of the poll in Queensland I made some comments on the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not intend to repeat that sentence this evening, but would like to repeat a little of what I said on that occasion concerning my impressions on the <span class="highlight">election</span> and what it meant to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without doubt, the overwhelming mood of the electorate in 1977 was one of weariness and cynicism; not necessarily weariness at having to vote again, because there was a special situation in Queensland in that only one month earlier there had been voting for the State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe every candidate in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, regardless of party, would have been quite aware of that sentiment on the part of a significant section of the Australian public, which is a thinking and caring public, one which cares about this nation and wants to see government, whatever its political colour, clearly motivated towards acting in the interests of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points which are scored in this place frequently come too cheap and, unfortunately, especially so during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, when the attention of the media is really centered on the politicians, especially the leaders: That sort of point scoring becomes monotonous, tedious and disillusioning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>We cannot just believe that it will just go away for another three years, until the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Mensaros  is successful in allowing fully foreign-owned companies to operate, and one presumes that if they are fully foreign-owned they are also fully foreign-controlled, it could jeopardise thousands of jobs in my State as well as raising doubts about the credibility of  Sir Charles  Court’s pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise of majority Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He gave the job figures in a statement which he said showed that the Government’s performance had matched its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the Government will uphold the promises made in this place last week by the Governor-General, any more than I believe that the Government upheld the promises it made prior to the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> or the previous general <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He was defeated at that <span class="highlight">election</span> and was reemployed by the Education Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it would appear that the policy is to depress the economy during the 1978-79 period in the hope that we will see a return to some levels of prosperity by 1980, which is when the next <span class="highlight">election</span> is due. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think one of the most important events which has taken place over recent years, however little it may so far have accomplished, has been the statement by the  President  of the United States of America shortly after his <span class="highlight">election</span> that in future the United States Administration would not look merely at the national interests of the United States of America in assessing its relations with foreign countries but would also look at the human rights of citizens within foreign countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the elections held in South Africa in 1974, which were elections in which only whites were able to vote, the Progressive Party- a party which may be a capitalist party and which may have all sorts of planks in its platform with which I would not agree but which is certainly a party that is committed to racial equality within South Africa and an equal voice for all citizens in the government of South Africa- won seven seats, having won only one seat in the previous elections when  Mrs Suzman,  who for many years was its only member, was re-elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the most recent elections held in South Africa, despite the fact that the National Party gained an overwhelming majority in the South African House of Assembly, the Progressive Federal Party, which is a new party that is committed to the same basic policies as the older Progressive Party, achieved the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 17 members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was referring to the results of the <span class="highlight">election</span>-  of the people’s conviction that the basic direction of the Government’s policies reflects their aspirations and interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Due to the intervention of the <span class="highlight">election</span> it was necessary to postpone the meeting of the Australian Education Council which was to have been held in November in Canberra under my chairmanship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was first endorsed in 1 970 to contest the 1970 half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was the case with a lot of senators elect, I thought I would be a member of this chamber for six years before I faced an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because of the lust for power of the people who now sit on the Government benches, I had to face two more elections before I had even completed my first six years in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At such a time not only the events which I have cited will be taken into consideration; all the false promises made during the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and again during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year will be taken into consideration also. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the September <span class="highlight">election</span> and the challenge which was thrown out by  Mr Tonkin,  the Labor Party in South Australia was returned to office with a record majority of seven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Tonkin  is somewhat the same as honourable senators opposite and supporters of the Government in the other place were after the 1972 general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They forced us to an <span class="highlight">election</span> 18 months after we were elected into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Two of the most important matters on which  Senator Young  dwelt were the <span class="highlight">election</span> results in South Australia, and he made a very interesting comment on that subject, and the question of uranium, about which he misquoted several things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I deal now with what  Senator Young  had to say on the <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to refer to the elections results in my State of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note, when looking at the final figures- I am talking now of the primary votes in South Australiathat in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party polled 45 per cent of the votes, whilst the Australian Labor Party polled 42.6 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party in South Australia polled 49 per cent of the votes and the Labor Party 36.8 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On a two-party preferred basis, in South Australia in the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party polled 5 1.3 per cent of the votes and the Labor Party 48.7 per cent; yet we in the Liberal Party finished up winning only five of the 1 1 seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He went on to say, referring to <span class="highlight">election</span> figures: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let us examine the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the last occasion in any South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> that the Liberal Party polled the majority of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find hononourable senators coming into this place and criticising the last Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are saying that because they got so close in the overall figure for South Australia at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> they were robbed of one seat in particular- yet nothing was said in all those years about the times when the Labor Party had a massive majority but could not form a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have experimented with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of supervisors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He made no mention of the fact that this very important report should have been tabled in this Parliament last year, before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, so that people could see that the mining of uranium is not the great money spinner and employer of labour that the present Government told the people of Australia it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of Australia passed their clear judgment on these events and  Sir John’s  actions in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been used as an emotional argument in two general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns but the argument has failed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Haines reminded us in her maiden speech that at the last House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span> 48 per cent of the population supported the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think we know that there are traditional swingers- if I can use the word traditionalin the sense that these people oscillate between elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We saw the effect of this in the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that in the 77 years of federation the Labor Party has been in office for about only 14 years, and at each <span class="highlight">election</span> the conservative forces of this country close their ranks and in unison heap blame on previous Labor governments for the poor state of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>True it is that the Labor Party was heavily defeated in 1975 and again in 1 977 but, as  Senator Haines-  I congratulate the honourable senator who recently joined us from South Australia on the making of her maiden speech- said, when one analyses the results that came from the last <span class="highlight">election</span> this Government need not necessarily crow or gloat about them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the sheer weight of media bias principally that won the <span class="highlight">election</span> in the manner that it was so decisively won by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the case in 1 943 and again in 1946, when the newspaper proprietors of this nation generally supported the re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of the Curtin and Chifley Labor governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was the case in 1974, when at least the Murdoch group of newspapers remained neutral in its attitude towards the re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it was that we lost, and lost heavily, in 1975, when all of the newspaper groups- those privileged groups of peopleviolently opposed the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am now saying that it was politically neutral until the last couple of days of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One only has to look at the front page editorial of the Sydney  Daily Telegraph  of the day before the <span class="highlight">election</span>- the editorial on 9 December headed: ‘We can’t afford a change ‘-to realise this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doubtless, when one takes into account the country Press it is only axiomatic to say that there was a one-sided <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and a onesided <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that there were faults in the Labor movement <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly  Senator Rae  made some mention of this during the course of his remarks when he said that wherever he went throughout the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign he found that a feeling was being engendered or being felt in a lot of industries that people who were out of work need not necessarily have been out of work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For an outline of what happened in the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> I merely rely upon a report, written by Valerie Lawson, which appeared on page 1 of the  Australian Financial Review  on 14 December 1977, four days after the general <span class="highlight">election</span> was held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Masius booklet, titled ‘The anatomy of a political merchandising idea,’  Mr Reason  says the agency’s major problem was overcoming the boredom of the uncommitted voter faced with yet another <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mention that to indicate that it was the excessive weight of the campaign that was conducted by the media proprietors against the Labor Party, the campaign based on the selfishness and altruism of the Liberal Party, that was primarily responsible for the defeat of the Labor Party at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had four elections in five years- one in 1972, one in 1974, one in 1975 and another in 1977- and all of them were called ahead of their time by the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general <span class="highlight">election</span> or resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important respect- if he cannot get supply he must resign or advise an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Prime Minister refuses to resign or to advise an <span class="highlight">election</span>, and this is the case with  Mr Whitlam,  my constitutional authority and duty require me to do what I have now done- to withdraw his commission- and to invite the Leader of the Opposition to form a caretaker government- that is one that makes no appointments or dismissals and initiates no policies, until a general <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result is that there will be an early general <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses and the people can do what, in a democracy such as ours, is their responsibility and duty and theirs alone. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all the circumstances which have occurred the appropriate means is a dissolution of the Parliament and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for both Houses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When, however, an Upper House possesses the power to reject a money bill including an appropriation bill, and exercises the power by denying supply, the principle that a government which has been denied supply by the Parliament should resign or go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> must still apply- it is a necessary consequence of Parliamentary control of appropriation and expenditure and of the expectation that the ordinary and necessary services of government will continue to be provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been discussion of the possibility that a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> might be held under circumstances in which the Government has not obtained supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If such advice were given to me I should feel constrained to reject it because a half-Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> held whilst supply continues to be denied does not guarantee a prompt or sufficiently clear prospect of the deadlock being resolved in accordance with proper principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have previously told me that you would never resign or advise an <span class="highlight">election</span> of the House of Representatives or a double dissolution and that the only way in which such an <span class="highlight">election</span> could be obtained would be by my dismissal of you and your ministerial colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I propose to send for the Leader of the Opposition and to commission him to form a new caretaker Government until an <span class="highlight">election</span> can be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They were terribly disappointed and terribly unhappy that they received very little information about the recent general <span class="highlight">election</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did not ask any of them their political views, but they were deeply disappointed that they were unable to cast a vote in the general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Top level people there- I will not mention names; no names, no pack drill- were all critical of the fact that an <span class="highlight">election</span> had been held and they were not part of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has subsequently recovered some considerable ground, but in the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> many members were defeated and Bill Wood and Peter Wood, his brother, were two of those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, they carry out an accepted and commendable exercise in taking part in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To get back to the point I am making, Bill Wood is entitled to be reinstated and candidates who are defeated in an <span class="highlight">election</span> in every other State are, to my knowledge, reinstated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that if a person is a State employee in Queensland he cannot stand for a council <span class="highlight">election</span> because he will not be able to attend the meetings which are held during the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland there are hundreds of State employees who seek to serve their community and who would like to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> for non-paid, voluntary jobs but who are prevented from doing so because they are refused leave of absence to attend council meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland made a most interesting speech in which he said that the Labor Party lost the <span class="highlight">election</span> because Rupert Murdoch and Warwick Fairfax wrote a number of editorials in the last week of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps honourable senators opposite ought to read what is alleged to be a report of  Mr David  Combe, the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, which he presented to a meeting of the ALP Federal Executive on 30 July 1975, after the Bass by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Has the Minister for Administrative Services been made aware of a report by the Australian Electoral Office stating that 731,555 Australians, or 9 per cent of the total poll, voted informally at the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> last December? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of informal votes cast varies from <span class="highlight">election</span> to <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figure was lower for the <span class="highlight">election</span> after the double dissolution of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the last separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> the figure was much higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assume that in 1975 the people of Australia were so anxious to make certain that the Whitlam Government did not get back to office that they concentrated on filling out a formal ballot paper and that at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> they were so convinced that the Liberal and National Country Parties would win easily they did not take so much care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of course, the messages concerning the appointment of members to this Committee and other such committees have always come from the House of Representatives after each House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>; but over at least the last 10 or 12 years my colleagues in this chamber have taken the view that the Senate is a House in constitutional life irrespective of the dissolution of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These considerations were interrupted by the recent general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those considerations would have been interrupted by a general <span class="highlight">election</span> regardless of whether it had been held last year or this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I do not imagine that the time lost due to the general <span class="highlight">election</span> will make any great difference to the plans we had in mind and the time factor envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since it was an important policy matter in accordance with traditional practice they agreed that the matter be held over for consideration after the <span class="highlight">election</span> when the matter could be determined by a committee of Ministers without further reference to Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was timed to meet the needs of the Western Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Minister made an arrangement with the producers of a television program to give an exclusive interview on this and related matters, provided that the matter would not be exposed prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  speech was designed primarily to defend the position of one  Mr Bill  Wood, who was an Australian Labor Party candidate at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He lost his seat in the November 1977 State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This did not happen to  Mr David  Byrne a defeated Liberal candidate at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland was held on 12 November. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there were indeed several known vacancies before the State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were advertised in the newspaper on the day of the State <span class="highlight">election</span>, which I suggest was totally coincidental. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Georges’ statement that there was no advertising of the position and no vacancy prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> is just untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was a program on  This Day Tonight  in Queensland- I am sorry I cannot cite the date, but I know it was in the week before Parliament resumed so I could find out the datewhich related to  Mr Wood  and made the statement that Messrs Byrne, Lamont and Young had achieved high government appointments after their defeat at the <span class="highlight">election</span>, although  Mr Wood  could not get the position he wanted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it ought to be noted that, far from this being a top government job,  Mr Young  returned to work at the Queensland Police Force in the Juvenile Aid Bureau without any recognition of his service prior to his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the State Parliament in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Deaf Society advertised the position during October 1977 and it had not been filled by the time  Mr Lamont  was defeated in the November Queensland State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I said under privilege last Thursday night was that  Mr Byrne  had been appointed to a position in the Police Academy, having been defeated at the previous State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At  Mr BjelkePetersen’s  direction, an application for Public Service appointment from a member of the Labor Party who has been defeated at an <span class="highlight">election</span> is a matter for the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clear lines of that appointment were these: The person concerned was to be a candidate at the next State <span class="highlight">election</span> and the job would facilitate his movement around the electorate of Cook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The person who stood at the House of Representatives <span class="highlight">election</span>- Bill Woodhad to resign because of the requirements of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I doubt that the Minister could tonight give me an answer on this case, but it seems to me that if a person left Australia in 1975- about the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>- and before any decision had been made by the Government to provide for a sixweek waiting period before people who left a job of their own accord could obtain unemployment benefit, it is rather unfair that they should now have to wait for that period because of that decision in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apparently this situation follows an <span class="highlight">election</span> in late 1 977 for a position in the Tasmanian division of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations when a  Mr Cooper,  who had been the nominee of ACSPA, was defeated and  Mr Lavey  was elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the <span class="highlight">election</span> just passed  Mr Fraser  attempted to win votes by branding his opponents as ‘free traders’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is ironic that, on the day  Mr Fraser  was admonishing the Europeans, the Philippines Government expressed its concern that the policy announced during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign would virtually extend for another three years the ‘temporary’ protection being given to several inefficient Australian industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to the second part of the amendment, I recall vividly that prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made very critical public statements about Industries Assistance Commission reports that had been presented from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Why should they be entitled to a job with the Commonwealth Government when they are superannuated on retiring allowances after being defeated at an <span class="highlight">election</span> or going out of the Parliament when their services are no longer required by the people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the report of the royal commission which has been awaited for a long time by many people throughout Australia first came into public view when the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, chose to bring it into the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in November last year in a misleading, distorted and irresponsible way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that he was condemned by all sections of the Press, by the commissioners themselves and by many people who had made submissions to the royal commission, for his absolutely cynical use of the report during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister says that he has written to the Premiers seeking their views, but I wonder what that means when the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  felt free to express their hostile and negative views without even having read the report during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Ratification of the Covenant would be desirable, particularly in the light of Australia’s <span class="highlight">election</span> to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other $1.5m, for which this Bill makes an appropriation, and the $200m promised, which is something separate from this Bill, over five years for future water resource development projects, are two specimens of the grab bag of promises conjured up by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during the weekend before he delivered his policy speech last year, when he thought that he was in considerable danger of losing the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those restrictions were not applied because of the cynical opportunism of the Court Government which was facing an <span class="highlight">election</span> and which did not want the public to be appraised of the fact that the Government which claims to be a government of development and so on had failed in one of its primary developmental obligations, namely to provide an adequate water supply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Water restrictions were not imposed for the summer of 1976-77 when they really should have been because the Government was facing an <span class="highlight">election</span> and it did not want its crumbling clay feet to be exposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Bill forms the legislative framework which will enable the Commonwealth to provide finance to the States for various water projects and, in effect, provides the legislative means whereby the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise on this subject will be fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Two years later, in November 1966- it is of interest to note that this was at about the time of the general Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>- the Commonwealth announced the national water resources development program, under which it would provide non-repayable grants to the States of up to a total of $50m over five years for water conservation works aimed at reducing the hazards of drought, and of expanding primary production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly, the Fraser Government, in the two years that it has been in office, has  shown a total lack of regard for water resources in Australia- until it was forced to take an interest in them a mere month before the recent federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After that, we will, as we have committed ourselves in our policy speeches in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, be taking steps to take real action to solve the River Murray salinity problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I was glad that he reminded the Senate that several letter bombs were sent through the post during the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and that a non-political individual- a totally innocent person- who had the responsibility of opening the mail in the Queensland Premier’s Department was blown up by a bomb because proper security precautions were not taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that when we address public meetings during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, when feelings tend to run a little high, and when we do other things of that nature there is a certain risk attached. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the last few weeks, in my role as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations, I have visited the Commission of the EEC and several member states- Denmark, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom, the timing of the <span class="highlight">election</span> making it preferable to visit France later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister representing the Treasurer recall the Prime Minister’s promising during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Federal Government would abolish Federal death duties as from November 1977 with respect to succession by spouses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign stated that prompt steps would be taken after the last <span class="highlight">election</span> to implement a scheme which would subsidise freight differentials involved in transporting eligible petroleum products from refining ports and seaboard terminals to country sale points. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also say to  Senator Walsh  that rather than his Party, both Federal and State, setting up committees to discover why it lost the last <span class="highlight">election</span> it ought to be looking at his remarks and wondering why the workers of Australia will not vote for the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our <span class="highlight">election</span> to the United Nations Human Rights Commission in May of this year gives us an additional reason for doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has agreed that in some circumstances it should be possible to cancel such elections, for example where it is apparent that at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> all relevant information was not available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill provides that in deciding whether or not an <span class="highlight">election</span> may be cancelled the <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This scheme will not equalise petrol prices, and it does not honour the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  given in November last. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government will take action to equalise the price of petroleum products between city and country, without adding to city prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because this Bill, which has been misleadingly called the Petrol Price Equalisation Bill, does not equalise prices and does not honour the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promises, I move that at the end of the motion these words be added:  but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) implement the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Government to equalise the price of petroleum products between city and country’, and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So nothing could be clearer than that this scheme barely scratches the surface in the implementation of the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to equalise petrol prices between city and country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Somebody said there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> and that is precisely what happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that two months’ period an <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced, and on 19 November the then Treasurer and  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party was forced to resign in disgrace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to make it clear that any such attempt absolutely repudiates the second point in the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that the Government would equalise prices without adding to city prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what the Prime Minister and his Deputy are covertly trying to force the oil companies to do absolutely repudiates the second leg of the undertaking the Prime Minister gave in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Walsh has moved an amendment, not opposing the passage of the Bill but expressing an opinion as to its inadequacy and shortcomings when considered in the light of the coalition parties’ <span class="highlight">election</span> promise and also in the light of reports received on the petroleum industry in this country, such as the report of the Royal Commission into Petroleum conducted by  Mr Justice  Collins. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should also point out to the Government that whatever we may think about the legislation, it represents a failure by the Government to uphold one of the main policy promises made before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I welcome the legislation as a redemption of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise and a worthwhile initiative to return a measure of justice to the rural community of which it was deprived by the Labor Government during its term of office from 1972 to 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a first step to implement the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy of the Prime Minister and I look forward to the day, with some optimism, when there will be complete justice for people in isolated areas of Australia, so that they will pay no more for their petrol than do their counterparts in the capital cities of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also had  Mr Fife,  the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, who was in charge of the Bill in the other place, and  Senator Tehan  quoted him, in winding up the second reading debate claiming on numerous occasions- in fact, that is about all he said at that point- that the Government had honoured an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He kept repeating what  Senator Tehan  has said here tonight, that the Government has honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Immediately after the <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government will take action to equalise the price of petroleum products between city and country, without adding to city prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him: Can he truthfully say that that <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge has been carried out? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that this carried out the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that had been made by  Mr Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has thus admitted that this legislation is in fact not carrying out the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, although he claimed only a few moments ago- as had  Mr Fife  in the other place- that it did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will quote from page 25 of the Budget Speech delivered by the then Treasurer,  Mr Lynch-  and we all know what happened to him during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the statements made in the Senate this evening and in the other place that the Government has honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that it would bring in legislation which in effect will not increase country prices by more than 4c a gallon above city prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of this country will quickly find out what the Government is doing, just as it found out about another magnificent promise that the Government made during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in respect of a newspaper advertisement which depicted a hand holding a bunch of $5 notes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe those people will have second thoughts and that they will not be fooled again when people such as  Senator Tehan  claim in this Parliament that the Government has honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises on petrol subsidies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have looked at  Mr Fife’s  second reading speech and I can see nothing in it which leads me to believe that the Goverment, as  Senator Tehan  claimed, has honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise by introducing this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we now have to wait for nearly three years for the electors to be given the opportunity to pass judgment not only on this legislation but also on other legislation which will no doubt come before this Parliament as a result of the Government ‘s <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and which again will be claimed by Government supporters as evidence that the Government is honouring its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there will be other members of his Party who will come in for some very severe criticism unless, of course,  Mr Howard,  the new Treasurer, unlike  Mr Fife,  is prepared to honour the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I only hope that the people outside this place who have listened to the speeches made by  Senator Walsh, Senator Grimes  and me are now fully aware of the way in which they have been hoodwinked and misled by <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A few months ago, after the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland, we had the public spectacle of the Queensland Government not being able to form a Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the interests of Australian democracy let the Senate take a stand and again say, not that it will halt a budget to force an <span class="highlight">election</span> but that it will halt a particular piece of legislation on a most sensitive matter of the highest significance in Australia’s national history beginning at the definition of race relations in this country for the next 50 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other thing that perhaps could satisfy the Opposition even further is that a council of an Aboriginal reserve is a council construed under the provisions of the Queensland legislation which provides for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In doing so I emphasise that what we are doing is virtually fulfilling an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise made last year by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been indicated in the <span class="highlight">election</span> speeches of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and of the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  the cost will be further reduced to less than 0.5c a litre or 2c a gallon in the life of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill delivers yet another proposal which the people of Australia endorsed at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is worth noting that one of the three basic points on which  Senator Walsh  criticised the Bill on behalf of the Opposition is that it fails to implement the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Act presently does not allow a member of the scheme or the spouse of a deceased member to alter a decision that had been made for a particular form of benefit once it has been made- for example, the <span class="highlight">election</span> between a lump sum benefit and the payment of pension. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take this business of an <span class="highlight">election</span> for lump sum or weekly payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very essence of the idea of <span class="highlight">election</span> between recurrent annual payment and lump sum is that a person makes an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, a person must make his <span class="highlight">election</span> responsibly, and all those who directly receive the benefit should be bound by it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then a person makes an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate has passed the legislation necessary to establish the new scheme, which was one of the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises made by the Government that has now been implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first very interesting Bills which was introduced in the Senate after my <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1974 was the Family Law Bill 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was ultimately incorporated and was a major feature in the Liberal Party’s 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> rhetoric and policy documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1977 there was not one line or one word about new federalism in the Liberal Party ‘s <span class="highlight">election</span> rhetoric or policy documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal Party is as convinced of the wisdom and popularity of this policy as  Senator Carrick  ‘s remarks would have us believe, is it not strange that there was not a word about it in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is true to say that one of the major issues in the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaignSenator Gietzelt is still propounding the proposition- was that federalism will not work and that all power should be centralised in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there is a real prospect of these moves coming to fruition it would be foolish and irresponsible for the Government, in a time of budgetary constraint, to spend a lot of money by proceeding with an <span class="highlight">election</span> for a producer consultative group against the majority of industry opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that elections conducted in accordance with the principles suggested by producer organisations would cost in the order of $250,000, more than double the amount originally envisaged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There would of course also be recurring expenditure for subsequent elections and by-elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose was not to give notice of a decision to defer the <span class="highlight">election</span> but rather to provide the organisations which represent Australian livestock producers with an opportunity to give further thought to the desirability of proceeding with an <span class="highlight">election</span> at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They indicated to me that there were moves afoot, for various reasons, for the Government to defer the matter of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this group- indeed, they believed, to abandon the whole idea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today  Senator Webster  representing the Minister for Primary Industry made in this chamber a statement giving the reasons for the Government’s decision not to honour this promise to have elections by March of this year but to defer them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the statement the Minister said that one of the reasons for the deferral of the <span class="highlight">election</span> which should have been held in March was that commitments of the Australian Electoral Office late in 1 977 necessitated variation of the timetable originally proposed and, subsequently, a number of other developments influenced the finalisation of arrangements for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that those elections should have been well under way- presumably during February and certainly by early March- I wonder why no statement on the need for deferral was made by the Government until I asked a question in this place last week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that there would have been certain effects on the Australian Electoral Office presumably as a result of our having a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless there had been no statement by the Government that that would mean a deferral of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of this group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should not have waited until April to inform the leaders of the producer groups that it had decided to defer the <span class="highlight">election</span> and review the situation at the end of this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today the Minister in his statement said that there was a strong division of opinion amongst producers on this issue, with two of the four national livestock producer organisations being opposed to an electoral basis for <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the producer consultative group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To state that two of the four organisations are opposed to an electoral basis for selection of members to this body might be taken to indicate a split down the centre, but it does not give the Senate the true facts of the composition of those who support and those who oppose the proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it also ought to be spelt out to the Senate that the amalgamation was not suggested until February this year, by which time the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the producer consultative group should have been well under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the Government to claim that as a basis for a decision to defer the <span class="highlight">election</span> ignores the timing of the amalgamation proposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government may wish to claim that as a basis for now continuing to defer the <span class="highlight">election</span> but it cannot claim that as a reason for a decision which apparently was taken at the end of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the grounds for delaying the <span class="highlight">election</span> which the Minister put to the producer organisations in his letter of April was the cost involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the statement which the Minister made available to the Senate today he made the comment that in a time of budgetary restraint, to spend a lot of money by proceeding with an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the producer consultative group against the majority of industry opinion would be foolish and irresponsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If, last year, prior to the passage to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill the Minister gave undertakings to producers and producer organisations that the Government would support these elections, it was presumably prepared to support whatever those elections cost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is true that the estimate 12 months ago for this <span class="highlight">election</span> was approximately $ 125,000 and if the estimate is now $250,000, the Minister has raised many questions which he ought to answer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether it was a part of the problem but I do know that since I have been in this place I have found that matters to be decided by an <span class="highlight">election</span> of producers always raise the question of who is to have a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it was not within my power to decide who would have a vote if such an <span class="highlight">election</span> were held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In November a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced and the Electoral Office would have been more than busy during November, December and January. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again I acknowledged that if an <span class="highlight">election</span> were to be held, it could have been put in hand probably in February, March or April of this year, as the honourable senator suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that the Australian Wool and Meat Producers’ Federation, which claims to represent the largest number of beef cattle and other livestock producers, has indicated to the Minister that it does not favour deferring the holding of the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the producers consultative group? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also a fact that the Cattlemen’s Union of Australia favours holding the <span class="highlight">election</span> as soon as possible? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that is the case, what are the real reasons for the Minister’s deferring the <span class="highlight">election</span> for the beef producers consultative group? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable senator believes that there is some other reason why the <span class="highlight">election</span> is not being held, he might care to put that to me, but I will seek an answer from  Mr Sinclair  immediately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am unable to say whether the Minister for Primary Industry would immediately negotiate an <span class="highlight">election</span> if the majority of producers, that is, the majority of members who produced beef, were to request it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was raised that, whether a farmer produces two or three head of beef or whether he produces 50,000, some consideration should be given to when an <span class="highlight">election</span> is a proper thing, but I will refer the matter to the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign,  Mr Anthony  became even more reckless and less factual in his statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, sugar prices are falling, contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister said during that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate, Denham Henty had had a long and distinguished career in local government, having been a Launceston alderman from 1943 and subsequently mayor of that city in 1948 and 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate in 1949,  Senator Henty  was well equipped to represent his State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had known ex-Senator Henty even before his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the , Parliament- during the time in which he was the Mayor of the City of Launceston, the city in which I was born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the Bill itself,  Senator Wriedt  has correctly reminded the Senate that the matter was floated in legislative form prior to the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> and it is my recollection that it was then circulated to the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer him to the following <span class="highlight">election</span> promise made by the Prime Minister on 21 November 1977: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assertion made yesterday by  Senator Lewis  that the people of this country voted at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> for the mining, milling and use of uranium is nonsense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was not part of the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they would be hardly moving in demountable buildings and other types of buildings to storage areas in August of last year if they had not received the green light from this Government before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately upon his <span class="highlight">election</span> to Federal Parliament,  Sir Robert  was appointed AttorneyGeneral and Minister for Industry- portfolios he held until 1939. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that year- just five years after his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the House of Representatives- he became Prime Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall, as others will, that he acknowledged publicly in his own electorate that he would support John McEwen-  Sir John  McEwen as he is now- when a section of  Sir Robert’s  party thought it wise to stand against John McEwen in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like  Senator Wright,  I came into office after the 1949 general <span class="highlight">election</span> when  Sir Robert  was swept back into office as Prime Minister  of  this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may feel that, although you went to the elections with us, you were not consulted on some particular aspect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advice that he gave us after the 1949 <span class="highlight">election</span> is advice upon which I have always acted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw his activities from a different direction, namely, as one who lived in his electorate, who worked as an officer in his branches in <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, along with a lot of other people, and who saw the way in which he campaigned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From those days until the time when he ceased to be a member of parliament I well recollect the way in which Liberal Party members in Victoria supported him strongly and to what degree they admired and appreciated his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign speeches and the way in which he fought out <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The period when  Sir Robert  was a figure in politics was a period when people came to <span class="highlight">election</span> meetings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that way he demonstrated that he had respect for the ordinary Australian citizen and that he was prepared to bandy words and speak to him during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780523_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he noted that the advertisement included comments reportedly made by a Government spokesman during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign to the effect that he believed it necessary to identify a special fund to make allocations specifically for the reconstruction of the Stuart Highway? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators might recall that after the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party’s former Cabinet Ministers went on strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The Premier said that because the Liberal Party had lost votes and seats in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> he did not think it was entitled to the eight Ministers it had in the previous Cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was repudiated after the 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span> in the case of the Larakeah people, the Gurindji people and others in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> on 12 November 1977,  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  was told in no uncertain terms that neither community wanted his government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was set out in the policy statements concerning the November 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> and ought to be restated now lest there be any concern in the community that there should be a need for the Opposition to seek a further declaration of policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has given effect to its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy statement with regard to Aboriginal land rights, first by legislating and secondly by providing money to the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission for the purchase of land outside reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the benefit of Opposition senators I would like to read the policy of the Liberal-National Country Parties, as stated during the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With regard to the exceptions, section 158P provides for inquiries into alleged irregularities in amalgamation ballots under the Act and Part IX for inquiries into alleged irregularities in elections in organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The exclusion of appeals does not extend to convictions for offences in connection with amalgamation ballots or inquiries into <span class="highlight">election</span> irregularities which will be subject to appeal to a full court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every time there is an <span class="highlight">election</span> they go out on the public hustings and say that the Senate is a States House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely if the Government has adequate safeguards they must be an improvement on what was contained in the uranium package of statements that was put out as Liberal Party propaganda during the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, it was before the public of Australia in the general <span class="highlight">election</span> of that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister In view of the promise and the undertaking by the Prime Minister before the <span class="highlight">election</span> that the Medibank scheme would be retained in its then current form, how does the Government justify the current policy which chips away the benefits of the scheme and also the promises of future reductions in benefits? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The schedules to the Administrative Changes (Consequential Provisions) Bill specify some 550 separate amendments of some 180 Acts which need to be made because of the ministerial and departmental changes made following the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst that is a winning plea as <span class="highlight">election</span> propaganda, in fact the legislation of this Government is wholly anti-Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But from what she said I gained the impression that she interpreted the results of the past general <span class="highlight">election</span> as indicating to the Senate and to the people of Australia that the Australian Democrats had something significant to say about the Australian Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I recall the Press discussion on the policies of the Australian Democrats at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, it was to the effect that the Australian Democrats had no policy, particularly in relation to matters such as constitutional reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will not be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for nearly three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since the thirtyfirst Parliament commenced, several honourable senators have addressed themselves to the problems faced by Queensland public servants who are candidates in a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Wood  was the Australian Labor Party’s candidate for the Federal seat of Leichhardt in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A former member of the Queensland State Parliament,  Mr Wood  was teaching prior to the 1977 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given these events in Queensland, it is timely that we in the Senate pay attention to the problems faced by public servants who wish to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With Parliamentary democracy under some threat in this modern age, it is of great importance that as few restrictions as possible are placed on people who desire to contest Federal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provided justice prevails, <span class="highlight">election</span> results are accepted by both the victor and the vanquished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also profitable to look at the obstacles which are faced by a public servant who contests a State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this section is that a member of the Commonwealth or State Public Service who seeks <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament must resign prior to nomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the public servant does not resign and is successful in the <span class="highlight">election</span>, he runs the risk of having his place in the House of Representatives or the Senate being declared vacant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Commonwealth public servant resigns to seek <span class="highlight">election</span> and is unsuccessful, sections 47c and 82b of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1922 provide that he may be re-appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions- sections 47c and 82b- state only that a person who was a public servant or a temporary public servant, and who resigned to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span>, may be re-appointed by the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the lack of right of re-appointment, I am not aware of a case where a Commonwealth public servant has been refused permission to rejoin the Commonwealth Public Service after contesting an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be long before the Commonwealth public servant who unsuccessfully contested an <span class="highlight">election</span> was refused re-appointment to the Public Service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is pertinent to examine the position of State public servants who resign to seek <span class="highlight">election</span> to Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Queensland, the Crown Employees Act 1958 section 3 covers the case of a Queensland public servant who resigns to contest a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was discussing section 44 of the Constitution and how it relates to public servants who are standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was outlining the position of State public servants who resign to seek <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation 89 of the Western Australian Public Service Act Regulations 1964 provides that an officer may be granted leave of absence to conduct a State or Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the fact that this regulation is expressed to cover elections to State or Federal Parliament, I am advised that it is considered unlikely that it could in fact be applicable to Federal elections because of section 44 of the Commonwealth Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regulation does not specify any reappointment rights if an officer resigns to contest an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it remains uncertain whether a Western Australian public servant who resigned to contest a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> would be reappointed automatically. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to note that the situation is quite different for public servants who wish to contest a State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly a Commonwealth public servant who wishes to seek nomination for <span class="highlight">election</span> to a State parliament is required to resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave of absence will not be granted to any officer or employee to enable him to campaign for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand a State public servant seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> to a State Parliament is generally not required to resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most States have legislation, usually the Constitution Act, which disqualifies a person holding an office or place of profit under the Crown from seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> to State Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State public servants are usually granted leave to contest elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Presumably Commonwealth public servants and public servants of other States would still be required to resign to contest a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the public servant does not resign the Board is at present not prepared to grant leave for the purpose of contesting an <span class="highlight">election</span> though there is nothing to prevent it from doing so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Board apparently is aware of being a party to a defective declaration of eligibility for <span class="highlight">election</span> by a public servant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legislative provisions require public servants to resign before seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 4ka of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1970 as amended by the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974 disqualifies a person employed in the Public Service of the Territory or of the Commonwealth from being a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore a public servant must resign in order to contest a Legislative Assembly <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, no restrictions apply to public servants seeking <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From this review it may be seen that the public servant who contests a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> is treated more harshly than his counterpart who contests a State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most salient feature in regard to State elections is that in all States except South Australia no constitutional requirements necessitate State public servants to resign to contest a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in their own State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 3 provides that the Governor-in-Council may reappoint someone to the State Public Service after he or she has resigned to contest a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There seems to me to be only one course of action to take- to ask the Australian people to alter the Constitution to remove the requirement which obliges public servants to resign to contest a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a constitutional change is made, it may still be necessary to alter some existing legislation or regulations which unnecessarily fetter the rights of public servants to stand for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Armed with comments from others it may be possible for me to work towards the goal of providing public servants with the same rights to offer themselves for <span class="highlight">election</span> as are enjoyed by their fellow Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I abstain from any comment on the subject to which our attention has been addressed except to say that public servants are the servants of the public and if they want to stand for parliamentary honours they do what other people do; that is, take the risk of <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1972, under the Whitlam Government, the Australian Government policy announced in a pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> speech stated that pre-school education would be made available within six years to every child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December of that year, just 12 months after the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech, in a national broadcast the then Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 29 April 1974 it was announced that the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy with respect to pre-school and child care was estimated to cost $130m in a full year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1975, when the present Government came into office, although there had been an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the meantime, the Liberal-National Country Party <span class="highlight">election</span> policy stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They too are feeling the pinch because of the Government’s decision to renege on its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise and a promise again made in February 1 976 by the Minister that the arrangements for funding 75 per cent of the cost of salaries and other costs which go with it would continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the government, to put it in political terms, lowered the boom 10 days ago the by-product was that a number of political leaders who were grooming themselves, perhaps girding their loins, for the future national <span class="highlight">election</span> which had been promised by the junta suddenly found that they were being rounded up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the last part of  Senator Walters’  question, I assume that within the law as it presently stands the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> does represent the opinion of the union members as ascertained in the ballot conducted under those terms and conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite interesting that  Mr Vanderheiden  stood as a candidate in the last local government <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780530_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Button  may recall, the 1976 Act was part of an undertaking by the Fraser Government in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy that it should not vary the policies implemented by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am reminded of a statement in this chamber along those lines by the Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  shortly after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact of these critics has been most noticeable since the 1975 federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the removal of another ABC current affairs reporter, George Negus, was more blatant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign there was at least one example to direct pressure successfully being applied by the Fraser office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following day, 27 October, the Prime Minister announced the <span class="highlight">election</span> date. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That sort of thing really came to an end with the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a political situation it could very well be argued that <span class="highlight">election</span> results have something to do with success and with failure, perhaps not as much as she would like to acknowledge, but on the other hand they cannot be dismissed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The address concerned the 1 974 <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Never in its history will the Australian Broadcasting Commission be under such close scrutiny as during the coming <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Townsville in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Minister for Trade and Resources became even bolder and he said, as reported in the  Sydney Morning Herald ofl  December: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating a number of Bills which are designed to implement the Government’s undertaking, given at the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>, to abolish estate duty and gift duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place I think it should be recognised that the abolition of estate duty and the gift duties surrounding it was one of the major platforms and one of the significant platforms in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that in abolishing estate duty and the gift duty that surrounds it the Government is honouring yet another- I mark the words ‘yet another’- of its <span class="highlight">election</span> promotions or undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard  Senator Button,  engage in his usual personal and vitriolic attack on the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  this time for carrying out the terms of the promise made prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This legislation is the result of one of the very few <span class="highlight">election</span> promises that this Government has kept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- This ends the second reading debate on four quite important Bills which discharge a policy undertaking, made by the Fraser Government in its last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, which has the widespread support of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate, in order that we will know the substance of the vote taken at the second reading stage, that the first change that is made by the Bills relating to estate duty is that estate duty will not be payable by the estate of a person who died on or after 2 1 November 1977- that was part of the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy promise- in respect of” a family property that is passing to the surviving spouse, a child, a grandchild, a parent or a grandparent of the deceased person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why should the people of Australia not have some say directly about those people who are to discuss the future amendments to their Constitution, as opposed to the executives which are so far removed by processes of <span class="highlight">election</span> from the people that, whilst we can say that democracy prevails, we cannot say that for this purpose democracy prevails. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is one thing for some people to say that 60 per cent of the people of Australia voted in favour of simultaneous elections– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister recall my asking him a question on 4 May 1978 relating to the deferral of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Producers’ Consultative Group to be established under the provisions of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he recall further that on 8 May 1978 he told the Senate, in answer to my question, that the Minister for Primary Industry had informed him that ‘commitments of the Australian Electoral Office late in 1977 necessitated a variation of the timetable originally proposed for this <span class="highlight">election</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I respond as follows: I recall  Senator Martin’s  question of 4 May relating to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Producers Consultative Group to be established under the provisions of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act of 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am informed that at no stage did the Australian Electoral Office indicate that it would be unable to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> for a Producers Consultative Group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last July, when announcing the formation of the Producers Consultative Group, the Minister for Primary Industry said that he had agreed to elections for this Group and indicated that this may take some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There followed, of course, the announcement of the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Primary Industry again wrote to the four major groups on 13 April this year seeking their views on now proceeding with an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the PCG membership or deferring it for review towards the end of 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister no doubt took this fact into consideration in not proceeding to an <span class="highlight">election</span> earlier this year following the finalisation of the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On another occasion I visited a local authority for which grants that had been made directly from the Commonwealth to provide special employment facilities for Aborigines were held up for many months by the Queensland Government because it was opportune to do so since it was the eve of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that principle were to be applied to governments, it would mean that in every country of the world where optional voting prevails- I think that that is every country except Australia- the parties which are now in government would be in opposition, on the ground that less than 50 per cent of the total people entitled to vote voted for them, and the parties which lost the <span class="highlight">election</span> would be in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We committed to the Australian people at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year and previously that no longer would personal income tax continue to rise because of consequential rises through inflation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that was probably a fundamental issue in the minds of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not be long before there is another <span class="highlight">election</span> and then it will have to answer for these promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and the Labor Party is returned to office I hope that we will be able to explore these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, that Bill provides, firstly, that the Council of the University shall not authorise a students representative council to expend moneys raised by the University for the provision of amenities or services unless the governing body of that Council is elected by students in an <span class="highlight">election</span> at which not less than one quarter of the students entitled to vote have voted; secondly, that the Council of the University is to have a duty to ensure that any moneys it makes available to a student organisation for the provision of amenities and services are applied bona fide to the provision of amenities and services of direct benefit to the University; thirdly, that the Council is to have published and freely available to students at least twice a year an audited statement as to the amount of fees paid by students for amenities or services that are not of an academic nature, the organisations to which any part of these moneys have been paid and the purposes for which they have been expended; and fourthly, a provision that no person shall be required to be a member of any body or organisation in order to entitle him to be admitted as a student or to graduate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw the attention of the Committee to this clause because, as I understand it, it provides for additional remumeration for office holders to be dependent upon their <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the amendment provides that where someone has a six-year term, which is the normal term of a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, and he gets through the first three years of that term those three years will constitute one of the occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were elections in 1972, 1974, 1975 and 1977- four elections in five years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us suppose that two of those elections were caused by double dissolutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this clause as amended, in applying to honourable senators, mean that a senator who has served for those five years is entitled to a pension for life if, after surviving two double dissolutions, he resigns after the fourth <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If an honourable senator serves for five yearsthat is after four elections for the House of Representatives and three for the Senate, namely, the original <span class="highlight">election</span> and two double dissolutionsand then resigns, does he become entitled to a life-time pension because of those five years of service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p>It is true that there would be a series of quick and early elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Over that period where there are quick elections there are members who will qualify at an earlier stage than they would have qualified under the eight-year rule. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If an <span class="highlight">election</span> is made, future payments of retiring allowance are reduced by that percentage and the  Senator receives,  in lieu of the pension foregone, a lump sum calculated by multiplying the annual amount of pension foregone by the following: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would have thought that he was the very person who, in the words that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  has referred me to, was the person who by reason of having satisfied the Trust that his resignation was made bona fide on account of ill-health or that his failure to be such a candidate at an <span class="highlight">election</span> was due to ill-health as the case may be and he is not deemed to have retired voluntarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>elections of members of the House of Representatives are held, or a certain event occurs-  an <span class="highlight">election</span> of a member of the House of Representatives is held, at the same time as such a Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>, a candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> either as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand it applies to a person who does not seek <span class="highlight">election</span> but who will be able to satisfy the Trust that he has not sought <span class="highlight">election</span> on the ground of ill health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the last federal <span class="highlight">election</span> a very prominent Australian businessman said to me that the Australian community had gone too far in giving a man, such as the present Prime Minister, a massive majority in the House of Representatives and a clear mandate in the Senate, that with three years ahead of him and with his idiosyncrasies Australians did not know what they had done to themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What  Senator Carrick  is actually admitting, by that statement, is that last year the Government drew up a phoney set of accounts because it planned to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>; that it deliberately excluded moneys which it knew it would spend later on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are discussing the States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Bill which is in fact an <span class="highlight">election</span> policy commitment by the LiberalNational Country Party Government and will provide $300m to the States over the next five years, commencing on 1 July, by way of nonrepayable grants to upgrade urban public transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although I would like to have seen South Australia attract a little more finance than the sum of $20m- I mentioned that I thought $30m would be a more appropriate figure- I am glad to see that the Commonwealth Government has fulfilled an <span class="highlight">election</span> policy commitment and is providing this money to the States for this very important purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On assuming office and in pursuance of the policy of this Government announced during the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speeches of 1975, my colleague, the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Aderman)  introduced into the Parliament in 1976, a Bill which set the stage for the conferral of executive responsibility on the Territory through the creation of executive members of the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> we outlined our view that payroll tax was a tax on production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At <span class="highlight">election</span> time we made an error in our policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me turn to an argument which the local Country-Liberal Party members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly have put forward, namely, that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of last year gave a mandate for statehood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking at a public forum organised by the Territory Australian Democrats on Saturday,  Mr Perron  said: ‘There can be no dispute that our <span class="highlight">election</span> victory was a mandate to institute the changes now imminent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> was fought primarily on the issue of selfdetermination and when it would arrive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we know from the  Deputy  Leader of the majority party,  Mr Perron,  that that party quite clearly saw the issue of the <span class="highlight">election</span> as that of statehood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if its members are using the <span class="highlight">election</span> result as an argument that they have a mandate for selfgovernment, then they are backing the wrong horse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if the result of the <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be used to determine whether the majority party has a mandate, it is obvious that the people of the Northern Territory do not want statehood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want the situation that existed in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, when the number of electors in electorates ranged from 1,686, through 2,063 and 2,486, up to 2,922 persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am vitally concerned with this legislation dealing with selfgovernment for the Northern Territory, because I was one of the members of the Committee which was set up by the Whitlam Government immediately after our <span class="highlight">election</span> to government in 1972, to look at and report on constitutional development for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The maximum term of the Legislative Assembly will be extended from three years to four years from the date the Assembly first meets after a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing was said in the second reading speech that the Committee recommended that there should be a house of 1 9 elected members and that the <span class="highlight">election</span> of those members should be carried out by way of optional preferential voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optional voting was used for the first <span class="highlight">election</span>, but as soon as this Government came to office it reverted to the old system of preferential voting, despite the wishes of the people in the Northern Territory who gave evidence to the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What happened in the Kimberleys in Western Australia last year in a State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not come to a decision on it until the Labor Party came to office following a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and set things right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is vitally important because an <span class="highlight">election</span> for the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory will be held in about October next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, one of the first matters the Committee will consider is the constitution as it stands and it will endeavour to bring down a recommendation to this Parliament that it should give the people of the Northern Territory a fully elected Legislative Council at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party won quite a few seats at the following <span class="highlight">election</span> and I am sure that we will win quite a few more when the next <span class="highlight">election</span> is held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under this Bill the Government is trying to extend the life of the Assembly for another 12 months after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also said in his speech that he thought the fact that the Legislative Assembly had been made a fully elected body was the reason the Labor Party was decimated in the <span class="highlight">election</span> that took place immediately after. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the Legislative Assembly, the Administrator shall, by notice published in the Government Gazette of the Territory, appoint a time, being not later than 30 days after the day appointed for the return of the writs relating to that <span class="highlight">election</span>, for holding a session of the Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But of course we were bludgeoned into having an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They forced us to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They forced us to an <span class="highlight">election</span> again in 1975 by not passing the Supply Bills under which we could have financed the construction of this laboratory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises made by the Australian Government in 1975 was the establishment of a special Australian Rural Bank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We recall the large contingent of small businessmen who arrived on the steps of Parliament House before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I commend the Government for introducing this particular piece of legislation at this time, following the promises made before the <span class="highlight">election</span> in December of last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780608_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, when will we see legislation to set up a security appeals tribunal as promised in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically the honourable senator referred to the Liberal Party policy speech delivered during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and said that we were very proud of our past record and our future program in law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Minister equate these figures with the statement by the Prime Minister during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that unemployment could be expected to fall from last February? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inquire into and report upon whether, in the course of the re-distribution in 1977 of the State of Queensland into Electoral Divisions for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Members of the House of Representatives (including the change of the name of a proposed Division from ‘Gold Coast’ to ‘McPherson’) in so far as the re-distribution affected that part of the State of Queensland that, prior to the re-distribution, comprised the Division or McPherson, any breach of a law of the Commonwealth or any impropriety occurred by reason of: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding his success in securing pre-selection for Fadden and winning that seat in the December <span class="highlight">election</span>, he continued to raise the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy statement the Government foreshadowed various measures which will assist Australian manufacturing industries to take advantage of these opportunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will include the first instalment of the additional capital program announced at the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Originally, in 1975, a promise to establish a rural bank was incorporated in the Liberal and National Country parties ‘ <span class="highlight">election</span> program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For 22 months after it had been elected it did nothing but brought in this legislation and passed it in the week before the Parliament rose for the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1977 the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  returned to the Rural Bank for the purposes of his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy and said ‘that it would provide long term credit to viable borrowers for up to 30 years at concessional rates of interest’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the concessional interest rate mirage, which was shimmering before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, has now disappeared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking was clearly repudiated last Wednesday by the Minister for Primary Industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, this institution which started out as a gimmick in the coalition Parties’ 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span> program, to the degree, if any, it is not a gimmick, is now a complete captive of the Australian Bankers Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This then leaves us without any reason whatsoever for the existence of this Primary Industry Bank, except to provide a costly facade to save face for the Government which in two <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns made a major issue of the establishment of this institution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, what is the purpose of having the institution other than as a face saving gimmick for the Government and for the reckless <span class="highlight">election</span> promises which the Prime Minister made in November 1977 to provide long term loans at concessional rates of interest and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At an <span class="highlight">election</span> the view of the farmer organisations was repudiated by 73 per cent of the farmers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the euphoria of the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the Government promised to build a laborator)’ at Geelong- and, even though it will cost $ 100m, this is one promise that must be kept . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to correct the problem that arose during the <span class="highlight">election</span>- a problem that faced the then Treasurer,  Mr Lynch-  another ministry was subsequently created, that of Finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of these Bills goes back to late 1975 when the Liberal Party, which was then in Opposition, advised during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of that year that if it were elected to office it would introduce the new federalism policy and that that policy would mean that the States would be given the power to introduce a State income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was challenged to say whether this legislation would be introduced if he were re-elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a complete repudiation of a promise given by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  during the 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Liberal-National Country parties, if elected, would not interfere with Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a good deal of squabbling between the Liberal and National Country Parties on this issue, squabbling that is relevant to the impending State <span class="highlight">election</span> in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are in different parties, but of course the real cause of this unseemly squabbling between the conservative parties is that they are jockeying for position for the impending Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, I mention another senator whose term would normally have expired on 30 June but who left the Senate prematurely to contest a seat for the House of Representatives in the last electionRaymond Steele Hall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sorry that before the Senate rose for the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> I did not have the opportunity to say those words. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact,  Senator Sir Robert  Cotton was the first candidate in any <span class="highlight">election</span> in this country to be returned with a million votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the honourable senators on the other side of the chamber,  Senator Mulvihill,  had more than a million votes, but  Sir Robert  Cotton with almost one and a quarter million votes has had more votes in a single <span class="highlight">election</span> than has any other candidate in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of considerable pressure from various people I eventually gave way and stood for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that my continued re-<span class="highlight">election</span> over such a long period has shown that I have given sincerity and devotion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was Arthur Calwell who instituted a decent system of <span class="highlight">election</span> to the chamber on the basis of which a threshold development began. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detailed costings of the procedures involved in conducting an <span class="highlight">election</span> showed that the preliminary estimate was much too low. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-66-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the matter of East Timor family reunions, in February this year the Indonesian Government advised that final arrangements for a visit to East Timor by an Australian immigration team would be discussed after the Indonesian presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> which was held in late March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-66-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preamble let me say that a young constituent reported to me that, on finding her name was not on the electoral roll prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, although she had filled out a card, she was told by the officials: ‘Do not worry about voting this time.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-66-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have to report that, accompanied by honourable senators, I presented myself to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, that I advised him of my <span class="highlight">election</span> as  President  of the Senate, and that  His Excellency  was so gracious as to congratulate me upon my <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#debate-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No breach of a law of the Commonwealth or impropriety occurred in the course of the redistribution in 1977 of the State of Queensland into Electoral Divisions for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of Members of the House of Representatives <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780815_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provision of proportionate subsidies by the Australian Government to political panics and candidates in federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns and the disclosure of the amount and nature of assistance by corporations and individuals to these parties and candidates; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possibility of establishing fixed <span class="highlight">election</span> dates subject to a government retaining the confidence of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs by reminding him that the Government established an inquiry into the fuel industry under the chairmanship of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in furtherance of a promise made by the Prime Minister during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then a decision will be made whether they will have another council <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is nothing to say when the next <span class="highlight">election</span> will be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> and that report has been gathering dust ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This matter arose out of the <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Parliament of groups or representatives outside the two major political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns in 1974 and 1975, I was working at the meetings with the then Prime Minister of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780816_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, may I congratulate you,  Mr Deputy President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position which you now hold. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is fully consistent with the actions of a government which won an <span class="highlight">election</span> with the promise of tax cuts by holding out a fistful of fivers, and then immediately it brings in another Budget, the fistful of fivers disappears back into the Government’s collective pocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-38-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government undertook to establish such a corporation during 1978 as part of its policy outlined at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780817_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That factor in fact sets the tone for the subsequent <span class="highlight">election</span> results. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That motion, of course, was designed to maintain the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Liberal-Country Party government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the overall result of the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> was such that the State Government was returned, the question is certainly raised in my mind whether in fact there is such a thing as a fair distribution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One is entitled, therefore, to say that those who draw up the electoral boundaries have a much greater influence on the final result of an <span class="highlight">election</span> than perhaps they should otherwise have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s commitment to this legislation was confirmed by the GovernorGeneral in his speech to Parliament following the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the legislation had been referred to also during the Labor Government’s term of office and at the time of the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Since this is my first utterance of any consequence in this place I would like to congratulate you,  Mr President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> as  President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Budget painfully reminds us of commitments that were made, not only during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, but also throughout the past two and a half years: Commitments of jobs for all; a commitment of a revitalised economy which would give the business community hope to plan for the future; a commitment of no more expensive overseas trips; a commitment to give the States a better deal; a commitment to reduce income tax; and, most important of all, a commitment to work in the interests of the total Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I do so, I remind every senator of the promises which the Liberal and National Country parties made prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We were told that all that was needed was the re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government to set the whole thing in motion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find a consistency in this Budget that has been with us since the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Fraser Government and which  Mr Hayden  as Treasurer in 1975 acknowledged in the statement that I read out to honourable senators earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I offer my congratulations to you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to this high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I have no doubt that should honourable senators be minded to get on with the job, they will be much assisted in that process by your own courtly presence in the chair, and I join with other senators in congratulating you on your re-<span class="highlight">election</span> to that high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Taxes were to come down, and so they did for a few months until the <span class="highlight">election</span> was over. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before I make my contribution to the Budget debate I would like to congratulate you,  Mr President,  on your re-<span class="highlight">election</span> to your high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he looks at all these factors and at some other factors in the Budget which I shall mention at a later stage he sits and ponders and says to himself: ‘Where was all this in  Mr Fraser  ‘s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech, made just under eight short months ago? ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He realises, like many other people in the community, that these things were not in the <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech of the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the United States, when President Carter had settled down after his <span class="highlight">election</span>, he established a Metric Conversion Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it also true that the housing allowance scheme was included in the Government’s 1977 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign program and was referred to in the Governor-General’s Speech as one of the Government’s plans to ‘help those in need, increase opportunities and bring about greater social justice’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that these two bodies could make a major impact upon the advancement of scientific and technological development in Australia, can the Minister say what progress has been made in fulfilling these <span class="highlight">election</span> promises? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I take this opportunity from the floor of the Senate of congratulating you,  Mr Deputy President,  on your <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position of  Deputy President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was happy to support your <span class="highlight">election</span> and I look forward to years of association with you in that position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also congratulate, in his absence, the  President  on his re-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer firstly to the comment by Professor Charles Kerr on 7 February 1978, soon after his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the post of  President  of the Family Planning Association of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Several years ago farmers in Tasmania and their organisations rebuffed the attempts of the National Country Party to organise in Tasmania, so much so that  Mr Bill  Cassimatty, a man of very considerable farming expertise and political talent in Tasmania, declined to field a National Country Party team in the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great anomaly between the payment of pensions in this Budget and what was promised to pensioners during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns in 1975 and 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She even went so far in a Liberal Party <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement last December to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They promised that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, but now when they have two and a half years of government ahead of them they sweep away the benefits of these people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They thought that both the Minister for Social Security and the Prime Minister were genuine in making the statements, and no doubt many of them were influenced by them in the way they voted at the <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I consider that appointment to be as important as any other <span class="highlight">election</span> to any other committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This approach was adopted in connection with the 1977 Northern Territory Legislative Assembly elections and the last Federal general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>, approval to continue the operation ofthe Committee was given by the Minister for Social Security in April 1 976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was about to refer to a promise made by the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Minister was reported to have said in a Liberal Party <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement last December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If during an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the best economic advice is to restore incentive and give businesses and people the wherewithal to get the economy moving, is the position so different now? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy President,  I congratulate you on your <span class="highlight">election</span> for the first time as  Deputy President  of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also give my congratulations to  Mr President, Senator Condor  Laucke, on his re-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever they are preparing to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span> they should read The Sobering Story of Australia’s Big Spending’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1963, in response to very real electoral pressure, we had science laboratories offered as an <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick to independent schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One relatively minor problem that has not yet been solved is that of the holding of simultaneous elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a short term for the House of Representatives most governments- although admittedly certainly not this one- would be reluctant to put forward tough, long-term policies that they know to be necessary, because of the imminence of an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is made much worse if the already too-short interval between elections is further shortened by a separate Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposal on simultaneous elections that was put to the people last year, and rejected by them then, was produced by the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Review in 1959 and was endorsed by the 1976 Hobart Constitutional Convention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know of nothing in the theory of responsible government that necessitates giving a Prime Minister the power to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> at a time which suits his political advantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that would be needed would be to have a constitutional provision that if a government could not be formed in the House of Representatives there should be an <span class="highlight">election</span> for a new House of Representatives to complete the unexpired portion of the fixed term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to see this issue of simultaneous elections, through fixed terms of both Houses, go to a referendum at the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> without bringing in other issues, such as a longer term for Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to see the simultaneous <span class="highlight">election</span> issue stand or fall on its own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the matter of simultaneous elections is not an issue which should be swept under the carpet, just because it is not likely to be a problem in the near future, there are other much more important problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike any other second chamber, we cannot effectively be whipped into line by the threat of an <span class="highlight">election</span> or of abolition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average voter does not feel that voting for a kind of shopping list of proposals at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, some of which he probably does not agree with anyway, gives him any significant influence on the machinery of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, please accept my congratulations on your re-<span class="highlight">election</span> as  President  of this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each political party discloses its policies to the people at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a moral obligation for the elected government to carry out without changes its expressed policies until the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, I congratulate you on your re-<span class="highlight">election</span> in this chamber to your high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I do favour is that, in the event of a blocking of Supply leading to a deadlock between the Houses, the Parliament, including the Senate, should face the people in a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An aspect of this redistribution of the burden of recovery in this country which is even more disturbing is the fact that many of the Government’s actions are quite contrary to promises that it made to citizens very recently, certainly in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> and for some time since then. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, of course, it has imposed a tax surcharge on 1 1 per cent of the income of all taxpayers, thus wiping out for most taxpayers the tax reductions which were so famous or, should I say, notorious during the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If during an <span class="highlight">election</span>, the best economic advice is to restore incentive and give businesses and people the wherewithall to get the economy moving, is the position so different now? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would do  Mr Fraser  well in relation to unemployment to go back to his party’s predecessor, the United Australia Party, which in the run-up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1943 was putting forward a plan for a national insurance scheme on a contributory basis beginning with insurance against unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not want their money spent on these types of organisations, they know what to do about it; they can vote the Government out at that next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously there are some elements in the attitude of this Government as expressed then and now by the Minister for Primary Industry in common with pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> commitments to tax cuts and post <span class="highlight">election</span> tax increases; with preelection promises to provide funds at concessional rates of interest for agriculture; with unequivocal assurances’ given in 1974 again by the present Minister for Primary Industry that the nitrogen bounty would be maintained at $80 a ton although the Government now has legislation before the House to reduce the subsidy from $60, to which it reduced the bounty a couple of years ago, to $40. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it seems that the best way to ensure that a dam will be at least started is to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When he could feel an <span class="highlight">election</span> approaching he would say: ‘I can feel a dam coming on’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the specific questions which he has raised are concerned, it appears to me that, since limitations are contained in the Electoral Act with respect to expenditure which bear little or no relation to the amount which is spent on elections in Australia, that is a matter which may well require examination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those restrictions do not inhibit the amount spent on elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My personal wish would be that that discussion should take place as far away from an <span class="highlight">election</span> as possible so that we can get as dispassionate an examination of the Act as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 8 May 1974, which it will be recalled was during the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the Australian Country Party secretariat issued a Press statement on behalf of the then shadow Minister for Agriculture,  Mr Sinclair,  who at the time was in Mackay, a well-known sugar growing area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is noteworthy outlining what  Mr Sinclair,  the present Minister for Primary Industry, said in May 1974, just prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate of what he said on 8 May 1974, just prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can remember quite clearly the 1974 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time one of the major <span class="highlight">election</span> planks that some people were putting forward on behalf of the then Opposition was that if the people put the Labor Party back into government it would do away with the nitrogenous fertilisers subsidy, yet it is now actually being removed by the present Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not delivered an expanded nursing care benefit, which was promised during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, and now it has cut home care and welfare subsidies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In November last year, before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, we had before us a Bill which was similar to this one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, almost a year ago just before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> a Bill was rushed into the Parliament to extend the homeless persons assistance program from a three-year to a four-year program. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It would otherwise have come to a conclusion with the onset of the December 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780919_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is the James Kaldis of Kingsford, Labor candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the New South Wales Legislative Council, the James Kaldis who is active in the presentation of ethnic radio programs for the Special Broadcasting Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Service applies a policy consistent with that applying to the Public Service generally which requires candidates to resign from their positions prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was pointing out that in fact the Government could well have taken a page from the <span class="highlight">election</span> platform of the United Australia Party in 1943 when it was proclaiming what it would do once war ended, to wit, introduce a national insurance scheme, on a contributory basis, beginning with insurance against unemployment, immediately victory is achieved and peace returns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Housing approvals during July last were the lowest for over 1 5 years, which is an indication of the continuing slump in this activity and a contradiction of the Liberal Party’s mouthings at <span class="highlight">election</span> time on how it stands for the right of people to own their own homes, but of course talk is cheap. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage I wish to pay several tributes: Firstly,  Mr President,  to you on your re-<span class="highlight">election</span> to your high office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legitimacy of this Government at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> will rightly depend upon the success which it has demonstrated in solving this problem more than any other issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the Fraser Government’s repudiating an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise not to interfere with Medibank and its proceeding to dismantle it, he will save the $2 a week levy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For so long  Mr Dunstan  has done so many things and now, because we are nearing another <span class="highlight">election</span> perhaps in 1980 or 1981, he is starting to back away a little from industrial democracy and so many other things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications: Has any direction been given by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal under section 1 16 of the Broadcasting and Television Act forbidding the broadcasting of <span class="highlight">election</span> matter on radio or television by the New South Wales Branch of the Liberal Party between midnight last night and polling day next Saturday for the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in Werriwa? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it can win the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, which I seriously doubt at this stage because of the lack of popularity of the Dunstan Government, it is quite possible that the uranium enrichment development will get off the ground. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It envisages a five-year transitional period during which Israeli military forces will be withdrawn to garrisons in specified locations, and the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a self-governing authority with full autonomy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some 2,153 people were first told that it had been suggested that the Federal Government provide a fixed amount of money for the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of candidates for Federal Parliament and that all private contributions from other sources be prohibited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, no matter how well intentioned a political party might be, no matter how honest and even-handed its members might be, without public funding the imputation is there that that political party, especially while in government, will in one way or another serve the interests of business organisations and others which provided it with really large sums of money, particularly at <span class="highlight">election</span> times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me wrong that major political parties should have to vie with each other to obtain one way or another- one might almost say in any way, at any cost- millions of dollars at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is unfortunately true, based on the results of elections since television was introduced, that use of expensive television time will influence, to some extent, the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that while there is a very great and seemingly impelling and increasing need for large sums of money for advertising, especially at <span class="highlight">election</span> times, there must also exist a very great amount of temptation towards some kind of arrangement with a lavish donor of funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall very vividly a full page advertisement which appeared in the  Sydney Morning Herald  during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable senators that we are even reaching the stage where such huge advertising at <span class="highlight">election</span> time is becoming counter-productive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it is right and proper that there should be <span class="highlight">election</span> advertising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But surely it ought to be carried out under some sort of control, with impartiality, as our other <span class="highlight">election</span> procedures are carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe there is any corruption within the actual machinery of our <span class="highlight">election</span> system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ideally, advertising at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, which is right and proper since it is necessary that the public should be informed of what is going on at that <span class="highlight">election</span>, might present to the public the actual policies of the rival parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President and honourable senators, I suggest that this is necessary because at <span class="highlight">election</span> time the Press tends to regard policy from the point of view of what has news value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that we would then have a situation in which, instead of people being completely bewildered by what is going on at <span class="highlight">election</span> time, concerned citizens could have easy and systematic access to the policies of the various parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, in recent weeks  Mr Ellicott  has added to the confusion, first of all by putting out a statement saying that there would be held simultaneously a referendum with regard to the wishes of Australian Capital Territory citizens in respect of self-government and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for some form of legislative body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now the Minister has changed his mind and has offered a referendum to the community this year on the issue of selfgovernment and an <span class="highlight">election</span> for some form of self-government next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in the Werriwa electorate last Saturday, in which there was a massive swing to the Labor Party, despite the fact that  Senator Webster  said in this Parliament a few days ago that the Budget had been accepted by every person in the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Prime Minister was acquainted with some of the results of recent gallup polls, he said that the only poll he was interested in was the poll taken on <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Well, we had an <span class="highlight">election</span> on Saturday and what was the result? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Labor Party gained an increase of 1 1.6 per cent on its vote in Werriwa over that of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>, I said unemployment would fall from February and keep falling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When there is a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for that seat, because of what has gone on in the Victorian Government, there will be another massive swing to the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Ellicott  told lies in the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the result of the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> held in New South Wales last week and ask how many members from Western Australia we will have in the House of Representatives after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an <span class="highlight">election</span> or a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> were to be held in the immediate future  Senator Chaney  would find the results surprising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The votes polled at the various ballot boxes in the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span> showed definitely that the biggest swing to Labor occurred in those districts which normally vote Liberal and in the middle class districts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only one ballot box recorded a win for the Liberal Party candidate, and that was the ballot box which in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> recorded a four to one vote in favour of the Liberals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this by-<span class="highlight">election</span> it recorded only a two to one majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whereas previously he intended to persecute everyone, now that the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales has been held the story is a different one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is because there is to be a sensitive by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in the area of Ballarat in a month’s time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some honourable senators will recall that in 1977 one of the justifications for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>, although now, as a result of a royal commission in Queensland, we begin to hear others, was that the Government wanted additional muscle to stand up to militant unions in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told at the time that the Industrial Relations Bureau legislation would be part of this and that if the Government got a big vote in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> it would be proved to be right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He stressed the fact that at no time since its <span class="highlight">election</span> had the present Government pretended that there were quick and easy solutions to Australia’s economic problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot afford to break <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in such a sensitive area, especially in light of the fact that the Aboriginal infant mortality in Australia is as high as 98 per thousand in some areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When members of the Government were campaigning on the <span class="highlight">election</span> trail they said: ‘We will hook up Adelaide River, Newcastle Waters, Mataranka and Pine Creek’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is as futile to read its policies as it is to listen to the policy speeches or the promises made on the <span class="highlight">election</span> trail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I might say that that is a decision motivated by our public pledge before the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> that we would never vote against a Supply Bill brought forward by a government elected by a majority of Australians regardless of the political complexion of that government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It had to be a horror Budget because an <span class="highlight">election</span> was held last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will not be another <span class="highlight">election</span> until 1980. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  Government won the <span class="highlight">election</span> then, but it won the <span class="highlight">election</span> only because of all the false promises that are contained in this document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government repeated a lot of those promises in last year’s <span class="highlight">election</span> and now they are catching up with the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 had people come to me after the <span class="highlight">election</span> and say: ‘We voted for this man. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the electors of this country do not think it is too honest because at the first test of it, which occurred on Saturday last in the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, we found out how honest the people thought the Budget was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the Bass by-<span class="highlight">election</span> was held, which the Labor Party lost and in which the Government had a massive win, honourable senators used to complain every day that we should resign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was proved on Saturday in the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span> and it will be proved again as soon as we can get another opportunity for the people to go to the polls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir, Though we deserve a break from the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> indepth interviews, Lenore  Nicklin ‘s cosy chat with  Senator Susan  Ryan deserves some comment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canberra branch of the Women’s Action Alliance (a national body of concerned women) sent a questionnaire to all ACT <span class="highlight">election</span> candidates, seeking their views on indexation of family allowances . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the Prime Minister’s statement in Sydney last Monday that he had been advised prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that ‘Unemployment will fall from February onwards’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware of the claim made by the Secretary of that Association,  Mr Blunden,  which, if not saying so, at least implies that the claim made by  Mr Fraser  during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was in fact not a correct statement? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Blunden is concerned that the Prime Minister’s statement ‘reflected on the ability and integrity of the Public Service advisers who were in no way responsible for the electioneering promises made by  Mr Fraser  in the 1 977 general <span class="highlight">election</span> ‘, will the Minister refer the Press release to the Prime Minister and seek his comment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was in the chamber on Tuesday night when  Senator McLaren  was speaking about the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span> which was held last Saturday and I listened to  Senator Messner’s  interjections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am convinced that he is one Government member who does not even believe the figures of that by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps that is part of the reason that there was a vote in excess of 67 per cent in favour of the Labor Party candidate in the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span> last weekend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They expressed their concern on Saturday at the by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not given to quoting from documents of parties in opposition to my own but I have here one from the Westralian Secession Movement which was issued presumably, although I do not know because there is no date on it, when it was contesting the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have to admit to feeling that perhaps this Budget is the most disgraceful Budget that has ever been introduced or ever presented to a parliament of Australia; not only because of the retractions that have been made since it was introduced but also because it is the machinery by which a great number of pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises that were made in 1977 and in 1975 are being totally ignored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No matter how severe the economic circumstances, nothing will convince me that a government with any political nous at all would have introduced such a Budget in any year other than a nonelection year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The feeling of the Australian people was well and truly expressed at the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span> last Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no good the Government now saying that it is normal for the electorate to vote against the government in a by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These figures show that on quite a number of occasions when a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> has been held the swing has been quite substantially in favour of the government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other interesting point that these statistics show is that on perhaps six occasions there has been a swing in excess of 1 1 .7 per cent, which I believe is the figure which has been calculated as being the swing towards the Australian Labor Party at the Werriwa byelection last Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian Citizens of Polish origin, wish to bring to the Honourable Senators attention, the promise made by the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable J. M. Frazer,, in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech on November 21st 1977, when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the undertaking given during the 1977 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign by the Prime Minister that the Government would provide additional funds to ensure that the cost to parents of educating handicapped children should be no greater than the cost to parents whose children are educated in the usual government school system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking was one that jointly concerned  Senator Carrick  as Minister for Education and me, and our two departments have been working closely on a submission to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of being labelled a taxation debate, this debate should be called the ‘abrogation debate’ because the Fraser Government now has to reverse a number of the major promises it gave at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the Werriwa byelection showed and as the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> enforced, the path of this Government, that is the path of liberalism, is in retreat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The resounding swing in that by-<span class="highlight">election</span> and also the landslide victory in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales show clearly that the people of Australia are disillusioned by the string of broken promises and the inability of this Government to put the economy back on the road to recovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The breach of an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise and the imposition of what is labelled a ‘temporary increase’ in personal income tax will have adverse effects on consumer confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall that those tax cuts were the key issue on which the Government fought its general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to be hoped that at the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian people will remember the full page advertisements of the previous general <span class="highlight">election</span> and will realise that the bunch of notes which were shown in that advertisement as being the great inducement to vote for  Mr Fraser  was nothing more than a mirage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind senators that we speak about these items of legislation in the context of a government which in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> cynically exploited its proposed February taxation deductions for the purposes of that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the course of that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>More graphically, listeners will recall the advertisements of the Liberal-National Country Party Government in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in November and December last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Government became so disreputable that it lost the <span class="highlight">election</span> with such derision in the eyes of the public in December 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Button  rightly said, it would be a very popular government indeed which decided that it would go to the people in any <span class="highlight">election</span> process and declare that it would cut taxes or remove them altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In concluding my remarks, I would like to pay a tribute to those who have contributed to my <span class="highlight">election</span> as a senator for Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I acknowledge first of all that I would not be here without the support of the Liberal Party, including the staff and those on my pre-selection committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Canberra representative of the Adelaide  Advertiser,  when his opportunity came to ask a question, quoted to the Treasurer statements made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  prior to the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> in which the Prime Minister had followed his usual line and said that if Labor got back into government it would increase income tax and that everyone knew that that would be disastrous and therefore the people could not let Labor get back into government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as the increase in tax payable by the overwhelming majority of taxpayers- some 80 per cent- also operating is what  Mr Fraser  once called a massive unlegislated tax increase applying because of fiscal drag, because the Government has not adjusted the tax scales for changes in the consumer price index as it had solemnly promised to do prior to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government in its panic, knowing that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was looming, made massive and overgenerous changes to the averaging provisions for primary producers in a way which left them wide open to exploitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the Government since its <span class="highlight">election</span> in December 1975 has consistently been responsible to all Australian people in recognising that if our economy is not well and soundly based then we do not have a country with a soundly based future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet, with all the favourable conditions during this Government’s first two years of office it called an <span class="highlight">election</span> a year early. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was tragic to hear poor  Mr Coleman  in New South Wales say, even on <span class="highlight">election</span> night, that it was not the Federal Budget, or  Mr Fraser,  that was at fault. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the results of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> have intimidated senators opposite. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, those results have confirmed the result of the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span>, which was fought on federal issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That result was subsequendy confirmed at the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy for  Mr Fraser  to say that it was attributable to  Mr Wran:  It is nice and simple to say that he is a tremendous leader of great personal capacity and that that was the reason for the <span class="highlight">election</span> result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the reasons, I suggest, the Government is in difficulties electorally is that it has broken every <span class="highlight">election</span> promise on which it came to power in 1975 and 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It said that it was in favour of tax indexation but has shown that it cannot be relied upon to put into effect honestly its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My words were that this Budget gives the lie to the promises made by the Prime Minister during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign when he told the people that he would reduce taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We saw in its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise the Government handing out $5 notes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about the young couples who were hoodwinked by this Government not only at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> but also at the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> when it promised to give them assistance in buying a new home? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxation measures contained in these Bills which will be passed tonight or tomorrow will have a big impact on the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in Ballarat on the 28th of this month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government then repudiated its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises and imposed a levy of  Vh  per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been attacked as a going back on <span class="highlight">election</span> promises which related to the lowering of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781011_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That has been attacked as a going back on <span class="highlight">election</span> promises which related to the lowering of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main thrust of our complaint has been that there was an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that taxation would be reduced, but in the very next Budget the Government increased taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781012_senate_31_s78/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been thrown out of a job as Health Minister and Parliamentarian in 1 975 by a Governor-General and an <span class="highlight">election</span> and so I guess I know the sort of feeling this could bring about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it not the case that it has been widely known and acknowledged among United States political and agricultural writers for months that this legislation was essentially a domestic, political stunt motivated primarily by a desire to appease midwestern beef producers in the congressional <span class="highlight">election</span> due in the first week of November? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill runs contrary to promises made in two previous <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns when the Government went to great pains to reassure pensioners that they would not be disadvantaged by Government measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This renunciation of yet another <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge (plus the erosion of a commitment to ease the means test on pensions) has brought a heartening back-lash from the Government backbench - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is amazing that only such a short time after the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> I was forced to mention these things in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even such a short period after the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1977, promises made then have been broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was quite clear from that advertisement, which was part of the campaign to get this Government back into power in the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>, that the people of Australia, the pensioners of Australia, were led to believe that these six-monthly adjustments would continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So few of us thought in 1977 when the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was being waged that these words were so significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The record of the McMahon Government in doing what it did clearly exposes the duplicity of this Government in deliberately reducing the standard of living of pensioners by refusing to adjust pensions every six months as it said if would in its <span class="highlight">election</span> policy promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are expressing concern that <span class="highlight">election</span> promise after <span class="highlight">election</span> promise is being broken by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>but I think that, in a situation such as this, because of our responsibility to our electorates we have to stick firmly by what we said during difficult <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When we say something to somebody during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we cannot go back on what we say . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, there are not very many members of the Government who are prepared to admit that the pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises were just a ruse to get the pensioners and the thinking people in Australia to vote for this Government- vote it back into office to retain the Treasury benches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe  Mr Goodluck  can lay claim to that title because he sees the necessity of not just saying something to win government but that when government is secured to endeavour to make the party adhere to its pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators that this is one of the most conservative newspapers in Australia making the very valid point that this is yet another <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge being broken by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me just remind  Senator Walters  that, although she is claiming for the government credit for having introduced what she must have considered to be a rather sensational move, the Government of which she is a supporter had already committed itself to its introduction in a pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise in 1975 but did not even put it into operation until November 1977 when it was time for it to go back to the people of Australia and justify that pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government made pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise after pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise and is breaking them all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is breaking about six <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill represents a brutal assault on something like two million Australian men, women and children who are dependent in some way on social services; two million people whose standard of living lies in the calloused hands of this Government- hands that have become calloused because the Government has spent the last 34 months wiping its hands of every pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise it made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, there will be many opportunities for honourable senators to remind the people of Australia that this Government cannot be trusted prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> or whilst it is in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at some of the hypocritical statements made by honourable senators opposite and at some of the false promises made by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  back in 1975 during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and again last year during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was borne out in no uncertain terms, firstly, by the results of the Werriwa byelection and, secondly, by the results of the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span> held about eight or nine days ago when the Fraser Government got a massive rebuff for the way in which it was handling the economy of this country and for its treatment not only of the States but of the people in need. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already it has repudiated an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to maintain the twice-yearly pension increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, those occasions were the Werriwa by-<span class="highlight">election</span> and the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it does not do so, after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>- and this may come sooner than many of us anticipate because of the way in which the Government is carrying on- honourable senators opposite  will  be sitting back on this side of the House and the people of Australia will be able to rejoice because then there will be in office a government with some concern for the people in need in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle, in an <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement on 5 December 1977, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the statement set out in the Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say to the Minister now that the figure will be very greatly increased the next time these people get an opportunity to vote because I know that a great number of the 1 14 people who voted for Labor at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> are not pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also take into consideration the fact that  Mr Sinclair  made an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise at Alice Springs that if the Federal Government were returned to office last December special funds would be made available by the Federal Government for this purpose? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When this Government fought the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> it pledged to retain wage indexation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we are not today voting on whether the Government failed to keep an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much as we have sympathy with the Opposition’s point of view that this is another one in a long series of broken promises of the 1977 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, we believe that logically that is no reason to vote against this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign last year the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  was quoted as having said that a means test would not be imposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> the Government seemed reluctant to introduce automatic indexation until prompted by the Opposition and, I must admit, by the then Government backbencher,  Mr Chipp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle,  during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, said that pensioners had been daily knocking on her door and thanking her for taking politics out of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately after we won that <span class="highlight">election</span> instructions were given by the Prime Minister of this country, Malcolm Fraser, to my successor,  Senator Margaret  Guilfoyle, and her Department to scrap the promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was two months or two weeks or whatever after the <span class="highlight">election</span> results were announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, which is not a long time ago, there was not one mention of changing that indexation of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead there were constant references in the Liberal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that the Liberal Party was an innovator in this field of social reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has anything happened between the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1977 and the Budget in 1978 to warrant a breaking of this promise on such a massive subject? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I appeal to those Liberal senators who find a semblance of morality in the argument I have put forward today to vote against this overt breach of an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise on which many Liberal members won their seats, on which, perchance, some Liberal senators in the third position on the ticket won their seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us see what happened in 1970 when this guy first stood for <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is now sounding a warning to the Government that the pensioners will not vote for it at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if we could only dissect the figures of the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span> we would find that part of the disastrous result for the Liberal Party came from the pensioners because they are disgusted with honourable senators who sit opposite and who are led by  Mr Fraser  making false promises to the electors and trying to win their support. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say to honourable senators opposite here and now, as  Senator Chipp  has said, that they will not get the pensioners’ vote at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, because of this very measure, this very clause 6 in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It introduced legislation to perform this task before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it became obvious that the Government was calling an <span class="highlight">election</span> earlier than expected, the legislation was withdrawn. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the first opportunity after its re-<span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government introduced this Bill to remove the benefits that were previously available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Minister in the previous Labor Government,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, in 1975 made provision for nominations for <span class="highlight">election</span> of a staff representative or representatives on the Executive of the CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not so addicted to the <span class="highlight">election</span> of staff representatives to the executive of an organisation that I stand by it as a point of fundamental principle on which I would be prepared to go to the wall, but I think it is a principle which would appeal to the staff of the CSIRO. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important that the device which has been substituted for that principle of staff <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Executive should work, otherwise the situation ought to be reviewed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In addition, we are promised no extension to Western Australia of the FM service of the ABC, quite contrary to the promises that were being made at the time of the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It was accepted so much that the Prime Minister, in his <span class="highlight">election</span> speeches in 1 975 and again in 1977, even after he had made some modifications, said: ‘We are committed to preserving Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also interesting if one considers the promises made by this Government before last year’s general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span> we propose to take up this question as a matter of priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781025_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told in February of this year- in fact, we were also told in December of last year and November of last year during the general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- that this country could well afford a taxation cut. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This situation applies also to Mount Isa, where during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Premier advised the local people that if they did not re-elect their National Party member to the State Parliament he would cut off their water- he would not help them with the financing of a new dam or anything associated with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As has been well known, for the last few months several Bills have been floating around the United States Congress, the object of which, in this United States congressional <span class="highlight">election</span> year, was to impose, or seem to impose, further restrictions on the importation of beef to that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also fairly widely recognised that most of this political activity in the United States Congress could be described as political stunting, grandstanding by politicians who represented the cattle States and who, prior to the congressional elections of next month, were attempting to ingratiate themselves with their electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There can be no doubt that the legislation, which passed Congress before it rose for the November <span class="highlight">election</span>, will not be implemented irrespective ofthe actions of  Mr Sinclair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781026_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The promises that were made originally when the administrator was appointed- and there were two significant promises, one that the rolls would be updated and a local government <span class="highlight">election</span> would be held and the second that the leases would be finalised- have not come to pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The rolls are apparently completed but no date has been set for the local government <span class="highlight">election</span>, which in the normal course of events will take place in Queensland on the last Saturday in March 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is also, of course, a panic measure arising out of the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> results in New South Wales and Victoria in the last couple of months and the crushing defeat of the Liberal Party in the State <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Before the suspension of the sitting of the Senate I said that the Commonwealth’s agreement to the funding of development projects by way of loans raised by the States was a panic measure directly attributable to the Liberal Party’s crushing defeat in a Federal by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales, a State byelection in Victoria and, of course, the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was a precursor of the slogan that the Liberals used in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, something that referred to the lights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781107_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the decision of the Australian Government to depart from its 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that pensions would be increased twice-yearly in line with increases in the CPI, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We pray the Government will direct that this position should continue, and that the Minister will authorise the Commonwealth Electoral Officer to proceed with an <span class="highlight">election</span>, by all ABC staff, of a new commissioner, and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister’s failure to honour his 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to provide, through the Primary Industry Bank, long term credit at concessional rates of interest.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But by November, when the Bill actually appeared just in time for the <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Sir Samuel  had come up with a completely new set of requirements which included ‘facility for producers to approach the bank without first being referred by the trading banks’ and a ‘guarantee of increased skills of loan appraisers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Like other Australians, the farmers know now that the Prime Minister’s promises become inoperative each <span class="highlight">election</span> night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister has tried to divert attention from his dishonoured <span class="highlight">election</span> promise on interest rates by emphasising that money may be provided on long terms of up to 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this context the Government’s claim that the loan term is more important than the interest rate is almost as counterfeit as the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But whatever the justice or the wisdom of providing or not providing cheap credit for agriculture, there can be no justification for cynical pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> prime ministerial promises to deliver cheap money- promises which are inoperative as soon as the votes are safely in the ballot box. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party Opposition in this Senate has submitted as a matter of public importance ‘the Prime Minister’s failure to honour his 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to provide, through the Primary Industry Bank, long term credit at concessional rates of interest’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He promised tax cuts- we know that in this Budget tax has been increased; he promised in the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that unemployment would fall steadily during 1977- we all know that the figures that will come out this Friday will show that that promise has not only not been fulfilled but that unemployment will increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Naturally in 1977 when it was going to an <span class="highlight">election</span> the Liberal Party dangled a bait before the rural sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is not the argument that members on this side would have been prepared to advance when our own Government introduced for the first time the conscription of young men to go and fight in Vietnam following an <span class="highlight">election</span> at which there had been no issue about conscription and from which there was no conceivable way of saying that a mandate was given on one side or the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am saying, in a sense, that members of this chamber and of this Parliament went to the electors and were elected last year and therefore people are entitled to say that it was an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue insofar as we are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If my information is correct, at the last Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly <span class="highlight">election</span> abortion was not an issue at any time of any party or any candidate and no referendum has been held on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Legislative Assembly, which was not elected with this question as an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue, opts for free standing abortion clinics, does the Government - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One example is the recent survey conducted in New South Wales in respect of Premier Wran prior to the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results of that <span class="highlight">election</span> reflected exactly the results of that survey. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is little doubt that on the basis of the results of the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for Werriwa, also the New South Wales State <span class="highlight">election</span> and, subsequently, the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for Ballarat, the tide is turning strongly against the Fraser Government and against its supporting governments in the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As many of the political commentators have noted, the swing in all three elections has been uniform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those people who remember the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises of 1975 will recall that a dominant theme running throughout the Liberal-National Country Party coalition campaign was the notion of restoring confidence, of introducing stability, of conducting government with propriety and dignity and, above all and to quote the Prime Minister’s words, ‘to govern for all Australians’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt from the columns of political commentators and from the recent <span class="highlight">election</span> results that those people also expected the Government to perform and to bring about the positive changes which it claimed would be possible under the new economic management of the LiberalNational Country Party coalition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst it is important to remember the number of Ministers who have been removed from office under the Fraser Government and to concentrate on the broken <span class="highlight">election</span> promises, especially about reduced taxation, stability and economic recovery, it does not solve some of the more fundamental problems which confront this country at present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is given to Charlie Constituent or the elector to make his decision every three years but, let us face it, there is a long time between one <span class="highlight">election</span> and the next, even with the present Government, so he needs a watchdog in the form of his representative over what is happening in the Estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We ail know that some governments feel that an <span class="highlight">election</span> gives them a mandate to do almost anything and I have commented on this before in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I express my hope that if we had the numbers in the chamber to delay the passage of these Bills, that we would force the Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, to allow the people to make a judgment, as the present Government did in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 am confident that if we had the numbers in the Senate, as the then Opposition had in order to force the Government to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, that the judgment meted out to the Government in this year of 1 978 would be much harsher than that which was meted out to us in 1975, and goodness knows that was harsh enough. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In <span class="highlight">election</span> years the coalition Government probably gave them $ 1 or $ 1 .2 5 in an attempt to buy their votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twelve months ago, the Prime Minister called a general <span class="highlight">election</span> a year early on the pretext that he needed a renewed mandate to deal effectively with the major issues facing this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all have our differences with the Constitution, but it contains a provision that senators may not take up their positions until the end of the June following their <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the decision of the Australian Government to depart from its 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that pensions would be increased twice-yearly in line with increases in the C.P.I-, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present the <span class="highlight">election</span> statistics for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> and general <span class="highlight">election</span> of members of the House of Representatives held on 10 December 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>F. M. CHANEY, MINISTER FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, ON THE TABLING OF ‘<span class="highlight">ELECTION</span> STATISTICS’ AND ON ELECTORAL EDUCATION SERVICES, NOVEMBER, 1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Election</span> Statistics’ has been produced by the Australian Electoral Office and comprises 7 volumes, one for each State and one for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This book gives a most detailed breakdown of the <span class="highlight">election</span> results and will provide a basic reference for students of political science as well as for Senators and Members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, there is a tendency, I believe amongst all of us, to regard the Australian Electoral Office as an organisation which concerns itself almost solely with the maintenance of the electoral roll, the running of elections and the counting of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Election</span> Statistics’ forms part of the information and electoral education services which the Australian Electoral Office has been developing, particularly over the last two years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In keeping with the Government’s directives in relation to providing services for members of ethnic communities, the Australian Electoral Office has made wide use of ethnic radio and ethnic newspapers not only at the time of elections but also during non-<span class="highlight">election</span> periods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I have not been able to get the precise final figures on the advantages that accrued to the electors in the recent Legislative Council elections as a result of this change, I think it is true to say that fewer than 5 per cent of the voters involved voted informally under a similar method of voting to that which is used for Australian Senate elections except in relation to optional preferences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This represents the lowest percentage of informal votes recorded in an <span class="highlight">election</span> at large for a considerable number of years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have taken the time to look at the figures for the last three Senate elections, that is the double dissolutions in 1974 and 1975 and the <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results show a consistent pattern of informal voting at Senate elections, For example, in New South Wales in 1 974 the figure was 12.3 1 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have pointed to the reduction in the number of informal votes in both local government and State elections in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Labor Party Caucus does have an optional voting system for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of its officers and its executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the 1974 Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> there were 73 candidates for New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition, where such persons exercise the right of promotion appeal in relation to a Public Service vacancy, that action will constitute an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be covered by the new scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The establishment of the Bank and the provision of considerable government assistance enabling long-term borrowing with interest rates below those that would apply under commercial conditions brings to fruition the coalition parties’ <span class="highlight">election</span> commitments in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, they will have a voice in the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many exservicemen who in the past have stuck solidly to Liberal governments, because they have held the misguided belief that Liberal governments are the only governments that care about defence in this country and the only governments that are prepared to do anything for ex-servicemen, are going to have a change of heart at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What provision does the State or Commonwealth law, or the rules  of each private  fund, have for the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the governing board by contributors to the fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As honourable senators know,  Mr Sinclair  went so far as to say before the last <span class="highlight">election</span> that if re-elected the Government would build the road through from Alice Springs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Bishop’s  motion is worded in similar terms to a statement made by  Mr Sinclair  in Alice Springs prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The assurance was given in a pre-<span class="highlight">election</span> promise by a responsible Cabinet Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequently the Defence Department recommended the purchase of a third FFG, which was announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  just before the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the decision of the Australian Government to depart from its 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that pensions would be increased twice-yearly in line with increases in the CPI, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 1 1 November 1975 the inquiry was halted by the dissolution of Parliament and subsequent federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, but was resumed in March 1976 by the newly formed Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That amendment refers to the failure of the Government to fulfil the pre- 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise ofthe Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to provide funds at concessional rates of interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Government has persuaded a couple of people in the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council to support it in regard to this Bank, the fact quite clearly is that the great majority of farmers have not been fooled by the Government’s attempts to get itself off the hook for failing to fulfil the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Government spokesmen want to try to get the Prime Minister off the hook for the Government’s failure to honour his <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, or if they want to assert that the Government has in fact kept its promise, they should also explain why  Mr Sinclair  made that admission on 7 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Government’s attempt to escape from the embarassment of its failure to honour the Prime Minister’s 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, under this legislation it concentrates on the extension of the term of loan to a maximum of 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At end of motion, add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill takes no account of the Prime Minister’s 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to provide through the Primary Industry Bank long term credit at concessional interest rates ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> policy commitment of the Government stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a <span class="highlight">election</span> promise made by  Mr Nixon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister also take into consideration the fact that  Mr Sinclair  made an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise at Alice Springs that if the Federal Government were returned to office last December special funds would be made available by the Federal Government for this purpose? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now we find that  Mr Nixon  is trying to get  Mr Sinclair  off the hook by saying that  Mr Sinclair  expanded on the promise, but if he expanded on the promise he did not do so until after the Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> last year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the electors of the division of Grey and, I hope, the electors in the Northern Territory, will not forget those broken promises the next time they vote in a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, and they will not forget the episode which occurred in this Parliament last week when a motion was moved by  Senator Bishop  to get the weight of the Senate behind applications and representations that had been made to the Minister for Transport by all South Austraiian senators to have this special fund established and to get on with the work of reconstructing the Stuart Highway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As it seems to take this Government two or three years to respond to any positive proposal to help Australian exports and exporters, I am hoping that my reminder tonight will spur the Department of Trade and Resources and Cabinet to put some positive proposals to the Parliament before the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the decision of the Australian Government to depart from its 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that pensions would be increased twice-yearly in line with increases in the CPI, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to congratulate  Senator Scott  on his <span class="highlight">election</span> to the position of  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy President  of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I must record my thanks to the Liberals in Queensland for the support they gave me through the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether the changes we are seeing in the great swings in <span class="highlight">election</span> results over the last three years are not some early warning of the change. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For three years after his <span class="highlight">election</span> he served as Moderator-General of the Presbyterian Church of Australia and also for a period as a Vice-President of the World Presbyterian Alliance which has its headquarters at Geneva and a membership that is world wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the wheel were to turn the full circle, as it has in some other Parliaments, it could well be that after 1980 or the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span> the people who now sit on the other side of the chamber will be pleading for mercy from a Labor government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look back to the headlines in newspapers prior to the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> where people like  Mr Anthonythe  professional loud mouths of Australian politics- were promising that uranium mining would produce 100,000 jobs, we recall that sort of stuff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ethical implications of this kind of intent are in themselves serious since surely under our system of democracy it is basic that when a government loses the confidence of the people through an <span class="highlight">election</span> it also loses the right to influence the affairs of the nation in a decisive way as from that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also did not disclose the fact that this is a breach of a commitment given by the Liberal-National Country Party Government after the general <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 daresay that one of the major attractions during the course of that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign was the promise given by  Mr Fraser  that he would reduce taxation in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the fact that increases in the excise on beer and cigarettes is something which we have seen imposed by all governments over the years, the particularly reprehensible nature of these increases in indirect charges following the commitments given during the course of the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, only serve to illustrate that the undertakings and the promises given by this Government are totally unreliable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We gave to the grape growers a clear undertaking in our 1972 <span class="highlight">election</span> policy that if Labor was elected we would remove the excise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps they will have a change of heart at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the decision of the Australian Government to depart from its 197S <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that pensions would be increased twice-yearly in line with increases in the C.P.I., will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which is directed to the Attorney-General, relates to the sensitive question of the Australian nominations for the recent elections to the International Court of Justice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>972, that, contrary to the procedures recommended by the statute of the International Court, the Australian national group failed to consult either the High Court or the nation’s law faculties before making its nomination of candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> to the International Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, will the Attorney-General confirm that it was linked with the Prime Minister’s veto earlier this year, against the advice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of the possible candidature for this court of the former Prime Minister,  Mr Gough  Whitlam, this veto producing a situation where there was no potential Australian nominee with sufficient international stature to have a chance of <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the third and final amendment is to protect the position of a member of or candidate for <span class="highlight">election</span> to State or Federal Parliament who accepts an office on a council or the Executive Board of TUTA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-80-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An effect of sub-section (iv) is that any member of the Commonwealth or State public service who seeks <span class="highlight">election</span> to the Federal Parliament must resign his Public Service appointment prior to nomination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, if he is successful in the <span class="highlight">election</span>, he runs the risk of being declared ineligible to sit in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, it does restrict the ability of the public servant to contest a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The public servant, however, is required to resign his position before contesting a federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One important consequence of this situation is that there are probably many highly qualified public servants who could make a significant contribution to this Parliament but who choose not to seek <span class="highlight">election</span> because of the possibility of losing their livelihood in merely attempting to enter Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have previously outlined in this Parliament the limited opportunities for re-appointment to the Commonwealth and State public services for public servants who have resigned to contest a federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Prior to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the then shadow Minister for Social Security,  Mr Chipp,  now  Senator Chipp,  promised, as he said with the full authority of both coalition parties, that pensions would be immediately and automatically indexed to the consumer price index. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  promised that this policy would continue, as did the Prime Minister and, taking their cue from the Minister for Social Security and from the Prime Minister, as did every government member and supporter who campaigned in that <span class="highlight">election</span>, lt was a firm promise given to every pensioner and every beneficiary in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a television advertisement on 5 December 1977, just before the <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Minister for Social Security said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no question that this matter of indexation of pensions is one of the biggest things weighing in pensioners’ minds, and it is one of the biggest things which influences them on how to vote at <span class="highlight">election</span> time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore, it was included in the policy speech made by  Mr Fraser  at the time of the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what is being done, notwithstanding a firm promise by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> on which he must have won hundreds of thousands of votes- possibly millions of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was in 1 975 before the <span class="highlight">election</span> of that year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1977, just before the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was called 1 2 months early,  Mr Fraser  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  added to that statement during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1977 in an advertisement in which she featured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As an initial step to such a return to honesty in government I believe that this Government should immediately announce that it will revert to a six monthly adjustment of pensions because this is what the pensioners of Australia expected after the 1975 and 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should say to the Australian people, ‘We cannot have twice yearly indexation of pensions as we said we would at the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> and the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As honourable senators will recall, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  announced in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech last November that the Commonwealth would initiate a new program for urban public transport. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The States Grants (Urban Public Transport) Act 1978 honoured our <span class="highlight">election</span> policy commitment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He agreed to the legislation and the people in the electorate of Murray in South Australia vilified him so much that in the 1968 <span class="highlight">election</span> he lost his seat and the Labor Government was defeated in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contrary to what this Government is doing, it ought to be spending and allocating the sort of money to which it committed itself, through its Minister for Transport and its Leader, in both the 1975 and 1977 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is no wonder that the Australian people are losing faith in political parties and in governments when <span class="highlight">election</span> promises can be broken so glibly as though they have no value. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remember during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign visiting the railway workshops in Launceston and being ashamed of the fact that public facilities had been allowed to deteriorate to the extent to which they had. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether  Senator Peter  Baume is smiling at my reference, but he must surely recognise that one of the features of  Mr Wran’s  victories in the last two elections in the State has been his determination to improve the urban public transport system as far as the available money would allow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was in recognition of that need for improvements in urban transport that seats were won in the <span class="highlight">election</span> before last in the key areas of Gosford and the Blue Mountains, which brought about the defeat of the conservative government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Senate, of course, will very well recall that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  announced in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech that the Commonwealth would initiate programs for urban public transport and that these programs would provide something like $300m over five years to assist the States in upgrading their urban public transport systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>During the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Prime Minister said that Australia was ready to go with $6,000m worth of investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prior to the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>  Mr Anthony  and subsequently the Prime Minister made great play of the alleged $6,000m worth of investments which were about to be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a sum which is hopelessly inadequate to meet that to which the present Government committed itself in its 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> program, namely, ensuring that no person be denied legal aid because of lack of means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, following the change of government, which some of us regrettably cannot help but remember took place in the latter part of 1975, that base figure of 442, the increase in which had not had time to be implemented at the time of the <span class="highlight">election</span>, was reduced to 364, and it has sat there ever since. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the provision of proportionate subsidies by the Australian Government to political parties and candidates in Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns and the disclosure of the amount and nature of assistance by corporations and individuals to these parties and candidates; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the possibility of establishing fixed <span class="highlight">election</span> dates subject to a Government retaining the confidence of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first and most obvious reason why Australia needs to introduce some form of subsidies for political parties is that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigning in Australia has become a very expensive business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Labor Party a $12,000 cheque is not generally treated as petty cash and would certainly be a noticeable contribution to a House of Representatives candidate in any <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that most of the problems about which I have been speaking arise not because party officials and parliamentarians are inherently dishonest- at least not the vast majority of dedicated people on both sides of the political fence- but because of the difficulty of making ends meet in <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator, are you saying that the Liberals of New South Wales or Victoria have never paid people to work on <span class="highlight">election</span> booths in the past? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State aid for political parties takes several forms of which the most important is for <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign expenses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Payments are spaced over a period of four years, with the greater part being paid during <span class="highlight">election</span> years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A law introduced in 1967 lays down the rules for subsidy through grants advanced for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes based on the performance of the parties concerned at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Canadian Elections Act of 1974 introduced a system of financial aid to political parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Candidates are partially reimbursed for <span class="highlight">election</span> expenses if they are elected or receive more than 15 per cent of the total votes cast in their electoral district. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Houghton committee which was set up in Britain recommended that to qualify for a grant a political party, at the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>, must have firstly saved the deposits of its candidates in at least six constituencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recommendations continue: Secondly, as a party, it must have polled at least 150,000 votes and had at least one member elected in the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>; or thirdly, as a party, it must have had at least two of its candidates returned as members in the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example,  Senator Chipp  and  Senator Mason  might find it interesting that under a system similar to that recommended by the Houghton Committee, their party, the Australian Democrats, the newest party in Australian politics, would be eligible for a significant amount of state aid in the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, having established that their party is a popular force and that it had considerable electoral support at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Far be it for me to concede, after the events of 1975, that our present system of democracy is perfect, but the point that has to be made is that our system of government is one of representative democracy in which the people make a choice between the people and the parties that they want to represent them on the basis of the programs produced by those seeking <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790301_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the change of government came about statements were made by members of the present Government, including the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and various spokesmen, particularly during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, which I am sure led every Tasmanian to believe that this Government was maintaining the commitment made by the previous Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By that time a Labor government will be installed in Canberra and, as already indicated through my Party’s federal conference, that government will repudiate any new uranium sales contracts in the light of the lack of safeguards, in the light of inadequate consultations with the affected communities and in the light of the failure to implement promises to protect the environment and to establish national parks, matters which were expressed clearly in policy considerations for the 1975 and 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaking of apologias, when talking about the Land Sales Development Commission which the Victorian Government brought into being to oversee government purchases of land, one cannot help but remember that that Commission came into effect only after the Ballarat by-<span class="highlight">election</span> was held and the State Premier said that it appeared that they would have to look as though they were doing more about the land scandals and as though they cared more about the people of Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that only last week, in the <span class="highlight">election</span> build-up, the Victorian Minister for Housing said that he had directed the Housing Commission to buy back properties from people who wanted to sell them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the heat and the exposure of an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, even he is starting to feel doubtful about the role of the Housing Commission and whether it should be selling houses or building houses for people to rent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have done so purely because they think that the main thing that is going to occur next month is a Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> and they want to direct the attention of this chamber to try to get some cheap publicity for their action in Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My mind goes back to the period of the early 1950s- about 1954- when the Menzies Government, after it had been in office for a mere five years, was under challenge at a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Instead of the drama of the <span class="highlight">election</span> being whether the old age pensioners of this country would receive a pension free of the means test, the drama of the day became whether members of the Labor movement were engaged in political sabotage or espionage in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware of reported statements by the former British Prime Minister,  Sir Harold  Wilson, that, provided they were satisfied that the results of the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> in Rhodesia reflect the wishes of the majority of black and white Rhodesians, Britain and the United States should recognise the postelection government and that Britain, the United States and independent black African states should send observers to the elections in April. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this stage no Western governments, including Britain and the United States, have advocated sending official observers to monitor the Rhodesian elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then Prime Minister recalled that in his policy speech of 29 April 1974 he had given an undertaking that the Government would, if returned, appoint a judicial inquiry into the structure of the Australian security services, and the methods of reviewing decisions adversely affecting citizens or migrants and he said that the commission given to  Mr Justice  Hope would fulfil both parts of his <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Malcolm Fraser is stunting again in order to get his friend, Dick Hamer, off the hook and in order that his friend, Dick Hamer, might in turn get him off the hook when his particular problem arises and when he has to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It makes this statement made tonight look ridiculous because in October 1977,  Mr Anthony  was suggesting in this Parliament that what the Government needed was an early <span class="highlight">election</span> so that it could get the unions under control and this sort of problem would never arise again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has opened the United States to a tremendous influx of beef to keep domestic prices down simply because- I remind  Senator Baume  of this- a presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> is coming up and he wants to keep his cost structure down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I submit that as soon as this presidential <span class="highlight">election</span> is over we will be in a situation in which, because of the powerful United States lobby, many of these beef markets could be lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  gave a number of unequivocal guarantees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is still stuck with the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">election</span> boast that a 2 per cent interest reduction is a target that can and will be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fraser  may be hesitating because of the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span> next month. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not sure whether the Melbourne  Age  was suggesting that  Mr Fraser  would behave responsibly if he knew what the responsible part was, but of course  Mr Fraser  knows very well- as do most of his back benchers- that his back benchers are going to depose him as leader before the end of the year if the Hamer Government loses the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An announcement will not even be made until after the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span>, at the very least. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I dare say that the Prime Minister’s time horizon does not extend beyond 5 May because he knows that his survival as leader of the Liberal Party depends on whether the Victorian Government is defeated in the coming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, I am told that there may be no Leader of the Opposition because after the Parliament is dissolved and until the <span class="highlight">election</span> there may not be someone who, in actual statutory terms, is a Leader of the Opposition or he may have died and his successor may not have been appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At Aurukun, where the council had previously been dismissed, four of the five previous councillors who ran for re-<span class="highlight">election</span> were elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of one, because of postal voting is still in doubt and two appear to have been defeated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last week  Senator Bonner  told us about the wonderful <span class="highlight">election</span> in which Aboriginals could elect their own delegates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 3 1 March of this year local government elections were held in a number of areas in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal Party, my party, contested that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was a fair and square <span class="highlight">election</span> and these people are waiting for the postal and absentee votes to be counted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The elections at Aurukun and Mornington Island were also held on 3 1 March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To some extent the same anxieties are present because the <span class="highlight">election</span> result cannot be determined absolutely as there is a ‘cliff hanger’ situation there with the counting of votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that three additional councillors have been elected to local government so that when one looks at the <span class="highlight">election</span> of four out of five of the previous councillors at Aurukun and five out of five of the previous councillors at Mornington Island who have been re-elected to the councils of both of these communities, it surely proves to us in this chamber that negotiations between the Commonwealth Government, through the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, and the present Minister, Fred Chaney, have been successful. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of the elections have still to be declared at both communities and the <span class="highlight">election</span> of two candidates at Mornington Island still depends on the outcome of postal votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How unhappy was  Senator Cavanagh  tonight at the fact that there seems to have been an effective <span class="highlight">election</span> in both those communities giving the people the councillors that they wanted and, in some places, the councillors which they had previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and follows the question asked earlier tonight by  Senator Young  concerning the <span class="highlight">election</span> in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are we to take his statement that there will not be peace until all parties agree to mean that even if it were established that a majority of eligible citizens within Rhodesia/Zimbabwe voted in the <span class="highlight">election</span> and that a majority voted for the party of Bishop Muzorewa, the Australian Government would not accept that government as a valid one as long as any group of armed insurgents was prepared to bring down that government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister not agree that in relation to this matter the Government and other Western governments will need to say soon and quickly whether or not they believe that a valid <span class="highlight">election</span> has been held? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790501_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the outcome of Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span> in Victoria may well determine whether the policy of State income taxes, introduced by the Federal LiberalNational Country Party Government, will be proceeded with or whether it will receive the death blow it deserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let there be no mistake either about the fact that the re-<span class="highlight">election</span> of the Liberal Government in Victoria will give the green light to  Mr Fraser  to pursue his declared intention of seeing State income taxes introduced in all States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By contrast, the <span class="highlight">election</span> of a Labor government on Saturday in Victoria will be a clear signal to  Mr Fraser  that the Victorian people will not accept State income taxes in their State, because the Australian Labor Party is firmly opposed to this form of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Upon his <span class="highlight">election</span> as Premier of Victoria he will add another voice at future Premiers Conferences against State income taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We can always tell when there is in the offing somewhere on the continent of Australia a State or Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, because the same written speech, read so slavishly word by word, is made by  Senator Wriedt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surprise, surprise- a Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held on Saturday and out he trots with the same words today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to recall that prior to the New South Wales <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Senator Carrick,  in supporting  Sir Eric  Willis, delivered almost the same speech as he has delivered today, prior to the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In addition to the other matters which Victorians have to weigh up in any forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>, they have to consider that matter as a matter of fundamental importance to their own well-being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A lot of his speech revealed to me a chronic anxiety state about the Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> which is due on Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Wriedt  made clear right from the word go, he was taking this opportunity to exam.ine the political situation in Victoria shortly prior to an <span class="highlight">election</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, the Australian Labor Party candidate for Dromana made some casual promises during the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign about a coastal management authority and what Labor would do in relation to grants to local councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only in two of the 10 seats created was there any chance for the Australian Labor Party in any normal <span class="highlight">election</span> to have its candidate elected whatever the vote, unless there were a landslide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 say advisedly that we are not convinced that with the selection of the Commissioners that  Senator Chaney  has referred to on behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services,  Mr McLeay,  there necessarily will be a better result. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Despite  Mr Fraser’s  frequent statements that he would not hold a general <span class="highlight">election</span>, we all know that the whole purpose of the speed-up that took place in 1977 was to get the redistribution off the plate and to get the procedures formalised so that the Government could have a double dissolution and hold a general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the last <span class="highlight">election</span> in Queensland the Labor Party polled 42.83 per cent of the votes and got only 23 seats, which in actual terms represents only 28 per cent ofthe votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 can recall that during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1977 when I raised the matter the  Deputy  Prime Minister created the impression in the minds of journalists through various statements that the Cabinet submission dealing with the mining of the Barrier Reef did not exist, or that it did not recommend any exploratory drilling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because that statement was publicly disclosed prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span>, it was not dealt with at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-2-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As this undertaking was quickly dishonoured and has caused grave hardship to many thousands of pensioners in all categories, will the Minister give an undertaking that the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise will be honoured in the August Budget this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Prime Minister in his 1977 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech state that the Government’s objective was to move towards an allocation of up to two per cent of personal income tax collections for local government over a three year period? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the ratio existing in 1979 still the same as it was before the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span>, namely, 1.52 per cent of personal income tax collections? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We had an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1 977, and in the policy speech leading up to that <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government gave no indication that it was going to reverse the policy in its next Budget and cut out the May pension increase. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This has been the result of several factors, including changes in the Committee’s membership following the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>, the pressure of other important references and a decision in October last year to seek further submissions on this reference in order to provide an opportunity for wider participation in our deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I hope that the ABC inquiry will be a serious one; that it is not simply a strategy by which the Government hopes to defuse the ABC situation as an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Undoubtedly it would have been an <span class="highlight">election</span> issue because of the savage cuts and other treatment by the Federal Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all remember that in November 1975,  Mr Fraser  promised, as part of his <span class="highlight">election</span> manifesto, that the PJT would be abolished. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I guess that even the Prime Minister recognised this when he did not overtly implement his 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to abolish the Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>During the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the then caretaker Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, indicated quite clearly that he would abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore it is not surprising that an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal was not fulfilled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As  Senator Cavanagh  has pointed out, it would be remiss of us Opposition senators if we did not continue the debate on this statement tonight, in view ofthe fact that, on behalf of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  the Minister for Social Security made a statement in this chamber tonight to the effect that Medibank is to be completely destroyed, despite the fact that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  gave a categorical assurance in the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- it was one of the main points of his platform- that Medibank would not be interfered with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790524_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point that I am making is that it might be a good political tactic, but we should consider what it does to business confidence if rumours are circulating and the columnists of daily newspapers and the weekly newspapers are speculating that an <span class="highlight">election</span> could be held 12 months early. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>2 on the ticket if there is to be a joint Liberal-National Country Party ticket for the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>: We all know of the reason why honourable senators opposite are trying to say: ‘No,  Senator Webster’s  job is not on the line’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year the forty-sixth Parliament of New South Wales sat on 7 November following the <span class="highlight">election</span> and rose a matter of weeks ago having sat for a total of 4 1 days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the average taxpayer in the community has the message and knows that the Government has broken all the <span class="highlight">election</span> promises it made in 1975 and 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  speech is the type of speech of which we will hear many in this Senate until the pre-selection ballot is held in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To try to enhance his preselection chances he had to launch a real diatribe of nonsense against the New South Wales Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we look at the task in front of  Senator Puplick  we find that three Liberal Party senators from New South Wales will come up for <span class="highlight">election</span> at the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> results in New South Wales we realise that one of those senators has to miss out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Without a shadow of doubt three Australian Labor Party senators from New South Wales will be returned at the next half Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The three senators from the Government side who will face re-<span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia are the  President  of the Senate, the previous  speaker, Senator Davidson,  and  Senator Jessop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course the  President  is prohibited from making any preselection speeches in this place but we can expect to hear a few from  Senator Davidson  and  Senator Jessop. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the proceedings of the Senate were being broadcast last night  Senator Jessop  launched his campaign for pre-selection by trying to convince any of the people who might have been listening to him- I understand there were quite a few because I have received a few messages today to which I will refer- about funding for the Stuart Highway in the mid-north of South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of these messages I have received today were not complimentary to  Senator Jessop  so I do not think he did his preselection campaign any good by the way he behaved here last night. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, I remind the Senate that in the policy speech put down by  Mr Fraser  on 2 1 November 1 977 for the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span> he had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate will also recall that in the course of that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign electors were invited to dial you tax cuts’, that is, they were invited to telephone the Liberal Party of Australia, which would tell them what it would do for the Australian taxpayer in terms of taxation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will then see how she gets on in the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his policy speech on 2 1 November 1977, during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the Prime Minister stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, in a statement made on 7 December, he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was in 1976, if you please; it was not the 1979 show-  thc Government has honoured its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise to mainlain spending on essential education programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that is borne out in the results of last Saturday’s <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Australian Capital Territory where there was a 20 per cent swing to the Labor Party candidates and a similar swing against the Liberal Party candidates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Forty-six per cent of Australian electors would vote for that ALP and 43 per cent for the coalition if a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> were held this month, according to the poll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The poll was taken on the first two weekends of this month, immediately following the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where was the economic responsibility when Fraser made his <span class="highlight">election</span> promise in 1975 and 1977? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about the Government’s <span class="highlight">election</span> promises in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was so incensed with the Budget that the Government brought down that he published in his article on page 5 a photograph of the Prime Minister and reproduced one of the <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only a few moments ago I quoted from an <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement where the Prime Minister said that if electors voted for the Liberals on <span class="highlight">election</span> day in 1977 they would get lower income taxes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under  Mr Fraser’s  photograph there is this <span class="highlight">election</span> advertisement: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Every <span class="highlight">election</span> promise has been broken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I gave the heading of the article, but he is so excited about having to face up to broken promises, untruths and that sort of thing that have been uttered by members of the Government and himself during the <span class="highlight">election</span>, that he cannot take it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think I have proved to the Senate again that the people who sit opposite handle the truth very carelessly when it comes to <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister and a number of other Ministers indicated following their <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975 that full tax indexation would be introduced, and that it would apply not only to personal income tax but also in industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once-a-year payments strikea cruel blow to their expectation and make a mockery of a solemn <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 20 of the Bill requires that this mandatory question be asked of all people presenting themselves to vote: Have you already voted here or elsewhere in this <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government plans to insert this mandatory question into the relevant Act: Have you already voted here or elsewhere in this <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not necessarily in order of declining knavery, we have firstly,  Mr O’Driscoll,  a prominent Liberal Party member and resident of the Kimberleys, who, during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, lied to the presiding officer at the GoGo booth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keith Alan Ridge, the successful Liberal Party candidate in the disputed Kimberley <span class="highlight">election</span>, complained six days later about having to spend the last two weeks of his campaign among Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the Act is amended in the forseeable future, I would have no intention of standing for <span class="highlight">election</span> again in Kimberley because I believe that within three years there could be in the order of 4,000 Aborigines on the roll and I am sure you would agree we would be fighting a lost cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can foresee that unless this is done, there could be anything up to 4,000 Aborigines on the roll at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and, under these circumstances, the Liberal Party would probably be fighting a lost cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally,  Mr Smith  made the <span class="highlight">election</span> void on those and on other grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that if an illiterate person or- perhaps to use a less offensive expression- an Aboriginal who cannot read or write English wished to get a postal vote for a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, he would not be able to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would put very squarely before the Senate the suggestion that we have a great obligation to ensure that Aboriginal people, and other disadvantaged people, know what to do when <span class="highlight">election</span> time comes and how to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the elections some people were saying that Aboriginal people wouldn ‘t vote or that they shouldr ‘t vote because they didn’t understand what was going on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Election</span> Office - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say ‘Well done, <span class="highlight">Election</span> Office! <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of information has been put before the Senate, including extracts from the judgment of  Mr Justice  Smith relating to the Kimberley <span class="highlight">election</span> which gave rise to the Kimberley by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them was that after the <span class="highlight">election</span> which was challenged, the Commonwealth and the State in co-operation mounted an electoral education campaign in the Kimberley area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a joint Commonwealth-State effort and on all reports that I have been able to obtain it eased substantially the conduct of the voting in the subsequent by-<span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly <span class="highlight">election</span> the Australian Electoral Office believes that it is significant that there was a reduction in the informal vote from 5.08 percent to the total vote in 1974 to 3.18 per cent of the total vote in 1 977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, I think that that indicates that one can get over some of the sorts of difficulties which gave rise to the Kimberley by-<span class="highlight">election</span> by having a better educated, better equipped and better prepared electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that because I think it is very easy to say: ‘All right, I am going to read the report of the Court of Disputed Returns on the Kimberley <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever one wants to argue about the reality of manipulation in a particular circumstance in a particular <span class="highlight">election</span>, the fact is that the voting of people who are not able to read and write is open to manipulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 November 1977, which it will be recalled, was just prior to the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Prime Minister replied to a letter dated 10 November 1977 from  Mr Gradwell,  as the Prime Minister put it, ‘concerning the attitude of political parties to their role as potential employer of Australian Government Employees.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of that letter the Prime Minister gave a certain undertaking relating to the principle of wage indexation, an undertaking he made in general terms in <span class="highlight">election</span> promises prior to the 1975 and 1977 elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was in November 1977 shortly prior to the <span class="highlight">election</span> when, for example, the taxation cuts which all honourable senators- or perhaps I should say ‘ all senators ‘ in this context- will recall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the <span class="highlight">election</span> we propose to take up this question as a matter of priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is implicit in the statement and the letters that I referred to that at least at the stage prior to the last <span class="highlight">election</span> it was the Prime Minister’s view that that situation would continue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, as  Senator Button  pointed out, it is retrenchment in blatant breach of the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in November 1977 when he said, in that letter of 25 November 1977, which was tabled by  Senator Button: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report was published just prior to the last Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said during the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that he would not interfere with Medibank, that his party realised we had to look after the ill, the sick and the needy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we go back to the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign we see that both of the major parties promised support for the upgrading of State main lines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is not dead; he was defeated in an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the persons who lead the new regime in Ghana apparently have announced that they will be holding some form of <span class="highlight">election</span>, will the Government insist that the same criteria be applied to Ghana as are being insisted upon in the case of Rhodesia and that no recognition will be granted to the new government until such time as internationally supervised, free elections have been held in Ghana? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is not the case and recognition is granted to Ghana during the period that the Parliament is in recess, for the benefit of those of us who find these events a little difficult to follow, will the Government prepare a list of those countries where a change of regime can be recognised only after the holding of internationally supervised, free elections and those countries where this is not necessary? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out briefly that in December 1972 the Whitlam Government announced in a preelection speech that pre-school education would be made available within six years to every child. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In December 1975 the present Government came to office, although there had been an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the meantime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal-National Country party’s <span class="highlight">election</span> policy of that time stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have raised this matter, as I have on four other occasions, to endeavour to persuade this Government to honour its responsibilities and the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise that it made in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If he looked at the situation that occurred in the <span class="highlight">election</span> that took place recently in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia he would find that 4 per cent of the white minority in that country had 28 per cent of the votes in the lower House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask him whether he remembers the Prime Minister, during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, on 25 November to be precise, saying: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time and again during the 1975 and 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns, the Government parties emphasised that they were the low tax parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the circumstances, is it any wonder that, since the Prime Minister’s credibility is at its lowest level since his <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975, the Australian people have the greatest doubts as to the integrity and genuineness of this man? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 November 1977, during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, on the subject of taxation generally the Prime Minister said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me talk for a moment about taxation because it has become the major issue of this <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the question of tax indexation, we see that the Fraser Government has reneged on its <span class="highlight">election</span> promise in two respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, the Government and particularly the Prime Minister said- during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns he says these things- that governments have to be kept honest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister said during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that ‘the public has a right to know when taxes are being raised and governments should be subject to the financial discipline of introducing explicit legislation to this end’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject of tax indexation was raised also during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister always becomes most self-righteous on this question during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people remembered that in the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Most members of the chamber will recognise that today an <span class="highlight">election</span> has been called in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see that Premier Corcoran has decided to call this <span class="highlight">election</span> on the following basis: He says that he wants South Australians to confirm him in office so that he can put before them a package of policies to carry the Australian Labor Party, not the people of South Australia, into the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was asked by journalists at his set-up Press conference whether his calling of an <span class="highlight">election</span> on the day after the Federal Budget had anything to do with the Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘No, the <span class="highlight">election</span> has nothing to do with the Federal Budget, but, yes, the Budget will be an electoral issue ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apparently moved by the same sentiments as Opposition senators have expressed today, he is calling an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a press conference today  Colonel Corcoran  said that he had been contemplating an <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia for some time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He came to office last February on the resignation of  Mr Dunstan,  saying he would not have an <span class="highlight">election</span> for three years; that he wanted the State to consolidate so that it could recover from a disastrous state that had been created even though Labor had been in office there for almost 10 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Labor does not gain office next <span class="highlight">election</span> then by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He was already admitting, apparently, that his party could not win the next <span class="highlight">election</span>-  we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do it in a totally amateur way, I might say; but, belonging to a political party that is impoverished, the only way we can propel ourselves in <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns is to have my notorious face exposed on the streets on Saturday mornings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should not because people will think that I am either burying him or praising him now that the <span class="highlight">election</span> announcement has been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Once-a-year payments strike a cruel blow to their expectation and make a mockery of a solemn <span class="highlight">election</span> pledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, since a South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> is to be held and we are tender about that, let me remind honourable senators that the great and total critic of the uniform taxation system of the Whitlam Labor Government was the former <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The result of the Tasmanian <span class="highlight">election</span> and the inevitable results of the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> demonstrate that not only have State governments rejected the policy but that the people in the States have done the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the recent Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> Premier Hamer made it clear that he would not impose a second income tax. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now he is facing an <span class="highlight">election</span> and it is likely that any interest he had in a State income tax will have ceased. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The possibility of double taxation was instrumental in the defeat of the New South Wales Liberal Government in 1 976, but an even more damning criticism of the policy came in the recent Tasmanian <span class="highlight">election</span>, which was fought specifically on this issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let the Liberal Party in South Australia at this coming State <span class="highlight">election</span> go to the South Australian people on the basis of a State income tax implementing Federal Liberal policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What one has to watch is something very simple:  Mr Corcoran  wants to get an <span class="highlight">election</span> under his belt because he wants to put up a wide range of taxes and charges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having heard yet another harangue from  Senator Carrick  on the subject of Fraser federalism, I have a proposition to put to himthat he ask  Mr Tonkin,  the South Australian Liberal Party leader, whether  Mr Tonkin  will give  Senator Carrick  an invitation to participate heavily in the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign and to preach the virtues of a double income tax on behalf of the Liberal Party during that <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A number of extravagant claims were made about federalism before and after the 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the same  President  who is prepared to do this now has announced his retirement from the Senate as from the next Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He should have prefaced that question by saying that, in case the electors of Murray Bridge do not know it, there is to be a State <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three related events have sparked off new rumours of an early <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As this matter has progressed the left wing finally has forced  Mr Corcoran  to a State <span class="highlight">election</span> some 18 months early. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is only a few weeks ago that the Premier,  Mr Corcoran,  made it perfectly clear that he had no intention of going to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I was saying,  Mr Corcoran  has been forced into an early <span class="highlight">election</span> by the left wing of the Labor Party in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is absolutely no doubt that it is using him as a front for the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt what will happen is that he will be deposed by the left wing because it will have an increase in numbers after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Corcoran should not allow himself to be used as an <span class="highlight">election</span> tool by the radical left wing of the South Australian Labor party on an issue that is so vital to South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All he is doing is allowing himself to be used in the hope of winning an <span class="highlight">election</span> for his party, knowing full well that the left wing will take control straight after the <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind the honourable senator that at lunch time today Des Corcoran, at a tremendous meeting in Adelaide, delivered his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was interested in the ALP theme for the current <span class="highlight">election</span>, namely, ‘Follow a leader’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must admit that I really did believe that the Government was quite serious in its endeavour to get before the chamber an urgency motion which was not connected with the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This motion has been brought on quite deliberately by Government senators from South Australia to somehow bring some credibility to, or improve the flagging support for their party in the forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is perfectly obvious that it does not matter what a Federal member of parliament from South Australia does in this chamber in a debate on an urgency motion such as this as there is no way in which it could alter the course of the <span class="highlight">election</span> on 15 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet the Government parties do not rely on the issue of uranium to fight an <span class="highlight">election</span>; they rely on other issues which would be less likely to lose them an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can be trusted on one thing, that is, to win elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have a rather cute way of ensuring a win at a democratic <span class="highlight">election</span>: They lock up all their political opponents during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What a misleading advertisement, which confuses people in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign- as though it would have some real impact. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He talked about advertising by the present Premier of South Australia,  Mr Corcoran,  being misleading but did not tell us about the misleading advertising during the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Messner, as did  Senator Young,  today used the forms of this House to try to promote  Mr Tonkin  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of that electorate had never heard from  Senator Messner  or Chick Hanson after the latter was defeated in that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Corcoran  ‘s honesty, which must be in question, after leading us all to believe that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was not forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all we know he might be a candidate this year because as you would know,  Mr President,  the Liberal Party in South Australia was caught with its trousers around its ankles when the <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Corcoran  ‘5 honesty, which must be in question, after leading us all to believe that an <span class="highlight">election</span> was not forthcoming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the person who said that he would not go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>, that he would not refuse a Budget when we were in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, as soon as he had unloaded  Mr Snedden,  he went to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberals in this very chamber forced us to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They again forced us to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in 1975, and in 1977 they again went to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, they had three elections in the space of four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was no Legislative Council <span class="highlight">election</span> the last time that the House of Assembly went to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In successive elections since 1970 they have given their decision at the ballot box, and they are going to give the same decision again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I saw  Mr Tonkin  when he was interviewed on the night that the <span class="highlight">election</span> was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government is giving away our natural resources because in some areas- we would be hard put to prove it- it is getting some kick back to run its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike the Fraser Government, which has broken every promise that it has made since 1975, the Labor Government honoured every promise that it made prior to the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span> except for those promises which this chamber would not allow it to honour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators are well aware of the trauma that went on in this place and how we were forced to an <span class="highlight">election</span> in May 1 974 and again in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Half the people in this chamber had been elected before the 1 972 <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Withers  said in this chamber, the night after the <span class="highlight">election</span> results were known they set about formulating a policy to get rid of the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Is this the same  Mr Pickering  who contested an <span class="highlight">election</span> in the Australian Capital Territory as an endorsed Liberal Party candidate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was plain that if the Government did not re-introduce indexation it would be at peril at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this Government now willing to undertake voluntarily what it forced the Whitlam Government to undertake, a mid-term <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is painfully aware of one thing, however, and that is that it is absolutely essential to give its backbenchers and its sympathisers outside this Parliament some glimmer of hope for the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>, whether that <span class="highlight">election</span> is held this year or whether the Government clings to its sinking ship until the end of next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a package which increasingly will become a liability for the Government as the date of the next general <span class="highlight">election</span> becomes closer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  proclaimed during the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign of 1 975 that a Government he led would provide jobs for all who wanted to work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, it is pertinent to question what happened to the tax indexation which the Prime Minister championed so strongly during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When will they next be broken, may well be the question that pensioners will pose when they ponder how they will cast their vote at the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a Budget which spells the Fraser Government’s doom and it heralds the incoming of a Hayden Government at the time of the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, whenever that might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790911_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-In the course of the 1 975 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, promised that if his party was elected to power in this country it would provide what he called government for all the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every Press advertisement that has been put out by the Labor Party during the current State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign is an attack on the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it to you,  Mr President,  that the honourable senator is talking entirely about the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>, which has no relevance to the subject matter of the notice, and in that respect he is abusing the parliamentary Standing Orders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have an <span class="highlight">election</span> on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just heard a fairly incoherent tirade from  Senator Messner,  one that had nothing to do with the subject of this debate but had a great deal to do with the impending <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to concentrate my remarks tonight on the way in which the people of South Australia have perceived the Federal Budget and also, to some extent, on the way in which in the current State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign the Labor Government has abused its responsibilities by trying to pass the buck to the Federal Budget for its deficiencies in government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the 1977 State <span class="highlight">election</span> employment in the private sector in South Australia has fallen by 5,800 people; it is the only mainland State to have had such a fall. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in South Australia we found the Labor Premier, to build a smokescreen for him to try to pass the buck for these disasters in South Australia, calling an immediate <span class="highlight">election</span> the very day after the Federal Budget was brought down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For months he had been banking upon an unpopular Budget, a Budget which he thought he could capitalise on, being brought down to enable him to win by using a smokescreen, by default, by passing the buck, sufficient <span class="highlight">election</span> victory to give the Labor Government another three years in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the very illconceived tactics of the Labor machine in South Australia to force a State <span class="highlight">election</span> on the issue of the Budget is falling flat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that responsible record of the Federal Government and with the very attractive response by the people of South Australia to the Federal Budget, the tactic of the Labor machine to call an <span class="highlight">election</span> in South Australia has fallen flat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has fallen flat doubly because the South Australian Liberal Party, right from the beginning of the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, has concentrated all its thrust entirely on State issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">election</span> on 15th September will give you a real chance to decide the future direction of the Government of this State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last thing that I enjoy doing is entering into the gutter of filth over the current State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for this <span class="highlight">election</span> relates to the raising of taxation by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I put it that more than an <span class="highlight">election</span> is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975, when Labor was defeated in the <span class="highlight">election</span>, I referred in this House to the fact that Rupert Murdoch was the person who decided who was to govern in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the left wing of the Labor Party had committed  Mr Corcoran  to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before in this place,  Mr Corcoran  has been made the front image for the left wing because it knew jolly well that it could not win an <span class="highlight">election</span> with anybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the last South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> employment in the private sector of industry has fallen by 5,800 people, according to the statistics, compared with a rise of 27,000 in New South Wales, 3,000 in Victoria, 2,800 in Western Australia, and nearly 2,000 in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no doubt, again, that this <span class="highlight">election</span> was forced on earlier than usual because the Labor Party in South Australia was running scared of the release of the Auditor-General ‘s report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The headline in the  Advertiser  read: ‘Left Wing “forced” early SA <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had never used to refer to them as ‘the bosses’, but I have become so sick of their propaganda in the last few weeks that I now identify them as bosses who cannot see the morality of assisting their State and of being fair in <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The State Government was confident that industrial democracy would not bc an issue in the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in South Australia, since the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> only 18 months ago, unemployment in the private sector has risen by over 5,800 individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790912_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, is his absence due to illness, or some other personal reason, or to pressure from his union masters to stay home because of the desperate state of the Australian Labor Party in the last days of the State <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these claims of victories and breakthroughs are starkly revealed as being as worthless as a Fraser <span class="highlight">election</span> promise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just a few lines of rhetoric designed to cloud the issues until the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me illustrate what I mean by a cynical approach to industrial relations by referring the Senate to something which happened in October 1977 when this Government, the Fraser Government was seeking an excuse for an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was a prosecution nicely timed to coincide with the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could you explain to us as simply as you can how an <span class="highlight">election</span> a year ahead of time is going to help curb industrial unrest? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I didn’t know that there was going to be an <span class="highlight">election</span> a year ahead of time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Leader of the Government seen the statement by the Premier of New South Wales,  Mr Wran,  that he personally favours a four-year term for governments and that a referendum to alter the term of the New South Wales Parliament could be conducted in conjunction with the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here, the Government’s failure to lower interest rates as it promised- it partially won an <span class="highlight">election</span> on this issue- is well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 December 1977, as an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said he would reduce interest rates by 2 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1977, at the general <span class="highlight">election</span>,  Mr Paul  Baker was the Australian Democrats candidate for the seat of Paterson in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that <span class="highlight">election</span> he polled 6.6 per cent of the vote in Patersonsome 4250 votes- compared with 1.45 per cent for  Mr William  Ignatius O’Donnell, an independent candidate, 57.61 per cent for  Mr Frank  Lionel O ‘Keefe, the National Country Party candidate, and 34.28 per cent for Kerry Donald Scott, the Australian Labor Party candidate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provided on the back of the newspaper was an elaborate how-to-vote chart which promoted  Mr Baker  as the candidate for the seat of Paterson and promoted the Australian Democrats candidates for the Senate <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raise this matter because, as one who has some claim to a fair amount of experience in the operations of political parties during <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns and as one who has served in various capacities in the Liberal Party in New South Wales- as a campaign manager, as a member of the State Executive of the Party and of various other committees concerned with the operations of the Party- I am aware that the general practice of the Liberal Party is that debts incurred by candidates on behalf of the Liberal Party are honoured by the Liberal Party when the candidate or his electorate committee is unable to honour them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the fact that the Australian Democrats as a party have not seen fit to honour a commitment or to assist my constituents to maintain a reasonable position in terms of electoral expenses incurred on their behalf, I use this occasion to make a public appeal to the Australian Democrats to understand that this debt was incurred in terms of the <span class="highlight">election</span> of people to this place and to see that this account is promptly and properly settled with people who are entitled to receive payments for services rendered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is he also aware that, according to respected Tasmanian legal authorities, the <span class="highlight">election</span> of most members of the House of Assembly will probably be declared null and void and, therefore, the constitutional right of the present Government to occupy the treasury benches is in serious doubt? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I just draw attention to the fact that they stand in stark contrast to the attitude displayed by the Prime Minister just prior to the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> when he said that interest rates would fall by 2 per cent over the coming 12 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is interesting that my friend,  Senator Messner  from South Australia, should interject because for the first time ever at the last State <span class="highlight">election</span> in New South Wales, a Labor candidate,  Mr Mair,  was elected as the State Labor member for Albury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to honourable senators that when the next <span class="highlight">election</span> takes place, whenever it might be, they have a look at the figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think it is well known in this place that the two persons I have always made a point of referring to concerning the use of VIP aircraft have been the previous occupant of Government House at Yarralumla and the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  who made great statements during the 1975 general <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that  Mr Whitlam,  the then Prime Minister, was overusing VIP aircraft and made claims about all the things he would do to curtail the use of those aircraft. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We well know that that was another <span class="highlight">election</span> gimmick that he put up to the people and they fell for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Bishop  tabled the document in this place on the third sitting day of the Parliament after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of the Labor Government in December 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it would appear that very special circumstances prevailed on those three days when  Senator Martin, Senator MacGibbon, Mr Katter, Mr Petersen  and  Mr Edwards  travelled round Queensland, no doubt electioneering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those circumstances are to be classed as special circumstances, I expect that during the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign a request by members of the Labor Party to travel round our States with the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  will be classed as special circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791009_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) The desirability of amending the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 to remove the existing ban on the broadcasting or televising of <span class="highlight">election</span> matter after the Wednesday preceding an <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak firstly to the question of amending the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 to remove this absurd ban that is now an anachronism on the broadcasting or televising of <span class="highlight">election</span> matter after midnight on the Wednesday preceding an <span class="highlight">election</span> day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One argument that could be advanced for the proposition for its retention- no doubt the argument was put forward when it was first introduced into legislation- is that one wealthy party could spend a fortune up to midnight on the Friday night before an <span class="highlight">election</span> and swamp all other less affluent parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A party with a great deal of money can and does do that through newspapers at the very last minute on the Friday night or on the Saturday morning of an <span class="highlight">election</span> which then renders a smaller party, or a less wealthy party, totally incapable of responding to that advertisement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I have put in my motion that the Committee ought to consider amending the Act to put a limitation on the amount of expenses that can be spent by any political party or individual in an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third reason for this absurdity is that a political party can still swamp a television station or a radio station on the Wednesday before an <span class="highlight">election</span> with an incredible amount of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also have a ridiculous situation that can and has occurred where there is, say, an obscure by-<span class="highlight">election</span> in a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it is in an area which is way out in the country and where no city issues are affected; it is a by-<span class="highlight">election</span> for a State <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> happened to be taking place at that dme and if perchance a leader of a political party wanted to make his policy speech on a Thursday night and if the State by-<span class="highlight">election</span> was on a Saturday, it could well result in a situation where that policy speech would have to be postponed in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely  Senator McLaren  is not asking me to be naive enough to believe that the trade, unions do not finance the Labor Party in its <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns; The principle is precisely the same although I will concede to  Senator McLaren  that the amount of money given to the Labor Party by trade unions nowhere near compares with the amount of money given to the Liberal and National Country parties by God knows whom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A farce has been carried on in this Parliament ever since I have been a member in relation to the statutory declarations demanded of members of Parliament and senators that on their <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign they have not spent more than a certain amount, have not allowed it to be spent, or are not aware that it has been spent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After a period of 14 days, notwithstanding the fact that  Senator Wriedt,  the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time, had given answer after answer to questions posed on this important Bill, the Loan Bill 1975, the then Opposition decided to defer passage of the Bill until the then Government agreed to go to an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791010_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, is this an indication that the Government is seriously considering holding a general <span class="highlight">election</span> this year? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, when it is near <span class="highlight">election</span> time the Government always wants to do something for the Baltic community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, it is interesting to note the way in which the Government, as my colleague  Senator Sibraa  has mentioned, has been so insensitive to the pleas of the Baltic community, to the needs of which, at <span class="highlight">election</span> time anyway, the Government is notoriously so sensitive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All parties contesting the French <span class="highlight">election</span>, which takes place on 4 and 1 1 March, consider science and technology to be the bread of life and the foundation of progress- at least, in their public utterances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech in November 1977, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  announced that the share of net personal income tax collections allocated to local government would be increased to 2 per cent by 1980-8 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is another example of the Government’s failure to honour not only its <span class="highlight">election</span> policies of 1975 and 1977 but also the commitment which the Minister for Transport,  Mr Nixon,  made in 1977 when he presented the principal legislation to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said he hoped that at the next Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>, the Government’s majority was reduced to one- as that’s all it deserves’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Darwin soya bean meal case demonstrated the need for a time limit on the exercise of this <span class="highlight">election</span>, and this practice is now being adopted in similar cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is basically because of these unacceptable delays that a time limit is being set for the exercising of that <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, with the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> safely out of the way, in the 1978-79 Budget the Government reduced the bounty from $60 to $40. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Speaking during an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign prior to coming into government, quite ironically in Mackay in Queensland,  Mr Sinclair  said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, it may be deterred from doing that by the fact that next year will be an <span class="highlight">election</span> year and it will probably wait, hoping to be re-elected in 1980- although that looks an increasingly forlorn hope- with the intention of passing legislation in 1981 to phase out the bounty from 1 January 1982. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In an <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in the city of Mackay in Queensland- when speaking as a member of the Opposition, of course- he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many other spokesmen at that time used a similar sort of tack in the rush up to the <span class="highlight">election</span> in the hope that they could win government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the deterioration of Labor representation at each Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> since 1972, there is some logic in putting all of the blame on the record of the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it, in the first place, because the Government expected to have an early Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> and it thereby released the statement very secretly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that that will have the support of the whole of the community, including many members of trade union movements who voted for us at the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it may very well be that the whole Bill is designed to provoke and antagonise the trade union movement in order to enable this propaganda offensive to succeed at a forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I exhort Government senators to reject this attempt to set the scene for an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If  Mr Hawke  has any intention of entering this Parliament, perhaps after the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, he will have to learn to behave in a more adult fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Pakistani Government stated that it would not hold an <span class="highlight">election</span> it had promised ‘in the national interest’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can go back, for instance, to the State <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was the <span class="highlight">election</span> in which the sitting member for Kimberley,  Mr Alan  Ridge, very nearly lost his seat to an Aboriginal candidate for the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Ernie  Bridge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new <span class="highlight">election</span> was subsequently held, I think on 19 December 1977, and  Mr Ridge  retained his seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite feasible to suggest that the vote of the black people could tip the balance at the next State <span class="highlight">election</span> which is due early next year, because in a letter presented to the Court of Disputed Returns  Mr Ridge  stated, in part: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would anticipate that the next <span class="highlight">election</span> there could be 3000 to 4000 Aborigines on the roll and under such circumstances the Liberal Party would be doomed to failure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>It is an amendment to the Electoral Act and it will preclude many Aborigines from casting a vote in the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>, on the grounds of illiteracy as much as anything. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that  Mr Davey’s  resignation was the third major step by the Government in its campaign to ensure that the present member for Kimberley, the Minister for Housing,  Mr Alan  Ridge, held the seat at the next State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the next <span class="highlight">election</span> he lost his seat purely because people like this person in the Australian Capital Territory organised against him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the assurance that was given to the egg industry by  Mr Fraser  prior to the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span>; that he would ensure that the law was carried out to the letter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should just mention the electoral situation and draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Commonwealth is engaged with the Western Australian Government in a joint education exercise to try to ensure that Aboriginals in the Kimberley area are able to exercise their franchise without the difficulties that were experienced in the last <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my hope that this education campaign, like the one that preceded the by-<span class="highlight">election</span> after the decision of the court of disputed returns, will reduce the difficulties which led to the voiding of the previous <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-57-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am not aware of any major event taking place tomorrow, unless the Government is going to call an early general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>, my side of politics made an immature judgment and the Japanese Government did exactly the same thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State governments that have just had an <span class="highlight">election</span> are trying to work with the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the three governments that are trying to create a disturbance with the trade unions are those that must soon face an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is obvious that they are doing so for <span class="highlight">election</span> purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In past elections possibly the biggest issue has been that of unemployment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A government seeking re-<span class="highlight">election</span> often desires an enemy, a danger to the people that it must fight and put down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An attempt will be made to place the blame for unemployment on the trade union movement and to deprive members of the public of certain services or goods when <span class="highlight">election</span> time comes around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If my theory about an <span class="highlight">election</span> is a correct one, where will it take place? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That amending Bill provided for the deregistration of unions, the seizing of union funds and property, fines on officers and rank and file trade unionists, suspension from office of union officers, and the debarring of members of trade unions from elevation or <span class="highlight">election</span> to full time or part time office in their union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have heard previous speakers ask whether the Government is contemplating an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said, is it all leading up to an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span> recently demonstrated that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe the results of the 1977 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span> demonstrated this, as did the 1 975 Federal <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a slick, cynical and sick set-up to induce confrontation and industrial turmoil for the purpose of creating another sleazy and dishonest <span class="highlight">election</span> issue, just as the Government did in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is urgent because it has been pointed out by previous speakers that we might have an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had a situation in South Australia prior to the State <span class="highlight">election</span> with the bus employees union where people went along to the depots, agitated for strike action and drove out of the depot with stickers on their cars asking for people to vote for the Tonkin Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, we have already got the warning from  Senator Jessop  that the trade union movement in South Australia will be made the scapegoat for the Tonkin Government’s failure to carry out its <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the forecast here tonight that we will be in this Parliament this time next year debating how the Tonkin Government failed to carry out its outlandish and wide-ranging <span class="highlight">election</span> promises. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Brown  will find it a bit hard to get through because, even though the Labor Party suffered a disastrous defeat at the South Australian <span class="highlight">election</span>, due to a lot of untruthful advertising and the electors being misled, the Tonkin Government does not have the numbers in the South Australian Upper House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason, I think, is that the Prime Minister is going to use it as a prop for his <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He thinks he can win if he has an early <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So an early <span class="highlight">election</span> would suit him in the hope that possibly he could win with a majority of seven or eight seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be looking at this new technological era and tackling it with the unions, finding out where we are going as a nation and how we intend to get there, instead of waiting until the whole lot falls on our heads and we are fighting the next <span class="highlight">election</span> against an army of unemployed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of veterans of allied countries, this Bill honours an <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of the Government made in 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must admit that I was concerned that when the Minister originally announced this problem, which from memory was almost on the eve of the Victorian State <span class="highlight">election</span>, it appeared that Victoria would receive the lion’s share of the $3m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Government that even now twice-yearly indexation is not the indexation which was promised by the conservative parties in their <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign in 1 975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing that, this Government callously broke promises that it had made in the 1 975 and 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaigns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Guilfoyle,  the Minister present tonight, had boasted particularly in the 1 977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign, that the Fraser Government had taken politics out of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the amendment, but in doing so I give notice to the Government that its insensitivity to the unemployed, to those people in the union movement whom I have just described, and to the dependants of those people, will loom large at the time of the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should have obeyed our promise at the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> to maintain the indexation of pensions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Hence the <span class="highlight">election</span> promise of 1975 given by the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  of instant and automatic indexation adjustments of pensions came about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not be the <span class="highlight">election</span> issue that the Government thinks it might be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that at the next <span class="highlight">election</span> this Government will most certainly feel the sting of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government does not do anything by the next <span class="highlight">election</span>, every mother of five children will be told by me and others that the Government has taken away $500 a year from her because it has failed to index family allowances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The emergency relief payments were included in this Budget following an <span class="highlight">election</span> commitment to make available $500,000 to assist voluntary agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note in particular that in this legislation the Government is implementing, as it sees fit, its <span class="highlight">election</span> undertaking in relation to allied ex-servicemen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I can assure you that all of the five persons elected as councillors at the last <span class="highlight">election</span> at Yarrabah were present for the whole of the formal discussion and in this case, as I was actually present, you might accept my version of what happened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A fresh <span class="highlight">election</span> of the whole number of Councillors shall be held at such time as the Manager appoints. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having due regard to all of the circumstances and developments at Yarrabah, it is reasonable that the petition be allowed to proceed, the Council dissolved and a new general <span class="highlight">election</span> be held. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provision does exist for, if necessary, the appointment of an administrator in lieu of the Council should it be deemed desirable that a fairly lengthy interim period be allowed to proceed between dissolution of the Council and a new <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the new <span class="highlight">election</span> went ahead and, on that first occasion, there were real problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purpose of assessing the petition, it is worthy of note that the largest number of Yarrabah residents who have taken advantage of their right to vote at Council Elections in recent years was three hundred and forty (340) at the General <span class="highlight">Election</span> on 16th January 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately prior to the forced <span class="highlight">election</span> in December of that year the present Prime Minister,  Mr Fraser,  was already threatening to abolish the PJT on the very grounds that I mentioned earlier- that insufficient profitability levels were being maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government made an undertaking during the last <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign that it would increase local government’s share of personal income tax collections to 2 per cent in the next Budget. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the second reading speech delivered by the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  it was pointed out that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in his <span class="highlight">election</span> policy speech in November 1977 referred to the fact that the share of net personal income tax collections allocated to local government would be increased to 2 per cent by 1 980-8 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the news has come at an opportune time as preliminary plans are being made; and councils and municipalities will now be able to plan on a secure basis and follow through the program which the present Government has initiated and carried through since its <span class="highlight">election</span> to office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes we probably take it for granted that Commonwealth funds of some size go to local authorities, but this really started only after the <span class="highlight">election</span> of 1972, which, as we all know, was towards the end of the year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, of course, next year is <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the letter to the Tasmanian Premier was made public just prior to the last Tasmanian State <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was scheduled to come into effect on 1 July 1977 and because he had an <span class="highlight">election</span> in mind for 1977 he was not game to force the issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the 1977 <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign he refused, as did  Senator Carrick,  to accept the challenge which I, and probably others, issued on this point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let the Australian people realise- the State Premiers already do- the significance and implications if this man is returned after the next <span class="highlight">election</span> and allowed to continue with his policy of Fraser federalism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We know of all the problems it has had from time to time, but whatever  Mrs Gandhi  might have done at least when she was removed from office she was removed by an <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make it absolutely plain that there are 400,000 people in the Public Service who would have liked to have known, now that party preselections are going up, whether there is any possibility of a reasonable deal being given to them whether they should be allowed as other Australians are to nominate in a reasonable way as candidates for <span class="highlight">election</span> to this place or the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another of the reasons why there has been an attempt to cram legislation through is that tentative arrangements were made for an <span class="highlight">election</span> to be held on 8 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to disagree,  Mr President,  but one of the reasons for cramming this legislation through is the fear that there might be a snap <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is relevant-I am not disagreeing- because there has been a great panic on that side of the chamber ever since the beginning of the Budget session because of the fear that the master of the Party, the master of the Parliament, would call a snap <span class="highlight">election</span> without telling them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do honourable senators opposite know that in recent weeks their Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has had lengthy discussions with senior members of the Commonwealth Electoral Office in a search for all the options with regard to which date would be the most suitable to hold an <span class="highlight">election</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, next year is an <span class="highlight">election</span> year and the Prime Minister might say: ‘I will put them off until after the <span class="highlight">election</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Who would have thought that Article 1 of the United States Constitution, which makes the statement that it is necessary to have a well regulated militia should be used as the basis for striking down all gun control legislation in the United States or indeed that the provisions of Article 1 which relate to free speech should be used in the case of Buckley v. Valeo as the basis for saying that there can be no limit on <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign expenditure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Labor does not gain office next <span class="highlight">election</span>, then by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office, we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791114_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Knowing all this the Liberal Party in Western Australia, with the full support of  Sir Charles  Court and some other prominent Western Australian Liberals, especially State politicians, and in spite of the spirited opposition of  Senator Durack  and  Senator Withers,  has endorsed this man, Crichton-Browne, as a member of its Senate team for the next <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as State <span class="highlight">election</span> laws are concerned these are matters for State Governments and Parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-17">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Walsh has mentioned briefly the promise given by  Mr Lynch  prior to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> at a dinner given by the wine and grape growers in the Barossa Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the <span class="highlight">election</span> campaign great play was made about that promise and the Labor Party was severely criticised for repealing that section of the Income Tax Assessment Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators look back over the last 10 years as I have done, at a period which covers both Labor and nonLabor governments- with the exception of last year when the Government introduced this practice of lifting the Senate very early, well before the end of November- they will see that in all of the other years, excepting years when elections were held, the Senate sat until at least 10 December. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, 1977 was an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Some people have suggested that the Government has ignored the problems of the unemployed; that it has taken the cold political judgment that the unemployed are not the people who will vote for it in next year’s <span class="highlight">election</span> anyway and that the people who will vote for it in next year’s <span class="highlight">election</span> anyway are a selfish group of our society who have work and are prosperous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sad though as it may seem to be, the appearances of things are often much more important in deciding public issues or even elections than the actual facts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was called an <span class="highlight">election</span> Budget but it backfired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it had been an <span class="highlight">election</span> Budget it would have assisted the Australian Labor Party and not Fraser. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their leader has assumed a dictatorial position, with a threat to Government members that any of them who do not follow the lead will have their candidature opposed at the next general <span class="highlight">election</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said at the time, and it has not been denied since, that it was just an <span class="highlight">election</span> jaunt around Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But leading up to the 1975 <span class="highlight">election</span> the incumbent of the Prime Minister’s office continually criticised  Mr Whitlam  in regard to travel and that is why I raise the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Walsh  said in his Press statement, the present GovernorGeneral ought to be following the action of the previous Governor-General and installing  Mr Hayden  in government as a caretaker Prime Minister until there can be an <span class="highlight">election</span> and this Government answers to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791120_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will all recall that prior to the last general <span class="highlight">election</span> the present Prime Minister (  Mr Malcolm  Fraser) gave an assurance that Australia would not be put into hock and that we would not become dependent on overseas capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am further concerned that the reason lying behind that decision was not any concern that there would be any actual threat to the security of Australia as a result of the visit of that Organisation but rather a blatant political one, that the visit of that Organisation to an event sponsored by the Government in an <span class="highlight">election</span> year would be unpopular with some significant sections of the Australian community and would, as a result, conceivably do some political damage to the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The interesting development was at the Liberal Party Conference in Melbourne last week, when the Victorian State Minister for Agriculture,  Mr Smith,  announced that the decision by the Victorian Government to guarantee $4.5m to that organisation was made on a political basis- the political basis being that because there was a forthcoming <span class="highlight">election</span>, it was deemed wise for the Victorian State Government to give that guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Smith made the announcement that the decision to back the co-operative by guaranteeing the sum of $4.5m was a political one because an <span class="highlight">election</span> was on the way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the $9m loan was agreed to because it was an <span class="highlight">election</span> year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that the Liberal Government in Victoria won the <span class="highlight">election</span> by an overall majority of only one seat. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition and the National Party moved a censure motion on  Mr Smith  over his statement that the CF and G was given loan guarantees because an <span class="highlight">election</span> was pending. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is further regrettable- that is the point I was making- that  Mr Smith  has publicly stated that the Victorian Government entered into the agreement so hurriedly because of a pending Victorian <span class="highlight">election</span> and the State Government had to use the matter as an <span class="highlight">election</span> ploy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know the attitude of parliamentarians to anyone who interferes with their <span class="highlight">election</span> signs so I ask the Minister to ask her colleague the Minister for Health what his attitude is towards that reference and whether he is aware that, if a statement is not made on it, it could be interpreted as being the policy of the Department and those people whose property is being attacked may be forced into the position of having to protect their property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
