    <p>Will) the proposed Nuclear Power Station at Murray’s Beach, in the Jervis Bay region of New South Wales, require a causeway to he built across to Bowen Island; if so, what action will the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission take to stop the influx of rats tothe island which has a thriving penguin rookery where the penguins’ eggs would be a prime target for rate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is aware of the penguin rookery on Bowen Island and, as has been stated before, is anxious to preserve as far as possible the natural state of the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I fear similar opposition when 1 direct my personal criticism against the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I think it would be much better if we had other scientific bodies to examine the standards which the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission claims to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Linus Pauling was scoffed at when he first made some suggestions about pollution but in America now even some of the State authorities are not accepting everything said by <span class="highlight">atomic</span> scientists as being gospel which must not be questioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to the information I have, a number of study groups are undertaking environmental tests of the area but in the final analysis all the data is going back to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for final evaluation and I think that is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage we do not say that any <span class="highlight">atomic</span> wastage is affecting oysters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The monitoring carried out in that area is under the control of a troika consisting of the State Department of Health, the New South Wales Maritime Services Board and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But then we discovered that the only people with the sophisticated instruments necessary are those employed by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Are we to assume that despite all the environmental pollution feasibility studies, in effect, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission alone will determine standards and that no Cabinet curbs will be applied to some of the Bonapartist tendencies of the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I was referring to the Bonapartist tendencies of the present Chairman of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700922_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators 1 present an interim report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the year ended 30th June 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>586, there is a network of 26 stations throughout Australia and New Guinea administered by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee conducts two complementary monitoring programmes for radioactive fallout in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Eighteenth Annual Report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was tabled today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After Cabinet consideration of the report of the feasibility study, and further discussions with the New South Wales Government, the Prime Minister announced in October 1969 that the Commonwealth Government would ‘take Australia into the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age by beginning the construction of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> plant at Jervis Bay to generate electricity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said: ‘We believe that Australia will make increasing use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power in the years ahead, and that the time for this nation to enter the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age has now arrived.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No real protests have been lodged about the French <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 15th May an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> test was carried out in the Pacific by France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701015_senate_27_s46/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anybody who has driven along the Melbourne to Geelong road when one of the 707 aircraft has flown low overhead will know that it is like being hit by an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When that project was abandoned the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Government moved quickly into the setting up of a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay in the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since then a tremendous number of queries have been raised by a very large and powerful body of skilled people outside of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Baxter, who is in charge of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has said that probably in the next 30 years - before the turn of the century - $5,000m will be spent on the development of nuclear power in Australia, In fairness to him I should make it clear that this amount will be spent not only by the Commonwealth but also by industry in Australia on the development of nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission have been very good and have helped us by discussing the subject with us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a bomb hit the station it would have the same effect as exploding a very large <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we were at war and if a bomb hit it, it would have the same effect as exploding a large <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be the equivalent of the force of a giant <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia is moving not only into the era of the use of nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes but also into the era of a very real danger of a hit by a bomb, which would have the effect of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb exploding there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is already an exchange of knowledge between the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy commissions of America, Canada and other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has before it tenders from several parts of the world for the building of this station, ft has not yet let the tenders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is in touch throughout the world with work proceeding on fast breeder reactors and thermal reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has made a point for a number of years of sending officers overseas to study ali these matters and the relevant legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pay full tribute to officers of the Department of the Interior for their vigilance in being able to inform the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution of the serious pollution of the Finniss River by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anyone who has read the report of that Committee knows of the amazing answer from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission that the Finniss River ran out into nowhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite frankly, I do not believe the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would be very interested to see the plans of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in respect of locations of future nuclear reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701104_senate_27_s46/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us examine the matter for the purpose of seeing what validity we should give to this book by Catherine R. Dalton who submits a theory that, with the investigation of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> expansion after the Second World War, a tripartite agreement was entered into at Quebec between Canada, Great Britain and the United States for the exchange of information on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, chemical and biological warfare, and rocketry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the agreement for the exchange of <span class="highlight">atomic</span>, chemical and biological warfare and rocket information? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710315_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is history now that the Department of the Interior has conducted field surveys to see what rehabilitation has been carried out by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-89-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The uranium and copper mining and treatment operations at Rum Jungle have been under the control of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The results of these tests have been made available to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Department decided to leave this River with15 miles of its banks devastated; if not, what compensation towards this River’s rehabilitation will be forthcoming from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson, on behalf of the then Prime Minister supplied the necessary information as to the salaries and allowances of various statutory officers, including the chairmen of the Australian Apple and Pear Board, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Australian Canned Fruits Board, the Australian Canned Fruits Sales Promotion Committee, the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority, the Australian Capital Territory Totalisator Agency <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar questions were asked about the  Chairman  and members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710420_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that they will query the sort of yardstick that is used when they study the war trials of the Nazi war criminals and consider that the very nations which set up those courts were at that time discussing the possibilities of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> war and searching for devices which could lead to massacre on a far grander scale than was ever contrived by Hitler and his gang of wicked men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I present a report produced by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee entitled ‘Fallout Over Australia From Nuclear Weapons Tested By France In Polynesia From May To August 1970’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the Agreement for the exchange of <span class="highlight">atomic</span>, chemical and biological warfare and rocket information? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In brief, this programme covers in principle the whole of military, research and development excluding the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> field, and is an agreement to exchange information and to co-operate in research and development activities in a way which is designed to avoid unnecessary and undesirable duplication of work, and to co-operate in joint activities where this produces advantages to the co-operators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although we have failed in the case of  Dr Bogie  and  Mrs Chandler,  and also in the case of  Mr Dalton,  an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> scientist, I believe that my claim can be proved clearly when one considers the case of an unidentified body that was found on the Somerton beach in South Australia on 1st December 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710507_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the very great advancement in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power generation, which advancement is continuing and accelerating, to a stage at which it is predicted that in most advanced countries future power installations will be solely <span class="highlight">atomic</span>, would not the authorities in Tasmania be advised to pause before committal to further large scale hydro-electric generation projects, which some people claim are destructive of tourist assets in Tasmania, an aspect in which the Minister is particularly interested? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have every confidence that not only is conservation being well attended to in this development but also the scientific aspect of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy overtaking hydro-electric energy is being well understood by the HydroElectric Commission in Tasmania. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710511_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediate^ly it was discovered that there was not a secret clause that gave Immunity to breaches of the law by foreign agents we had introduced into this country the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act which applies to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency and other international agencies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have reached the position where regulations have extended the Act to cover employees of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst those employed by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency have been in Australia for many years it has been only as a result of the publication of questions and answers that we found that no immunity had been given to those working for foreign powers within Australia if they breach our laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But until such a time as the regulation applies in Australia if there is a breach of Australian law by any foreign agent working for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710518_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Are there persons from foreign countries in Australia by arrangement with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am informed that the only persons from foreign countries at present in Australia by arrangement with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency are 2 Indonesians who hold fellowships under the United Nations Development Programme, for which the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency made the necessary arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Two safeguards inspectors of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency visited Australia from 15th to 23rd April 1971 to inspect safeguarded material supplied by the United Stales to Australia under the agreement for co-operation concerning the civil uses of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy in force between Australia and the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Department of National Development designed and implemented a more effective code to combat water pollution of rivers adjacent to mining operations, in view of the neglect shown by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in polluting the East Finniss River; if so, how can the Minister justify the gross water pollution that has been inflicted on the Dampier Archipelago by the operations of the Hamersley Iron group mining operations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-81-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An aggressor could not help itself in the taking over of us by closing down the Pine Gap establishment or obliterating an Omega station, but it could take us over if the hearts and minds of the people were crushed as a result of the dropping of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs over Sydney, “Brisbane, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth and Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As you would know,  Mr Temporary Chairman,  from your activities when you were  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> ^Energy Commission’s claims about safeguards have not always proved correct. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In North America, as I think the Minister would be aware, there is a tendency to have other people with equal technical know-how monitoring these readings and not to leave it to the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> research people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711208_senate_27_s50/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the former  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission,  Sir Phillip  Baxter, been retained by the government in any consultative or advisory capacity subsequent to his retirement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-131-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall that at one time I placed a notice of motion on the notice paper to disallow a regulation which, under some agreement between Australia, the United States of America and Great Britain, gave immunity to those associated with an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a series of questions and negotiations with the Minister I obtained the knowledge that the immunity did not apply to those to whom I thought it applied but to persons associated with conferences which might be held in Australia under an international agreement dealing with the peaceful use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representatives intending to attend that seminar which was held under the auspices of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and arranged by the United Nations organisation attracted, broadly speaking, the same measure of diplomatic immunity as an ambassador. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think we satisfied him that it was appropriate that visitors coming here to attend a seminar relating to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy at the instance of the United Nations organisation should have that diplomatic immunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my recollection that those who entered Australia under the regulation which related to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission conference were provided with immunities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720822_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some of his decisions at home and abroad, particularly in times of war, will be forever disputed, including his decision to use <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons against Japan during the Second World War. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730227_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As he has indicated that the French Government was good enough to give him television time to explain the attitude of Australia to French nuclear testing, will the Attorney-General direct  Dr Stephen  Fitzgerald, the Australian Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, immediately to request that Government to give him radio time in China to express Australia’s deep opposition to the continued testing by China of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> devices? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730501_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Obviously in Australia there are various existing authorities, such as the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, the Joint Coal Board, and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, which would have representation on such an authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a matter to which I have referred before and to which I shall refer again and again in the Gaitskell tradition, namely, the bungling that went on not so long long ago during the tenure of office of an inept Minister for the Interior when there was a failure to discipline the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the way in which it polluted the Finniss River with industrial waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite my cry for justifiable ministerial or departmental vengeance nobody ever disciplined the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for its scandalous behaviour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will know it was only after incessant probing that we were able to get from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission the sorry story of its deliberate - I use that word in the fullest sense - pollution of the river. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To show honourable senators how bipartisan I am, I have indicted on the one instance the Lake George private enterprise mining complex and in the other a government organisation, namely, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that we will see no more of the terrible happenings that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has condoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730508_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>if not more vital than, the protection of Australian citizens from <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fallout or anything else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730509_senate_28_s56/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It concerns the subject of man-made nuclear fallout and relates to the tabled reports of the National Radiation Advisory Committee, the Academy of Science and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Testing Committee and specifically to certain information which I have sought to obtain, very unsuccessfully, from the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government aware of the facts contained in the report of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee which was tabled by  Senator Murphy  last week and which refers to fallout over Australia from nuclear weapons tested by the French in Polynesia during June and July 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730510_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator McManus  has put forward part of the case that obviously will be presented against us, that is, that Britain and Australia collaborated in the conducting of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests many years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we know a lot more about pollution today, particularly <span class="highlight">atomic</span> pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the early days of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> research people went to gaol because they believed that the communist countries of the world should be given the same information as was developed in the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730516_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that  Sir Philip  Baxter was  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission For 15 years from 1957 to 1972? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the representative in this chamber of the Minister for Health, I can say to the honourable senator that I understand that  Sir Philip  Baxter was  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for some 15 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government review the stupidity of its present action at the International Court of Justice if it is a fact that French <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> tests are no more harmful than personal X-rays. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730517_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Test Safety Committee with Professor  Sir Ernest  Titterton and the National Radiation Advisory Committee with  Sir Philip  Baxter have been scrapped recently by the Whitlam Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730522_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should be developing very quickly our ability to produce <span class="highlight">atomic</span> or nuclear energy, and certainly in this regard we should be looking to those far : outlying areas of Australia where it will be enormously expensive to take fuel energy by means of a national grid pipeline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, there was the Snowy Mountains scheme for hydro electricity, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy and we had the various resources of the Department of National Development in which information which was required was collated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, proposals, have been advanced for the creation of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy power station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730523_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Professor Messel, now special adviser to the Attorney-General, was reported in the ‘Daily Telegraph’ of 16 October 1953 as saying of the then <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions at Woomera: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I mentioned the other day in this place - and  Senator Carrick  adverted to this today - that what we knew then about pollution, and particularly <span class="highlight">atomic</span> pollution, is nothing when compared With what we know today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is, as I freely admitted the other day, that this is the sort of argument which will be used against us because we did acquiesce in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions some 20 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister assisting the Prime Minister aware that both France and China opposed a motion which was moved at the World Health Organisation by Australia and which condemned <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests in the atmosphere? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes in our policy in no way affect the restrictions placed by Australia on the export of arms, warlike stores and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730524_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Government take into consideration the fact that Noumea is a colony and that its people have no control over the decision in regard to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions but, on the contrary, Noumea is one of the Pacific Islands for which Australia says it is intervening at The Hague? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730531_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Mr Chou  En-lai exhibited considerable resentment and said that China would continue to conduct <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests in the same way as previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730605_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as shown by reference to the various reports of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Radiation, including that of 1972, for many countries there are no fall-out data at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730608_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Attorney-General more than any other man withheld from this Parliament, until we dragged them out of him, fact after valuable fact on nuclear and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple fact is that if this Government were, like the Opposition, sincere in believing that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing is damaging to humanity wherever it occurs, it would realise quite clearly that tens of millions - nay, hundreds of millions - of Chinese near Lop Nor in the Sinkiang Province and the Chinese and Russians around them are in numbers far more greatly subjected to danger to their lives than those said to be affected by the Mururoa Atoll tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730822_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have har1 thunderings about the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests in the Pacific. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Chou En-lai declared that China sympathised with and supported the actions of France in exploding <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730823_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such attempts become irrelevant anyway when it is acceptable to destroy whole cities, with ordinary people in them, as was done in Japan by the use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs and as was done at other times. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For anybody to cast aspersions on the dropping of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb on Hiroshima in response to this proposal, to me is unworthy of the country of the cause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were at the stage where we condemned <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons tests right around the world, underground or in the atmosphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What they are doing now in the Pacific is working on an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fusion trigger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say that when  Mr Whitlam  gave that answer he exploded completely any pretence that he and his Government were actuated by humanitarian motives in opposing <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is all right for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fallout to be scattered over Chinese, North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese, Siberians or Japanese. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objection of this Government is to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fallout being scattered over or near Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the proper attitude for the Labor Government to adopt would be to say that it will break off its present relations, particularly from a trade point of view, with China until China promises to cease <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Bad as some of these border squabbles are, the day that a Middle East power- be it Israel on one hand, or Syria or Algeria on the other- is let loose with <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons, I do not know what will happen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have checked them also from the publications of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a surface <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion, heavy activated debris and fragments are tom from the soil and incorporated in the fireball by fusion or vaporisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He went on to say: ‘But the Chinese are more justified in going <span class="highlight">atomic</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He then started to defend the Chinese for going <span class="highlight">atomic</span>, for building bombs and exploding bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much has it been unwilling to accept the advice of its scientists on the National Radiation Advisory Committee and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee that in order to remove the necessity of having to listen to their advice it has abolished those 2 bodies and is reforming them, leaving off those scientists who do not give it information of a politically satisfactory nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he does not tell us, for example, is the experience of those workmen who have been working at the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power stations in England and who have been exposed to massive amounts of fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With every breath in my body what I am trying to say is that we should stop <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I want to plead is that the Government should now present to this Parliament a White Paper setting out in true perspective the whole basic background of the ordinary natural fallout and of peoples exposure to it; the elective fallouts from altitude or travel, luminous watches and X- rays; the elective fallouts if we are to have civil <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power stations; the elective fallouts if we are to bring in civil <span class="highlight">atomic</span> ships- and this will be real in the future because of the energy crisisand also the fallouts from atom testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730920_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We with our enormous resources are compared with countries surrounded by major military nations that have recourse to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons, as many nations in Europe have today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pursuant to section 3 1 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1966, I present the twenty-first annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the year ended 30 June 1973 together with financial statements and the Auditor-General ‘s report on those statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other day we aligned ourselves with China when, although China had exploded and indicated that it would continue to explode <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs, we announced that we had made a treaty with China under which China, in our eyes, would be the most favoured nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has this Government thought that by the time we may have got around to this- not having done any homework at all and not having, I suspect, even consulted the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in Australia and certainly having no blueprint- and that by the time we had got another of these expensive situations like the natural gas pipeline but which will be twelve times as dear, the world supply probably will be in glut? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case the need for producing <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy by fission will have passed and the fusion method will have been introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose, of course, is to abolish the full time position of executive member of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and to substitute the part-time position of member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not wish to delay the business of the Senate nor to make a major debate on this matter but as we are referring to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission I wish to make some brief remarks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But above all, because I am talking about the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission I pose this question and we need to have some very accurate answers in the months and years ahead if we are to make the right judgments: Will we have to use our uranium either sparingly because we have to conserve it or freely because we do not have to conserve it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from commending the Bill I call upon the Government in terms of the energy crisis to use to the full the magnificent resources of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may not be fashionable to talk about France in this era of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing, but at least it can be said that no matter what type of government has been in power in Francewhether it be a popular front government, the De Gaulle Government or any other political combination- little areas like Martinique and Noumea have had representatives in the Chamber of Deputies in Paris. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On one memorable occasion when that Committee was taking evidence in Darwin from representatives of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission- a body for which I do not have a lot of timeevidence was given that was very close to perjury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I accepted that as a compliment that I had pinpointed the inadequacies of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731114_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee further reports that it was unable to complete its examination of the Particulars of Certain Proposed Expenditure in respect of the Year ending on 30 June 1974 for the Department of Minerals and Energy, Division 890, Subdivision 1.- Plant and Equipment- Item 04 (purchase of pipes and associated equipment for the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline) $54,000,000; Sub-division 2-(for expenditure under the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act) $13,100,000; Sub-division 3- (for expenditure under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act) $1,388,000; 4-(for expenditure under the Pipeline Authority Act) $107,000,000; and Division 891,-Other Services Item 01. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They relate to such important matters as the appropriations for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, the Pipeline Authority and the Moomba to Sydney pipeline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731115_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-43-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That at the moment the Government is providing fifty times larger funds for research into <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy than for research into solar energy; that, on the other hand, latest scientific research indicates that energy production from the atom has become obsolete and undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest that the ratio of Government funding be reversed- away from <span class="highlight">atomic</span> in favour of solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740305_SENATE_28_S59/#subdebate-9-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Russians already have, as we all know, <span class="highlight">atomic</span> submarines in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740306_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had the spectacle of certain trade unions having an argument with France over <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740312_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where is the program spelt out by the Minister for Minerals and Energy to co-ordinate and urge work by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I understand the position correctly, the Minister has virtually ignored the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say this to excuse in any way the atmospheric use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs to which I am opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What have we heard about uranium, apart from the abysmal silence of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  with regard to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has no policy on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy development or experimentation to determine cost benefits of uranium enrichment or the relative merits of nuclear reactors of the conventional type and breeder reactors, or on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy in the fusion area of the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740402_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have survived world wars over the generations but because of the advance of technology and the splitting of the atom- things have never been the same in the fields of defence and aggression since the day they successfully split the atom- we will not survive another world war involving the use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all right to say that we can keep out of these things but when super-powers are confronting each other, fighting and using <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons, we with the small nations of the world will become mere pawns in the game and we will not be masters of our own destiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first things that are always looked at in any arms limitation are <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing we do in looking at the Indian Ocean is to say that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons should be excluded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not want the great powers to come in with <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can sum up what he said by saying: ‘<span class="highlight">Atomic</span> weapons are terrible things, therefore we do not need any defence or foreign policy’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obvious thing which this Government overlooks is that because of the balance of terror it is unlikely in the near future that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons will be used at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740403_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we started our inquiry we found that pollution was rampant in the Finniss River as a result of the activities of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Davidson,  the late  Senator Ridley  and I went to the Northern Territory we were able to expose river pollution which was caused by Baxter and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that with the complexities of government these senators would be able to move around the Northern Territory and expose more of this shocking criminal folly that was committed by Baxter and the minions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently we have seen the invoking of a dormant provision in the 20-year- old <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I lay on the table the text of the agreement between Australia and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency on the application of safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The top 25 oil corporations control 84 per cent of oil, 72 per cen t of gas, 50 per cent of coal, 80 per cent of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> or nuclear power and 60 per cent of electric power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The top 25 oil companies in the United States now control 84 per cent of all oil, 72 per cent of all gas, 54 per cent of all coal and 80 per cent of all <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power, together with 60 per cent of all electric power in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution visited the Northern Territory it found out after persistent investigation that even a Government authority- I say this advisedly- in the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission had polluted the Finniss River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy (Prescribed Substances) Regulations as contained in Statutory Rules 1974 No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>39, and made under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1 953- 1 973 be disallowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The power under which the Minister seeks to operate under these Statutory Rules is contained in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The object of the Act and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of uranium as to its use in the production of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those powers are quite adequate and they relate specifically to uranium in the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission had been set up to supervise generally the prospecting for and mining of uranium, and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that respect, it was relying on the general ownership power contained in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to which I have referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the attention of the Senate- perhaps  Senator Durack  has already done so- to the heading ‘ Reasons for <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy (Prescribed Substances) Regulations’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would hope the industry could collectively develop policies which it could suggest to the Opposition and to the Government and hopefully develop an economic enterprise which will preserve Australia’s reserves through into the day when we must inevitably rely heavily on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the situation we find today when many companies, particularly in the uranium area, are unable to operate from a research and developmental point of view and unable to continue drilling in this extremely important exploit area, purely because they have no licence through regulations which are part of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and which are related to security situations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the exploration that is required, because of the investigations in the field of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, because of the technical developments and because of the development of breeder reactors, it is fairly well and fairly certainly recognised that the market for uranium will exist for a relatively short period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These regulations are based on the wartime powers of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the motion for the disallowance of the regulations under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That consideration of General Business be postponed until after the conclusion of the debate on the motion for disallowance of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy (Prescribed Substances) Regulations or at 4 p.m., whichever is the earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not make the accusation that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission somehow created the serious radioactive waste pollution in the Finniss River, but there was some secondary waste pollution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that he would be conversant with the references to enrichment which are contained in the report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is keeping fully abreast of developments in this area overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To this end holders of approved contracts for the export of uranium from deposits in the Northern Territory were, earlier this year, offered access to designated deposits owned by the Commonwealth pursuant to section 35 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1953 the then Menzies Government introduced a Bill for an Act for the stated purpose of bringing together in one piece of legislation all matters associated with the provision of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In doing so that Government, through its responsible Minister in each chamber, expressed the belief that it had produced a fair and powerful piece of legislative machinery to shape the future of Australia in this important field of uranium and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That legislation now stands on the statute book as the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Among other things Part III of the Act lays down provisions for the control of substances of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy significance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In essence this part of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act reenacted the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy (Control of Materials) Act 1946 which was amended by the Menzies Government in 1952. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Against that background it is incorrect to claim that the making of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Regulations- they are the regulations we are debating- is in any way improper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree with his comments about the lack of leadership that has been shown by the Opposition in this area of mineral resources, <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy and uranium deposits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s action is likely to bring severe hardship and possible ruin to sections of a basic primary industry and I feel the situation I have outlined makes a mockery not only of their earlier promises but shows in their true light the sham and hypocrisy of prominent Ministers who protest loudly about <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions whilst they continue to encourage and assist imports from countries concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Progress in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy engineering is such that we will not be ready in 10 years to take over with <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, but if we went solar, particularly in the house hold needs area, we would have some chance of taking up to 25 per cent of our fossil fuel requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Thomas; That is interest on moneys borrowed by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission on overdraft in order to pay for the first instalment on the shares which the Commission has purchased in Mary Kathleen Uranium pursuant to an underwriting agreement between the Commission and the Mary Kathleen company. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750513_senate_29_s64/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The information requested by the honourable senator is given in a Review of Thirty Years Study of Hiroshima and Nagasaki <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Bomb Survivors published in September 1975 as a Supplement to the Journal of Radiation Research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This publication reviews the results of the studies made by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Bomb Casualty Commission (a joint enterprise of the Japanese and United States Governments), on the Japanese populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who incurred radiation exposure consequent to the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions over those cities in August 1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Bomb Casualty Commission was dissolved in April 1975 to be replaced by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation which also operates as a joint enterprise of the Japanese and United States Governments to continue the surveillance of the Japanese <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb survivors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to developmental abnormalities in children born of mothers who were pregnant and in the two Japanese cities at the time of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions, the qualitative findings of studies on the children are that, compared with children not exposed to ionising radiation in utero, there was an increased incidence of reduction of height, weight and head and chest circumference measurements which persisted to maturity and an increased incidence of mental retardation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 13 per cent of a group of children irradiated in utero as a result of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions showed a mean reduction of head circumference at maturity of about 1 centimetre compared with an incidence of about 4 per cent of a like deformity in a control group of Japanese children in utero at the time of the explosions but not exposed to radiation doses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand about 3 per cent of a group of children irradiated in utero as a’ result of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions showed evidence of some mental retardation compared with an incidence of about 1 per cent in the control group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (3) As already indicated in answer to part 1 of the question, in some of the children born of mothers who were pregnant at the time of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions, effects of a developmental character occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the basis of the studies carried out to-date there is no evidence of any effects on the genetic structure of the Japanese population of Hiroshima and Nagasaki exposed to the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From data published by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency it has been estimated that at the most, nine lung cancer deaths per year may be attributed to the release of radon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From available scientific data produced by recognised authorities like the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, and the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the concentration of radon in the atmosphere will be increased by uranium production, by about one ten-thousandth of the concentration of radon naturally occurring in the atmosphere, due to its natural release from the earth ‘s surface. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To the contrary a number of reports have been produced in recent years, including the 1972 Report to the UN General Assembly on the ‘Effects of <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Radiation’; the 1976 OECD Nuclear Energy Agency Report on ‘Estimated Population Exposure from Nuclear Power Production and Other Radiation Sources’; the 1973 Report of the United States Environmental Protection Agency on ‘Environmental Analysis of the Uranium Fuel Cycle’; and the United Kingdom Royal Commission on ‘Environmental Pollution on Nuclear Power and the Environment’; all of which give objective and comprehensive assessments of the environmental and health impact of the nuclear power industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1) In the light of the recent Fox Inquiry finding that ‘if one accepts even the more conservative estimates of the development of peaceful nuclear energy programs in a large number of countries during the rest of this century, the costs of the application of safeguards by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency might increase to an extent where there would be opposition by member states to paying such a substantial bill’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As regards other member states of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, avoidance of the costs of safeguards would involve withdrawal from the IAEA which involves more than just safeguards aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-30-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the conclusion of the recent Salzburg Conference, the most important international conference held in recent years on all aspects of nuclear power, the Director General of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency referred to the agreement of the meeting that nuclear power was a necessary and irreplaceable source of the future energy supply to mankind for both the short and the longer term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major systems of international safeguards are administered by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These cover: The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; the application of effective International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware that work has recently been underway within the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency on a new system of equality stringent safeguards to cover the entire nuclear industry in non-nuclear weapon states which are not parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will therefore export only to nuclear weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the uranium we supply be covered by International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the Government wishes to ensure that if a decision is taken to permit new uranium export, the uranium will be covered by International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards from the time it leaves Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it will be the Government’s policy that any future sales arrangements for exports of Australian uranium should be such that the uranium will be in a form which attracts full International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from uranium importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already made clear that Australia would not be prepared to export uranium to such countries in the absence of International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards applied under the NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Government feels it is reasonable to ask importing countries who will already accept International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards of comprehensive scope under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to accept that, at the first fallback level also, international safeguards should apply to all nuclear material, not just that portion supplied by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we believe the agreements should specify compliance with standards of physical security based, at a minimum, on International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency recommendations as presently defined and as updated from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will also continue to attach major importance to the effective application of safeguards by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries- both uranium importers and major nuclear exporters- and relevant international organisations including the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-68-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Court is understood to have ruled that while the plans for the plant conform to the laws governing reactor safety, the safeguards against the possible bursting of the pressure vessel did not reflect the latest available technology as required by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-52-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently I was in the United States and there I learnt from reading a publication called the  National Enquirer,  which was published in March this year, that since 1969 there had been 170 threats and acts of violence against <span class="highlight">atomic</span> plants, causing millions of dollars of damage in the United States, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the United Kingdom, where police do not carry guns, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Authority has its own special constabulary to guard installations and the movement of specified nuclear materials such as plutonium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency in its monthly bulletin  A tom,  to which I have already alluded, gives a summary of a report produced by the European regional office of the World Health Organisation on ‘Health Implications of Nuclear Power production’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to a memorandum of understanding between the co-venturers, dated 28 October 1975, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission (AAEC) will provide 7214 per cent of the capital required for the project and Peko and Electrolytic Zinc 133/4 per cent each. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today Russia, which is not a signatory to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty but which is a member of the international <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy agency, is working like fury with other countries to see what can be done to establish international banks to handle plutonium wastes which come as a result of fast breeders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These dangers are far greater in a plutonium era than in normal <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste eras. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a coastal state wishes to build an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb all it has to do is use uranium in sea water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the country which wishes to build an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb has shale rocks it has any quantity of uranium at a price. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; the application of effective International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ford Foundation in America, a respected research establishment there, has said that crude <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs can be manufactured in clandestine laboratories with relatively modest amounts of know-how. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  Canberra Times  of 18 May 1977 reported a British newspaper which said that it had assembled all the parts of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb except for the plutonium explosive, to demonstrate that terrorists could do the same. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that there are countries agitating to use <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs- small countries that want to improve their status, small countries that want to be big countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government wishes to ensure that if a decision was taken to permit new uranium  export,  the uranium would be covered by International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards from the time it left Australia ‘s ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable senators that a few weeks ago there was a report that a scientist working at Lucas Heights had died of cancer and that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission had accepted responsibility to the extent that it was paying compensation to the man’s wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It should endeavour to ensure that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is in a position to act as an honest adviser to the Government on the use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy rather than as an agent for the uranium producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Information about <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy should be given in the market place so that the people of Australia can be concerned and fully informed about the mining of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the $20m which has been spent up to this point of time on research into <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy was spent on research into solar power- a clean renewable safe source of energy- we would be advancing the cause of the Third World countries much further than we are advancing them at the moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this matter, I simply say that the track record of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should give none of us any feeling of confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Later on I shall touch briefly on the subject of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb, which has been mentioned by members of the Opposition, and on the scares that they have about it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said in my opening, we knew what we were in for because of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and we were able to take commensurate safeguards to protect future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  ) What is the total number of deformities and ‘ monster’ births in Japan that are related to the two <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions in  1945. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About  13  per cent of a group of children irradiated in  utero  as a result of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions showed a mean reduction of head circumference at maturity of about  1  centimetre compared with an incidence of about  4  per cent of a like deformity in a control group of Japanese children in  utero  at the time of the explosions but not exposed to radiation doses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand about  3  per cent of a group of children irradiated in  utero  as a result of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions showed evidence of some mental retardation compared with an incidence of about  1  per cent in the control group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As already indicated in answer to pan  1  of the question, in some of the children born of mothers who were pregnant at the time of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosions, effects of a developmental character occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When project Manhatten was going it was obvious that there was a race on to be the first to build that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb before our then enemies did. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about the ease with which an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb could be made I remind the Senate that when the first <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb was made it took hundreds of the top scientists in the world, a blank cheque, and years and years to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770818_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inclusion of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency in the membership of the Fund suggests to me that a decision of the Fund can be made by two-thirds of the majority of members to use the fund for some <span class="highlight">atomic</span> application for better grinding of rice in China or elsewhere in Asia, for example. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ranger Inquiry recommended against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act on the grounds that this legislation was enacted largely with defence considerations in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having reviewed this matter the Government nevertheless considered that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act provides an appropriate basis for mining operations at Ranger in accordance with the agreements concluded between the companies and the Commonwealth in 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In coming to this conclusion, the Government had regard to the view of the Ranger Inquiry that its concern over the appropriateness of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act would have less force if the Uranium Advisory Council recommendation of the Inquiry were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, the working panel which proposed it, drew on a code of practice prepared by the International Labour Organisation and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It took account of recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and discussions in expert panels convened by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It studied papers presented to, and discussions at, an international symposium on radiation protection in mining and milling of uranium and thorium arranged by the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The working panel was aware that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency has in preparation a manual, with explanatory guidelines, on the management of radioactively contaminated wastes and effluents arising in the mining and milling of radioactive ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Cavanagh has asked why it was necessary for the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency to be expressly included in paragraph (a) of Article 3 of the Agreement Establishing the International Fund for Agricultural Development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Cavanagh might be interested to learn of the reason for specifically mentioning the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency in this formulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency ( IAEA ) is an intergovernmental organization and was established in Vienna, Austria, on 29 July 1957. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its main objectives are ‘to seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world ‘ and to ‘ensure so far as it is able, that assistance provided by it or at its request or under its supervision or control is not used in such a way as to further any military purpose’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency is now a fully accepted member of the UN system, it cannot be considered as falling within either of these two categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As soon as serious consideration was given to the establishment of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy agency to be charged with the distribution and control of materials potentially usable in nuclear weapons, it was recognised that such an organization would differ substantially from the specialized agencies, whose concerns, while important, fall squarely within the purview of ECOSOC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770825_senate_30_s74/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it correct that when in government the Australian Labor Party purchased 41.6 per cent of the Mary Kathleen uranium shares through a governmental instrumentality- the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission- using the Australian taxpayers’ money, which percentage represented some 30,764,142 shares in the company, and then appointed  Mr Egerton,  a senior trade unionist, to the Mary Kathleen board to supervise the Labor Party’s interest in the mining of uranium and the production and sale of uranium oxide- yellowcake? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because the major portion of solar research funding is not necessarily directed towards national priorities and because, in my opinion, a disproportionately large amount of research funding is directed towards <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy research, I ask: Has the Government considered this aspect of the report? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770915_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have the Government and its inter- departmental committees finished their study of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry Second Report (Fox Report); if so, when is the Government likely to implement the following recommendation made in the Fox Report: ‘That section 87A(2) of the Northern Territory Mining Ordinance 1939-1976 should be amended so that a uranium mining lease may be forfeited by the Administrator without a recommendation from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span>  Energy Commission ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack would be well aware that I have hammered this subject and have blown my trumpet about the Finniss River and about how irresponsible we were in 1970 when the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission allowed the impregnation of the river with tailings which, again, made it desolate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources by quoting the chief of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency who, at a conference in Vienna on 28 September, said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical assessments by experts in the United States of America- the National Science Foundation/National Aeronautics Space Administration in 1973, <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in 1973, Federal Energy Agency m 1974, NSF in 1974 and the American Petroleum Society in 1975- all broadly agree that a significant fraction of energy supply could be taken up by diverse solar technologies within this century and far more shortly thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting in the 1990s, these solar energy estimates considerably exceeded the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission ‘s most sanguine projections for the contributions of nuclear fission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can provide a very significant amount in lower grade energy needs, out it is wrong to hold out to a public that is becoming more and more aware of the impending crisis that solar energy is an alternative to major development of such energy sources as <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not an alternative to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy and should never be held out as such. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>For instance, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission receives about $20m a year; coal research receives about $4m a year and solar energy research slightly in excess of $lm a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government has not disposed of its shareholding in Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd.

    <p>In other words, notwithstanding the fact that the Victorian Government has revived the 1948 Essential Services Act with all its powers that go far beyond any other piece of legislation bar probably the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1973, and notwithstanding the repressive, excessive powers contained in the Essential Services Act, other workers in the Latrobe Valley are prepared to say that if certain things happen they will join the SEC maintenance workers in the Latrobe Valley. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I presume that the Minister knows that yesterday an allegation was made to the Windscale inquiry in England, an inquiry into aspects of nuclear power industry, by the widow of a former director of the Lucas Heights <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy establishment that 100 lb of pure plutonium and 300 tonnes of highly radioactive waste was dumped at Pine Gap and Maralinga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even Russia, a country which will not be a signatory to the nonproliferation treaty, is doing all it can as a nation in support of the establishment of world banks to handle plutonium from fast breeders because it is concerned that this is the material from which <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs are built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a sufficient spread of realisation of the downturn in the hopes for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, and at the same time the hopes for solar energy look much greater than they were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This statement applies (with minor differences) whether the new energy system should (somewhat recklessly) use up the last remaining coal deposits, indulge in dubiously safe <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, or develop the advantageous solar-hydrogen system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771102_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In view of the two facts that  Mr Justice  Fox has reported, namely, that there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian propositions that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by those countries without the specific approval of supplier countries and that there is concern overseas that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency may not be able to administer nuclear safeguards satisfactorily, how does the Australian Government intend to maintain the fictional assurances given to the Australian people that Australian safeguards will be met completely by overseas takers of our uranium exports? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771103_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the case of Ranger where rnining will be carried on under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides that the determination of amounts, higher than the royalty rate prescribed by section 63 (5) (a) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, will be made jointly by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for National Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-19">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Do the main objections to the Australian nuclear safeguards policy relate to the application of the full International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards, a ban of more than 20 per cent U308 enrichment, and the requirement of prior Australian consent to re-export and re-process Australian uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions for International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards and prior Australian consent to high enrichment reprocessing and retransfer are integral parts of that package, as are the other requirements which have been stated, for example, bilateral agreements with customer countries, proscription of diversion of supplied nuclear material to military and explosive uses and adequate physical security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How will the Australian Government ensure that Aus.tralian safeguards will be completely met by overseas takers of our uranium exports, in view of  Mr Justice  Fox’s report of 29 September 1977, recorded in a Foreign Affairs Departmental minute made public on 2 November 1977, that: (a) there is general opposition overseas to the United States and Canadian proposition that there could be no reprocessing of uranium supplied by these countries without the specific approval of supplier countries; and (b) there is concern overseas that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency may not be able to administer safeguards satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-58-67">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This difficulty has been recognised and a working party consisting of specialists from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the Prince of Wales Hospital and officers of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has been set up to study the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The production and supply of other <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy produced radio pharmaceuticals is unaffected by this one difficulty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reported that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has stated that it is anticipated that between 1980 and 1985 there will be a drop in the demand for uranium of some 36 per cent from the original estimates of production because of delays and revisions caused primarily by environmentalist groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I am advised by my colleague in the other place that the annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the year ended 30 June 1977 stated that Australian sales of uranium to the mid-1980s might amount to between 33,000 tonnes and 55,000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates and advice of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission were, of course, available to the Government in the course of making the decision in relation to the development of Australian uranium resources which was announced to the Parliament on 25 August 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Friday of this week the Committee will visit the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Research Station at Lucas Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has done a lot of work in determining the age of ground water by measuring the relative quantities of various radioactive substances in the water. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was only as a result of the courage of the Senate Water Pollution Committee, in perhaps badgering witnesses, that we learned that the actions of our much-vaunted <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission had, by miscalculation, polluted the Finniss River. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one takes the trouble to look at the latest report issued by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission one will discover that certain echelons of Government have asked the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission whether it can discover the extent of Australia’s underground water supplies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been reported that some 200 to 400 tonnes of uranium ore from the old workings of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at Rum Jungle have been dumped at Snake Creek. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My colleague, the Minister for National Development, who is responsible for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, has advised me that he has instigated an investigation of this matter and has asked for an early report on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also drew the attention of the Minister to the statement of  Mr Duncan  Campbell, a scientific writer, which appeared in most of the national Press yesterday, that in fact the technical and scientific personnel of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission were in some way involved during the orbit of that satellite over Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator mentioned the interests of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Will the Minister representing the Minister for National Development confirm whether two documents which were partially reproduced and extensively quoted in yesterday’s edition of the  Australian  and are purportedly drafts of proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 are authentic? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Committee members also met officers of the Commonwealth National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for National Development a question about the report of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the year ended June 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Senator Thomas has asked whether the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s annual report for the year ended 30 June 1977 indicates that there will be a market for uranium in the 1980s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The estimates and advice of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission were, of course, available to the Government in the course of making a decision in relation to the development of Australian uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that about late October or early November last year when this ore body was found it was considered, after consultation with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, unwise to put the ore into open cuts which already are full of ore and which contain contaminants through leaching from the copper ore body and chemicals which were used in uranium processing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was also considered by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission that it could be well worth while processing the ore when the Alligator River uranium field was established and that, as Rum Jungle had become a popular tourist visitation area and was visited by interstate tourist buses, it would be preferable to remove the ore to another site which was under Commonwealth control, as the honourable senator indicated in his question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that there are a number of theoretically possible processes which might enrich uranium and which are described in the 25th annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The feasibility of the laser enrichment technique has been demonstrated overseas on the milligram scale using <span class="highlight">atomic</span> uranium vapour, but this approach is complicated by the low efficiency of the required lasers, the high temperatures involved and the corrosive nature of uranium vapour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But laser enrichment is a line of research worth following and it has been under investigation by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission since 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Has the Minister representing the Minister for National Development seen critical commentary by the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  reported in last week ‘s South Australian  Sunday Mail  regarding the Federal Government’s proposed legislation to amend the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the first question, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953- that is the existing Act- already makes provision for the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to mine uranium for the purpose of ensuring the provision of uranium for the defence of the Commonwealth or for any other purpose of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fundamental purpose of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill is to enable the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to undertake the functions envisaged for it in relation to the development of the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proposed amendments to the principal Actthat is, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953- will make clear the power of the Commission to engage in the Ranger project in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding dated 28 October 1975 between the Commonwealth Government and Peko- Wallsend Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd. As to the third question asked by  Senator Young,  he will be aware that some time ago the South Australian Government and the Premier showed a keen interest in the question of attracting a uranium enrichment plant to South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#debate-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That allegation was answered in full by the General Manager of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in a press statement of 20 June 1977. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-54-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has he looked at the various reafforestation programs after a period of time or has he, along with many of the other emotional people, just gone into the forest after the initial burn-off when, admittedly, the place looks as though an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb has hit it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780503_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>the incurring of expenditure, by, or on behalf of, the Australian Government and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and other authorities of Australia for and in relation to the development by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in association with Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd of uranium deposits in the Northern Territory of Australia. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will be pleased to know that under the direction of  Mr Robert  Fry, who has been seconded from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to the Department of <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill  1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 as part of a package of legislation giving effect to the Government’s decision on the further development of Australia ‘s uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments to the Act contained in this Bill will enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to participate on behalf of the Commonwealth in a joint venture with Peko/EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, which used the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as its legislative basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity is also being taken to strengthen and clarify the legislative basis for the application of nuclear safeguards within Australia in accordance with the agreement between the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency and Australia in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the Government did not accept the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act not be used for the grant of authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry recommended against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act on the grounds that this legislation was enacted largely with defence considerations in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After reviewing this matter, the Government nevertheless considered that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act could provide an appropriate basis for mining operations at Ranger, in accordance with the agreements concluded between the companies and the Whitlam Government in 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Mr Anthony,  indicated in his statement of 25 August 1977 that in reaching this decision the Government had regard to the view of the Ranger Inquiry that its concern over the appropriateness of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act would have less force if the Uranium Advisory Council recommendation of the Inquiry were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, we are proposing amendments to sections 17 and 34 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which will substantially broaden the basis of the Act and clearly authorise the participation of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the amendments we are proposing provide a clear legal basis on which the Ranger project can be authorised to proceed, but they will also remove the main obstacle that the Ranger Inquiry saw in proceeding with the Ranger project under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By ratifying this most important international instrument, Australia undertook, amongst other things, not to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive safeguards and to accept safeguards applied by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within Australia, under our jurisdiction or carried out anywhere under our control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative base for the control of nuclear materials in Australia is part III of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953, headed ‘Control of Materials ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The national system of accounting for and control of materials was, therefore, established under the Minister responsible for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The body involved, the Australian Safeguards Office, answers directly to the Minister through the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, all nuclear material which is required to be inspected by the IAEA is located within the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary, however, for regulations to be in place to ensure this compliance as the inventory of material for which safeguards are required increases and spreads beyond <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and Government ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 34 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act at present provides that the powers conferred in relation to the control of materials shall be exercised only: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 4, 6 and 7 of the Bill update provisions of the Principal Act relating to staff and officials of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, to bring them into line with current drafting practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, section 31 (2) (b) of the Principal Act is amended to meet the request of the AuditorGeneral that he no longer be required to report on the ‘state of affairs’ of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it is proposed that section 6 1 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act be deleted as it is no longer required in view of recent amendments to the Judiciary Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established a national system of accounting for and controlling nuclear material as required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty and by our safeguards agreement with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The domestic legislative base for giving effect to these obligations has been the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, and will continue to be that Act as amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780508_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications of the amendments to <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and Approved Defence Projects Act for civil liberties are frightening and without precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition will oppose outright the first of these Bills, namely, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 shall concentrate my remarks mostly on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill and subsequent speakers will pay more attention to the second Bill we are debating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if the Opposition were not generally opposed to uranium mining, it would still oppose these Bills, especially the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, for reasons which I shall detail later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>General objections to the mining of uranium or to the movement into the nuclear fuel cycle aside, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill is a most unsatisfactory piece of legislation to use as a vehicle for Government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments to the Act contained in this Bill will enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to participate on behalf of the Commonwealth in a joint venture with Peko/EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, we are proposing amendments to sections 1 7 and 34 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which will substantially broaden the basis of the Act and clearly authorise the participation of the Australia <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in the Ranger Project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has clearly acknowledged that the purpose of this amending legislation to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is commercial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has tacked this commercial purpose or objective on to the principal Act, that is the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953, which incorporates all the sweeping defence powers which the Commonwealth can assert for itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox commission explicitly recommended against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>having reviewed this matter, the Government nevertheless considered that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act provides an appropriate basis for mining operations at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In both the statement of the Prime Minister at that time and in introducing this legislation, the Government has rejected the recommendation of the Fox commission that it would be wrong to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953 for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that Government supporters have said, and that probably Government supporters who subsequently participate in this debate will say, that the Labor Government at some time in the past planned to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have two comments to make in respect of that matter: Firstly, it was not the intention of the Labor Government to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we delve back into the history of what happened just 44 months ago it is more than a little ironic that today the Liberal and National Country Parties should attempt to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953 as the vehicle to cany their uranium mining policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 September 1974, the Senate disallowed regulations proclaimed under the 1953 <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to provide the basis for uranium mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I shall quote some of the statements made by  Senator Durack  at that time about the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for the purpose of providing a legal vehicle for the commercial exploitation of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will quote just one of them at this stage, from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953, section 4 1 . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prescribed substances are uranium, thorium and, I think, any substance containing any of the elements with an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weight above 93-  -and minerals mined or otherwise recovered in pursuance of an authority under this section that are not otherwise the property of the Commonwealth are, by force of this section, vested in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the 1953 Act-  - and the wide powers given under it were, of course, at that time dictated very much by the strategic character of uranium as to its use in the production of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons and the great concern which was held at that time in respect of that subject. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In making that statement  Senator Durack  clearly rejected the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for any purpose other than defence purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Twenty-one of the Liberal Party and National Country Party senators who in 1974 disallowed regulations made under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of 1953 on the grounds inter alia that it was quite improper to use an Act which was primarily a defence Act, or associated with the defence powers of the Commonwealth, for commercial purposes, presumably will all support a Bill which will do precisely that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A prescribed substance is any element with an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weight above 93- if I remember correctly- is or are present on or under the whole or part of an area of land … the Minister may . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they had wanted to protest against the infringement of States’ rights or, more importantly in my view, the gross and scandalous infringements of the rights of the individual and the denial of the most fundamental principles of AngloAustralian jurisprudence, they should have started protesting 25 years ago about the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons I have stated with regard to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, it is quite clear that the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill should be rejected by the Senate, particularly in view of the fact that three and a half years ago Liberal and National Country Party senators rejected regulations made under the Act on the grounds that it was improper to use an Act rooted in the defence powers of the Commonwealth for commercial purposes, and the regulations were disallowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is with pleasure that I enter the debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, which the Senate is debating concurrently with the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate this afternoon is debating two Bills cognately- the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My comments will concentrate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill will facilitate joint participation in the mining of uranium by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953, which we are amending by this Bill, gave the Minister power to exercise control over nuclear materials but only in connection with defence or with a Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I do intend to outline, and to outline forcibly, my personal opposition and that of the Australian Labor Party to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is almost a fait accompli that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill will be passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My basic and overwhelming objection to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the amending Bill which is before us is that they will allow uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sections 44, 45 and 46 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy a dc;il with the communication of restricted information, the acquisition of restricted information and the removal of restricted information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are repressive sections which, taken by themselves and with sections 44, 45 and 46 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, can cause a person to be imprisoned for up to 20 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one is wrongfully detained or arrested under the provisions of this Act, no action lies against the Commonwealth or the State or the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This afternoon we are debating a Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and also the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This package of legislation deals, as I said, with amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, with aspects of the environment in the Alligator Rivers region where the mines are situated, and with Aboriginal land rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard a lot today about the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In answer to comments made earlier by  Senator Colston,  the sort of country which might do that would be the country which wanted to make an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb but could not get any uranium any other way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That estimate comes from an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> industrial forum which was held in the United States in 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workers at the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Research Centre at Lucas Heights in Australia get something like 100 rem of radiation per annum- a rem is a measure of radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Criticism was made today about the fact that we are amending the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, because on a previous occasion we did not support a Labor Bill to amend the Act in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same thing happened with regard to regulations which were proposed by the previous Whitlam Government to be included in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shall grant any necessary and appropriate authorities under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows clearly that the Labor Party was prepared eventually to work by democratic means, not socialistic means, to involve itself in work under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that case the Commission was the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, the government agency- in other words, the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Newman,  the Minister for National Development, stated in his second reading speech on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill that the Prime Minister:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an important point to remember when criticism is continually levelled against the Government because it is making amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way Australia also can have a say with regard to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Agency, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that there has been no haste presents no justification for the Government amending the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act in the way it intends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other night when I was watching television I saw a previous  chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission,  Sir Philip  Baxter, applying himself to a different aspect of this whole problem of nuclear power which, at its fullest projection, will decide the fate of mankind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are still using the term <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, when on all other occasionsexcept in this amending Bill which is the hidden clout in the Act- every other reference is to nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Atomic</span> power- the splitting of the atom- was a great discovery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I place on record my total opposition to this objectionable amendment to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As our society believes that any progress involves a certain degree of risk, we’re going to weigh that risk by asking one basic question: whether the problem of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste has brought us to the threshold of our ability to manage our own plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the Government on these two Bills, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do honourable senators think that the terrorists could get hold of it and make an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb, considering the thousands of scientists that were used in project Manhattan to make the first <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first Bill, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, flies in the face of recommendations from the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, but the Government has decided to use this as an instrument by which the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission can buy into the Ranger project and thus we can keep faith with the Memorandums of Understanding that were laid down by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind them that they know as much about business as they know about <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that work is being done- our own <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at Lucas Heights may be working on this also- whereby a laser process is used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer to some particular provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 that concern me and on which perhaps other honourable senators on this side of the House have not spoken in great detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we regard the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 as being totally inappropriate to control commercial or civil uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is an inappropriate body to be responsible for commercial uranium development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- the report of  Mr Justice  Fox which  Senator Collard  clearly has not read or has disposed of in his mind as being a totally irrelevant document- stated that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 should not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that, in spite of that injunction from  Mr Justice  Fox, the Government wants to continue to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for two specific reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first reason is that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which dates from 1953, contains specific provisions based on the defence power which will offer the Government a means of intimidating and suppressing public opposition to uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are some quite substantial and simply stated objections that we have to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as the vehicle for proceeding with commercial uranium mining in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that the Fox report objected to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act on quite specific grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind honourable senators again that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is based on the defence power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That must be seen again in the context of the remarks made in the Fox report regarding the inappropriateness of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for uranium mining for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, we believe that there could be a very real conflict of interest- the Fox Commission pointed this outbetween the entrepreneurial or commercial activities of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and its responsibilities under the Act to supervise local environmental protection measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are the sorts of simple and fundamental objections which we have to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and to the Bill which is designed to amend that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I again point to the fact that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was designed for quite specific purposes- the political circumstances in 1 953, not the political circumstances in 1 978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was seeking to make some of the same points about this legislation as I sought to make about the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must understand that the Parliament operates in a society in which there should be freedom of discussion and debate on these matters and that persons involved in that process of freedom of discussion and debate should not be subjected to the sort of pernicious powers which are available to the Government under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and which will be available to the Government if the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seemed to me that so long as there was an opportunity for the expression of freedom of opinion about uranium mining in Australia,  Senator Button  would have no objection to it other than that he would not have used the vehicle of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which will be amended by the first Bill that is the subject of the debate tonight, was chosen by the Australian Labor Party when it was in government as the vehicle for the task that it was contemplating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It involved the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in 7216 per cent of the development, Peko Mines Ltd in 13% per cent of the development and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd in 13% per cent of the development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that stage, the Labor Government had chosen the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission as the vehicle for its negotiations, and it had used the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, as it then stood, needed some amendments to enable that Memorandum of Understanding to be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It facilitates the joint participation in the mining of uranium by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the other partners in the mining venture at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is one of the amendments which is sought to be made to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it extremely difficult to believe that Opposition senators could be serious in their professed objections to the Bill amending the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the amending Bill to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act come into the same category. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was conceived originally as a security measure the penalties for breach of it are extremely severe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States maintain objections to the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act similar to those they have in respect of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was brought home to me very clearly by a recent visit to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at Lucas Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I was trying to suggest objectively is that before I visited the Alligator Rivers area I visited the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at Lucas Heights over lunch one of the scientists commented that the glass of wine that  Senator Mulvihill  was drinking at the time was radiating more radiation per moment - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The New York railway station which is built of granite emits many times the amount of radiation that would be permissible for any <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy power station in America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two Bills now being debated cognately are the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment BUI and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill or the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill protect that intimacy? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act we are now seeking to ratify that agreement and extend it into legislative form in order to protect the areas about which we have been talking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to observe that the most stringent safeguards have been set down in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take part in this debate very conscious of the fact that the Government assumes that the Bills- the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978- will establish mechanisms for protecting the health and safety of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here in Australia the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> industry has always assumed that the threshold was 5 rads a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even  Sir Philip  Baxter said recently that it is not necessary for countries to have a nuclear power industry for them to be able to produce <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ford Foundation said that a crude <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb could be produced in a clandestine laboratory with minimum knowhow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion 1 can do no better than to quote from the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry where it looked at the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong body of evidence demonstrates a widespread lack of confidence in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission as the final arbiter of standards for the proposed mining operations, and as monitor of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Maunsell  then said that there was nothing wrong with the dropping of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb on Japan because he walked around the site afterwards and found it quite safe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that fails it will stand ready with the full repressive force of the police state tactics enshrined in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which the Bill now before the House seeks to amend, to suppress openly opposition to the uranium go-ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act ensure that the Government’s safeguards policy will be administered by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to Australian Government statements, the mining of the Ranger deposit will be covered by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend against the use of the Act -  that is, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act-  for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium if mining were approved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to cover uranium mining now makes it an offence for any worker, union or Australian citizen not to comply fully with the mining and the export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act provisions already include those set out in the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1 947 which provides for a fine of up to $10,000 and 12 months gaol. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Bill extends the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act in that respect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I seek your support and co-operation in deferring the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act Amendment Bill until full and proper consultations have taken place at the Premiers Conference due on June 22. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government also wants to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to control opposition to the export of uranium in direct opposition to the recommendations of the Fox inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly urge you to oppose the passage of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill when they come before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We object to the amendments proposed in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill for changes to sections 34 (b) and (c) and 38 (4) on similar grounds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The implications of the amendments to <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and Approved Defence Projects Act for civil liberties are frightening and without precedent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission announced plans to commence a $10m program of nuclear fusion research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst on the one hand mouthing pious sentiments about the need for consultation between State and Federal governments before codes are proclaimed or enforced, the Government has so worded the clauses of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act that, in fact, the States have no rights at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 that are before us disclose a real concern although that may only be in deference to a significant section of public opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then reference is made to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, is based upon only two powers, defence and territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However I have made one or two notes on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill seeks to broaden the principal Act so that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission can participate in the Ranger project and so that uranium mining can proceed under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not accepted the recommendation of the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should not be used as a vehicle for uranium mining in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In dealing with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy (Prescribed Substances) Regulations on 19 September 1974 he had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the motion for the disallowance of the regulations under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 19 September 1974, when dealing with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy (Prescribed Substances) Regulations,  Senator Durack  had this to say when summarising the views of the Opposition of 1974: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate is debating the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a particularly scintillating contribution on the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy legislation the other night he drew a fascinating analogy between the radioactive hazards of a nuclear industry and a glass of wine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that anyone listening to the debate in this chamber or elsewhere tonight would not have been aware that he was talking about the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, which are two important subjects to Australia that do not figure in his dissertation at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill which is being dealt with in this debate jointly with the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been interesting to find out what is the justification for using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953- an Act largely of a defence nature- which set up the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and which places very great power in the hands of the executive Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard it argued that the Australian Labor Party, when it made arrangements about the Ranger field and entered into engagements, had in mind using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think there is some real concern as to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative for Ranger left open by the Land Rights Act is an authority to mine under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong body of evidence demonstrates a widespread lack of confidence in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission as the final arbiter of standards for the proposed mining operations, and as a monitor of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally he drew attention to the security provisions of Part IV of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, some of which seem extreme in the current context but which were doubtless enacted with defence considerations in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to this Act, once again I turn to what I think are the rather serious implications of the application of the original, even amended, <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act itself imports in its terms the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act of 1947. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the various parts of this Act, one sees that there are some very real concerns about the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate is debating the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1 978 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 conjointly, to which the Opposition has moved the following amendment: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such questions arise with particular force in relation to the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite that, I am not in favour of the legislation which is before us- the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill- being passed through the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Senate has been debating at length two Bills, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978, and I thank honourable senators for their contributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first Bill, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, will enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to participate on behalf of the Commonwealth in a joint venture with Peko/EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to understand that the first Bill will give us the opportunity to strengthen and clarify the legislative basis for the application of nuclear safeguards within Australia in accordance with the agreement between the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency and Australia in connection with the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As has just been established, the main Bill in the package is the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Philippines is a party to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), has a safeguards agreement with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency (IAEA) in connection with the NPT and is a member of the IAEA. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have not been successful in our opposition to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill which in fact permits uranium mining to proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has been very prominent in the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at Lucas Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was very impressed when I visited the Lucas Heights establishment of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to learn that the Commission itself has been studying the environment of the Kakadu area over a period of years and certainly recognises the fragility of the environment, particularly in the wet season when the floods can occur. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We heard the same type of thing the other day when we dealt with amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even our own <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has reported that demand for Australia ‘s uranium by the mid-1980s will be drastically down on past estimates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am advised that the discussions between officials indicated that the States were most concerned about two of the six Bills introduced into the Parliament last month- the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not proposed to make any amendment to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill at this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it provides a firm legal basis for an authority under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for Ranger to mine, and it is essential that Ranger proceed this dry season. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said the other day when I spoke to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, it will be far too late when the mines are fabricated and operating because the Government, if it is then proved that it does not have the necessary safeguards will not have the fortitude to prevent the mining companies from going ahead because they will have too big a hold on the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 reported without amendment; Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill 1978 reported with amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the motion for the third reading I wish to introduce a factor which may not have been considered, merely, that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Energy Amendment Bill clearly contravenes Article 14 (II) of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights of the United Nations, which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the aspects of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which should be noted in relation to the erosion of basic civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 47 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which is not being amended by the current amendments and which will stand in relation to the commercial operations at Ranger, is particularly damaging in the context of the erosion of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the use of section 44 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which relates to communication of restricted information with intent to prejudice defence, contravenes Articles 18, 19 and 21 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, which deal with freedom of speech and assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contradictions between section 44 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act being applied to a commercial development and the Covenant are striking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the Covenant proclaims these basic rights of speech and freedom, whilst, on the other hand, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as it is applied to Ranger would impose a penalty of 20 years imprisonment for a person communicating certain aspects of the Ranger development to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, section 60 which applies to the application of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1 947 to any works carried out by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and therefore including Ranger, effectively prevents any speechwriting or strike action in opposition to works undertaken by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The terms of section 60 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act make it clear that the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act provisions apply to any works of the Commission without the need for the gazettal which is otherwise required by section 3 of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, these objections which I raise to sections of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which will be used in relation to uranium mining at Ranger clearly illustrate the contradictory stand on civil liberties by the Government and the use of extreme powers, which were employed in the Cold War period of the 1 940s, with respect to a commercial development in the late 1970’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Georges would know, the provisions which he has outlined have been in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for 25 years- since 1953- and various governments have known that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that in any defensive way because I think that, now that particular aspects of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act may be used, it is a good time to reflect and to amend if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I must say after sitting in on several Estimates committee meetings- I am thinking in particular of the estimates for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission- that I have noted the effect of the numerical ceiling having a particular impact on organisations carrying on research and development at the skilled tradesman or technician level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781024_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee was particularly concerned with the situation at the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission where radio isotope production, which is a commercial undertaking of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, and potential sales are being hampered as a result of the operation of staff ceilings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are not talking about government cutbacks and savings in government expenditure but about investment in labour in an area where there will be a return on investment and further revenue for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee drew particular attention to the situation with regard to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the fact that its most recent report was not available for reasons which were not, on the face of it, the fault of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I mention also under the heading of staffing that there has been a great deal of concern expressed by the relevant union, the Association of Architects, Engineers, Surveyors and Draughtsmen of Australia, that the staff ceilings and staff cuts which have been imposed at the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission research establishments are adversely affecting a variety of areas of work including safety operations and certainly including environmental controls and studies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point that I make about the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is that it certainly appeared from the detailed discussion at the Estimates Committee, which I do not here rehearse with any elaboration, that the Australian Safeguards Office is a complete farce and charade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is and must remain a matter of concern that the Australian Safeguards Office clearly is not perceived to be in any way independent of the governmental structure; it is absorbed within the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781115_senate_31_s79/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This involves a binding undertaking not to manufacture nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards on the Republic of Korea’s nuclear industry to verify that material is not diverted from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781116_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the Press statement of the Minister for National Development announcing the formation of the Division of Environmental Science within the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781117_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has had considerable administrative experience within the Government bureaucracy, was <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Adviser to the High Commissioner in London for three years and has served on a number of international panels and committees concerned with the environmental and public health aspects of nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a number of years he has chaired an Advisory Group to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency which has formulated limits and controls on the dumping of radioactive wastes in the ocean as required by the international ‘Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter’ and was associated with the development of the Agency’s regulations relating to the safe transport of radioactive materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-71-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1977 the Government announced its policy to develop the uranium ore deposits in the Ranger project area on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding of October 1975 which provided for mining to be undertaken under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd as joint venturers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard honourable senators will recall that in June this year the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was amended to authorise the participation of the Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legally binding agreements to implement the Memorandum of Understanding are now being negotiated to establish the Joint Venture and thus enable an authority’ to mine to be issued under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger joint venturers have pointed out that section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, as it presently stands, does not provide them with adequate security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government of course, also believes that the holders of an authority under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should not be disadvantaged in respect of such an important matter as security of tenure in comparison with prospective competitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 will introduce two new sections into the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, namely 41 A and 4 IB. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, the Bill deals with section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, the section under which an authority to mine uranium is granted by the Minister for Trade and Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Joint Venturers have pointed out that section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, as it presently stands, does not provide them with adequate security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third consequence of the legislation is that, as far as assignments of interests are concerned, the 1974 memorandum of understanding gave pre-emptive weight to the right to purchase, in the case of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s interest, to Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd; and in the case of Peko ‘s interest, to EZ, and vice versa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the inappropriateness of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to regulate a commercial operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox Ranger Inquiry report was very critical of the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the severe security provisions of that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is again a reference to the history of this matter and the undesirability of using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for commercial purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Might I say at the outset that I was not surprised at the reaction of the Opposition to the proposed amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an important area because at present, as the Ranger venturers have pointed out that under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act there is no provision whatsoever for adequate security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shall grant any necessary and appropriate authorities under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the introduction of these amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act amounts to an admission by the Government of how inappropriate this Act is as the legislative framework for the development and exploitation of uranium within Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This conclusion of mine is not simply something to be deduced from the provisions of the Bill; it is quite explicit in the admission by the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony),  in his second reading speech in another place where he says, of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, that provisions to cover mining on a commercial basis were never included. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That disenchantment with the Minister in another place is understandable because, as I say, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is quite inappropriate as as vehicle for the exploitation of mining of uranium for peaceful purposes and for commercial profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would go further and say that not only is the legislative framework as a whole inappropriate and totally inadequate to deal with the situation but also that the decision of the Government to continue using this Act in the face of the admitted inadequacy alerts us to a possible further reason for maintaining the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as the legislation governing the development of the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is in plain contradiction to the views expressed by the Ranger Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a fatal flaw, a comprehensive flaw, distributed throughout the whole of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I really think that if one outlines some of the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, the answer to both questions emerges. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be, too, that under section 60 of this Act, the whole Ranger project has become an Approved Defence Project because of the contribution by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission of working capital for the project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must be the explanation for the Government continuing with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as the legislative framework for the development of the Ranger project, despite the very clear recommendation against it by the Ranger Inquiry Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am coming to the end of my remarks and I hope that honourable senators perceive why it is that the Opposition finds that merely to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is in no way to ameliorate the situation created by its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I support the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the provisions of the old <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy legislation, which I think was introduced in 1945, relating to the mining of uranium, it is obvious that that legislation is quite outmoded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think many people have really forgotten that the mining of uranium in the Northern Territory is not something new but really commenced many years ago, in the late 1940s or early 1950s, at Moline east of Katherine and at Batchelor, Rum Jungle, where the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission developed uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I oppose the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are typically nations which, based on their known records, might not be at all averse to acquiring a number of dirty atom bombs- that is, high fall-out type atom bombs, the sort of crude device which can be produced in association with an ordinary power reactor at quite low cost and with access to quite limited technologyprecisely the type of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapon which was produced by India through the use of its Candu reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in decades to come some of our fuel returns to us in the form of crude and dirty <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs with their inevitable very high fallout rate, we shall have only ourselves to blame. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I quote from the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Already the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has a new Environmental Division. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply- The Opposition, supported by the Australian Democrats, has used this Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as a vehicle to debate and to oppose the Government’s policy to permit the mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been found that the existing provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which provide for an authority to mine under that Act, and which were drawn in completely different circumstances many years ago, are not appropriate to deal with authorities to be given for the commercial operation of uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the fact of the matter is that the Government inherited from its predecessor, the Labor Government, a memorandum of understanding between the Government and uranium mining companies under which a joint venture operation was to be carried on under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why the Government has proceeded with this joint venture agreement under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it a fact that staff ceilings have placed in jeopardy a wide range of safety checks at the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission research establishment at Lucas Heights? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-97-10">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also met representatives of all the political parties as well as leaders in the steel, <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, electronics, motor vehicle and fishing industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#debate-71">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like so much of the industrial legislation for which this Government has been responsiblethe establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau; the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act significantly increasing the scope of the punitive or penal powers under that legislation; and the Commonwealth Employees Act vesting powers of suspension, stand down or dismissal of public employees engaged in just about any conceivable form of industrial action; specific provisions of legislation like the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, aimed quite specifically and directly at particular forms of legitimate trade union protest- this Bill is just another crude and vulgar piece of legislative union-bashing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-86-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What evidence, if any, is there to support public assertions in the letter columns of the  Medical Journal of Australia  of a possible link between the Monte Bello <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests of two decades ago and the later development of some forms of neoplastic disease? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The likelihood that there is a genuine correlation between radiation fall-out and the Monte Bello <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests is very small because of the measured negligible radiation dose to the community mentioned in the  Medical Journal of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the early 1970s, <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power seemed the logical energy source for the last quarter of the century and utility companies ordered an average of 30 reactors a year to run their electricity generating plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Last year’s annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission stated that Australia could sell 10,000 tonnes of uranium in 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that there are nations which have been shown to be lacking in responsibility as far as world peace is concerned and who have the money and the determination to obtain the plutonium which is the inevitable product of the nuclear power industry and which is also the major ingredient of dirty forms of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs in terms of fallout. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790307_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we must add to that the fact that,  during the currency of and after the French nuclear bomb tests in the Pacific, there was a very heavy <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fallout in many parts of north Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those words ‘obstructing, hindering or interfering’ occur quite regularly throughout the statute books dealing with criminal law, industrial law and in legislation like the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April 1977, and much closer to home, there was an incident at the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I recognise the fact that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has never admitted responsibility publicly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Briefly, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow moneys from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and to give security and issue securities in respect of borrowings other than from the Commonwealth, to enable the Treasurer to guarantee repayment by the Commission of moneysborrowed other than from the Commonwealthand to provide that where securities are issued by the Commission, repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In this regard, honourable senators will recall that in June last year, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was amended to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to participate on behalf of the Commonwealth in a joint venture with Peko-EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They will also recall that on 9 January 1979 the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  signed the agreements and issued an authority under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to give effect to the Memorandum of Understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In his Budget Speech of 15 August 1978, the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  noted that a certain proportion of the Commonwealth’s share of the costs of developing the Ranger uranium deposits would be raised by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission through borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing provisions in section 27 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act are inadequate to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow moneys on the semi-government market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some weeks ago I watched a television program in which the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission establishment at Lucas Heights was discussed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I took this matter up during the sittings of Senate Estimates Committee F.

    <p>A television station that should be accepting its responsibilities and putting both sides of the argument saw fit to give one side and to ignore some of the most responsible men in Australia who could have put a counter argument not so much about whether Lucas Heights is good, bad or indifferent, but rather about how <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy affects the community generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790528_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Having reached that point- having dealt with those two Bills- surely it is unreasonable to expect us to go on to the remainder of the program for today, namely, the first reading debate on wine Bills and the second reading debate on wine Bills and then the debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite true that when the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission mined uranium some 25 years ago it did not engage in the safeguards and the environmental controls that are engaged in today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Only last November the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  walked into the House of Representatives and admitted that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was a totally unsatisfactory vehicle for the commercial exploitation of uranium in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this chamber, a mere 7 months later, we are confronted by yet another amendment designed to remedy the latest defect discovered in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s ability to manage the development of this Australian energy source. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that the introduction of these further amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act amounts to a further damning admission by this Government of how inappropriate this Act is as the legislative framework for the development and exploitation of uranium within Australia, particularly as it is claimed to be developed for- I believe this to be the casepeaceful purposes and commercial profit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Fox inquiry commissioners recommend against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as a legislative framework for the development of our uranium resources? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This must be the explanation for the Government’s continuing with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as a legislative framework for the development of the Ranger project despite the very clear recommendations made against it by the Ranger inquiry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not good enough to say, as I have no doubt  Senator Young  will say, that the Labor Administration envisaged using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as the legislative framework for the development of those resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My remarks made clear to honourable senators our general objection to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act even as it is proposed to be amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now move to the amendment to the Act, which briefly is to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow moneys and issue securities, which are guaranteed by the Treasurer on behalf of the Commonwealth, to raise funds for the capital costs for the Ranger project in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission will contribute 72 V4 per cent, the Peko company will contribute 13% per cent and the EZ company will also contribute 13% per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s fundamental point concerning this amendment is that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission ought not continue to combine the functions of a research establishment, a regulatory and safeguards body and a commercial operator with respect to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy materials or processes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its leader, the future Prime Minister, Bill Hayden, has very properly and constructively responded to an advertisement in the national Press calling for submissions to the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council inquiry into research and development activities of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst other things, it proposed that the current functions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission be divided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition proposes that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act be repealed and replaced by legislation to give effect to a number of proposals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, a new government corporation should be established to take over the present commercial activities of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, such as the production and marketing of radio-isotopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other research functions currently being performed by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission ought to be performed as appropriate by a nuclear science authority with projects funded by a national fuel and energy commission, consistent with research and development priorities determined for a national energy policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be allocations of funds to commercial as opposed to regulatory sections within the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, the Opposition will oppose the amendments provided in the Bill which continue to try to give to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commissioners conflicting roles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration suggested in very moderate language that there may well be a case for reconsidering the form, structure and the functions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition says that the commercial exploitation for peaceful purposes of uranium energy resources at Ranger or elsewhere, if it is to be undertaken by any statutory authority whether in partnership or alone, ought to be undertaken by a body with a charter for entrepreneurial activities only- certainly not by the presently constituted Commission within the framework of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am very concerned that the terms of reference of the NERDDC inquiry may have predetermined that the Government will make the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission the central authority for a wide range of research activities in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition says that rather than the types of energy research undertaken by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission being expanded, the Commission should do what it does best- that is, nuclear research- as a nuclear science authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conflict of roles within the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act needs to be resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should not be empowered to raise funds on the commercial market for uranium mining until such time as the unresolved problems associated with the nuclear industry have been satisfactorily resolved; and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is an inappropriate legislative basis for nuclear energy research and development and for commercial activities and should be repealed and replaced by legislation to establish: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This afternoon we are dealing with amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Government pointed out in August 1978, there is a need for the Commonwealth to share a proportion of the cost in developing the Ranger uranium deposits to which  Senator Tate  has referred this afternoon and that these funds would be raised by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission through borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow monies from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and to give security and issue securities in respect of borrowings other than from the Commonwealth, to enable the Treasurer to guarantee repayment by the Commission of monies- borrowed other than from the Commonwealth- and to provide that where securities are issued by the Commonwealth, repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, because of many of these things, amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act are necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main thrust of the Opposition’s argument so far today has been that it is opposed to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s having itself involved in any way in commercial dealings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now a silly situation in which, under the Ranger uranium consortium arrangement, the Government has the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission out seeking markets for its half of Ranger’s production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, it is spelt out very clearly and concisely that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission will be sole agent for the selling of uranium but that the other two partners, the two companies, could sell other minerals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps one could go further and refer to the Twenty-third Annual Report of 1 974-75 for the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the Senate again that this is the report of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission dealing with the year 1974-75 when the Whitlam Government was in power and the Commission was working under the policies of the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all fairness to  Senator Tate,  we have previously heard the Labor Party argue on other aspects of mining, not just the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, but other aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-He made it clear in that statement that they will have to turn to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are going to turn to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, then countries with uranium must supply that uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of these energy gaps, because of the need for Australia to play its part in supplying uranium, and because of the need for us to back up the safeguards laid down by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  soon after we came into power, it has been necessary for us again to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act so as to allow the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to play its part as a commercial partner with the other two partners in the Ranger consortium, Whilst we are hearing criticism from the Opposition today, this Government is merely applying those safeguards and making the Act efficient so that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission can become an efficient partner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly oppose the amendment, not just because it is proposed by the Opposition and not just because I do not think it is necessary, but because the Opposition, to be quite honest, is not really concerned about amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise to oppose this Bill which would enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow money on the open money market to finance the development of the Ranger uranium deposit and the Ranger uranium mine in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are critical of the Government’s determination to develop Ranger, we are critical of the Government’s use of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for this purpose, and we are certainly critical of the Government for persisting in its efforts to mine and export uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indicative of the difficulty and the trouble the world is having in finding any real solution to the disposal of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Japanese <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission planned to have 100,000 MW of nuclear power installed by 1990. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that is partly because they work under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I will speak very briefly- in fact only for about ten minutes- in support of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a later date, when I have a bit more time, I will go a bit more deeply into the background of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and expand on its great significance to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been some recent ill-informed criticism of the whole operation of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the present circumstances in Australia, given the high capital cost of the nuclear industry and given the scarcity of trained scientific workers in this field, the type of operation we are running at the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at the present time from a management point of view is the best that we can do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill deals with the commercial activities of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and it sets up a base on which the Commission can give loan guarantees and things of that nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is relevant to look at the commercial activities of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission up until the present time because they have been of enormous benefit to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The figures that I shall quote are based on an extrapolation of data published by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those few descriptions of the commercial applications of the work of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission demonstrate the great benefit of the Commission to Australia and the air of responsibility with which it has judged its efforts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a later date when more time is available I would like to develop more fully in the Senate the case of the scientific basis under which the management of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is operated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill that the Senate is discussing is designed to allow the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow money so that it may enter into a partnership with Peko Mines Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd in the Ranger uranium project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would like to see a sensible division of powers, because of the changing circumstances in which the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission now operates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s charge of $18 an hour is an imposition on the taxpayers of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of my visit to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, at the public briefing that is commonly held at these public relations sessions, I asked whether in fact this figure was an accurate one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply cannot believe that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission would have the temerity to introduce such a policy itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn to the 1977-78 annual report of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My query is as to why it does not pay those prices to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and why the Government allows that situation to continue, then comes to us and wants us to approve the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s entering into another big business enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the Government to look hard at its priorities and to try to straighten out this matter before it comes to the Senate and asks it to approve the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission ‘s entering into other business undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must, of course, consider the possibility that the Government provides these chemical and forensic services at very low cost to popularise the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, to make it seem a very busy organisation with its services very much in demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn my attention to another aspect of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission which seems uneconomic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I visited the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission I was told, for instance, that a complex and delicate chemical analysis of three pubic hairs was carried out to obtain evidence for a rape case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of that, the Australian Democrats would like to see the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission transformed into an energy department so that the expert people it employs who are not specialist particles physicists can devote their efforts to other sources of energy that, although we have made some important startsand I must give the Government credit for that- we are still substantially neglecting in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Opposition ‘s amendment opposes the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission as the instrument for the development of the Ranger deposits by the Peko-EZ consortium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It gives the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission power to borrow moneys for the commercial arrangements which have already been entered into and to carry out decisions which have long since been made by the Government and about which there has been considerable progress in implementation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Young  pointed out, the decision to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the purpose of developing the Ranger uranium resource was taken by the Labor Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was their decision to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the development of Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Young  has pointed out, they had grandiose schemes for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in the commercial development of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government has honoured the arrangements that were entered into by those companies with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the Labor Government’s doctrinaire socialistic policies and mismanagement we are lumbered with this arrangement with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we came to implement the arrangement we discovered that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission lacked the legal powers to carry it out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It did not consider the morrow at all and it did not consider whether the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission had the legal powers or not. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had to bring down a series of amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to enable this commercial arrangement entered into by the Labor Government to be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other powers have been given under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to give effect to the agreements that had been entered into. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It simply enables the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow funds that are necessary for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition’s amendment sets out its theory of how the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should be split into three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Government has asked the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Council to consider the research and development activities of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any question of altering the powers or structure of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission will be considered by the Government when it has received that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be quite absurd to embark upon such a major revamping and restructuring of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission before that important report is received. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790606_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 43 of the Ranger Uranium Agreement signed on 9 January 1979 sets out procedures for the disposal of the interest of any party in the project, and provides that before disposing of its interest, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission- which is, of course, the Government body involved- must give the other partners, Peko and EZ, a first right of refusal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mining and minerals (including gases and hydrocarbon fuels but excluding the mining of uranium or other prescribed substances within the meaning of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 and regulations under that Act as in force from time to time); <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government endorses the importance of those nuclear safety standards which have been and may be agreed upon in international discussions in forums such as the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790821_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-86-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer to the statement made in the Senate by  Senator Carrick  on 29 May 1978 relating to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 in respect of commercial uranium operations and its effect on civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In response to debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978,  Senator Carrick,  on behalf of the Minister for National Development, stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that particular aspects of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act may bc used, it is a good time to reflect and amend if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recall the statement made by the Leader of the Government,  Senator Carrick,  in response to the debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill in 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790822_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inquiries had to be made of the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Transport, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, the Department of Defence and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission (AAEC) is the only other Commonwealth agency known to be discharging wastes into the Georges River system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that is the raw material of nuclear power and of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stress the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb aspect particularly because I feel that a distinction should be drawn between more sophisticated nuclear weapons such as the hydrogen bomb, which holds the so-called balance of terror, and the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The world has gone through what could be called a very bad scene over dirty nuclear weapons of a small size, which were in effect the type of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we, and the Government, are so naive as not to believe that Australia is going to play its part in this dismal affair and lead the world into this endless proliferation of dirty, small <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons, then I suggest that we are all a great deal more naive than we should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Is the Minister for Science and the Environment aware of a report carried by the Australian Press earlier this month that an accident at the French Muroroa Atoll <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing range may have been responsible for several deaths, a number of other casualties and a minor tidal wave? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790829_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency should now be given monitoring responsibilities over the enrichment of uranium to make certain that highly enriched uranium- the 90 per cent level, the bomb material- is not being produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw the Minister’s attention to this morning’s Press report concerning the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s ordering the immediate closure of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fuel fabrication plant in Tennessee, which reported the loss of uranium suitable for making nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is a general lack of debate in the community of a rational nature about <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, what it means, how safe it is, what its prospects are and whether it is worthwhile as part of the intellectual debate about science policy in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 29 August this year I asked the Minister for Science and the Environment  (Senator Webster)  whether he was aware of a report carried by the Australian Press earlier in the month that an accident at the French Mururoa Atoll <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing range may have been responsible for several deaths, a number of other casualties and a minor tidal wave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After these accidents in July, the French Polynesian Territorial Assembly, the popularly elected representatives of the people who live in the area, resolved that the French Government had to suspend <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing at Mururoa until a Territorial commission of inquiry had carried out its own inquiry into safety at the site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission direct its attention urgently to this matter, expecially since the levels of alpha radiation that can be regarded as safe are very much a matter of dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a fact that in Washington State there are wastes which are the result of the United States <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb program and which have been in short term storage for 30 years or more. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once one has committed oneself anywhere in the world to having nuclear waste in storage one also has a security problem because of the risk of criticality and subsequent <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion of plutonium stored as waste or as a result of deliberate action by states or criminal individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I would like to point out through you,  Mr President,  to honourable senators that there is a very wide range of opinion that an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion did occur in northern Russia which has been kept secret and which was a result of a small amount of plutonium stored in trenches coming together accidentally and reaching a critical stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might say in relation to an answer by the Minister earlier that it is to be hoped the Minister will ask AIRAC to get a balanced point of view on  Dr Roy’s  controversial alleged method which he claims will neutralise <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wish to refer to some answers that I have received from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in response to my questions when its officers came before Senate Estimates Committee B. I asked those questions because of my concern about certain things that were stated and recorded in the Senate  Hansard  of 29 August. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On reading it I was very concerned at some of the items that had been included and took it up with the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having made inquiries from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission the Committee eventually received a reply as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason I bring this matter up tonight is that although I accept that, as I have said, there are people who are opposed- for reasons they think justified- it concerns me that members of this place should purposely set to work to have incorporated in  Hansard  statements which, as the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has said, are misleading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As set out in Annex 1 to the report of Estimates Committee B, at page 23, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission replied further as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer received from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission stated emphatically: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one turns to annex 2 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s explanation one sees the heading ‘Random examples of quotations out of context, incomplete or of no nuclear health and safety implication’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inquiries with the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission revealed that the deaths were caused by steam burns and that radioactivity was not significant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable senators that they should look at the report of Senate Estimates Committee B and read the factual answers given by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission are responsible people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would rather take notice of what people in the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission tell me than take notice of inserts like this in the Senate Hansard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My first question to him is whether, accepting for the moment the good faith of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, it had available to it the report to the United States  President  resulting from the Harrisburg incident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A further and perhaps more pertinent matter regarding the manner of  Senator Young’s  presentation was his use of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to bolster his own political view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has a combination of functions to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Labor Party maintains that the research effort in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy in Australia ought to be hived off and separated from the entrepreneurial effort and, of course, that safeguards ought to be in the hands of a completly independent and impartial body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, as to the actual scientific status of the remarks that  Senator Young  bestowed upon us concerning an important accident, all he was able to say and all the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission said- on which he built so much of his argument- was that the Commission could say with reasonable certainty that it knew the cause of a particular accident which by some has been ascribed to a serious breakdown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I come finally to  Senator Tate’s  point in relation to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April 1977 Australia’s first victim died as a result of being exposed to radiation at the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission ‘s nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 1977 at Maralinga four Commonwealth policemen died of cancer after working at the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb test site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer, of course, to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791122_senate_31_s83/#debate-94">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of radioactive materials, the requirements are based on  the  International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency regulations Tor the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-81">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In respect of (d) an importer of radioactive chemicals for industrial use must obtain a permission to import from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-108">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators I, on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen),  present the text of the agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of Japan for co-operation in the peaceful uses of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720308_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
