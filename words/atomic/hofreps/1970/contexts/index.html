  <li>
    <p>The Minister for National Development will recall a question being asked in this House recently regarding a paper which was to be presented to the Management Symposium on Ecology, Technology and Resources by some officers of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>House that some officers of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission - Messrs Davy, Giles and Charash - bad been asked to prepare and deliver this paper at the symposium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The design of the building w ll be such as to provide a measure of protection from <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fall-0:,t in accordance with practices discussed with the Director of Civil Defence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When generating authorities decide to install nuclear power plants in their own systems they will almost certainly call tenders on a world wide basis as the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has done in the case of the Jervis Bay project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is a Commonwealth instrumentality and conforms to Government policy and practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he make an early statement on precautions to be taken to prevent, or at least to assess, the costs and benefits of the Jervis Bay reactor plans as compared with alternative power projects including (a) the risks of a major plant accident (however unlikely) and radioactive ore transport leakage pollution, (b) radioactive waste disposal techniques and their long-term effectiveness, (c) environmental ecology, (d) the cost factor of safety provisions and (e) the independence of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Authority from profitability motives or influence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the matters mentioned in the statement include the effectiveness of the Treaty, the security guarantees given by the nuclear weapons parties, the nature and content of the safeguard agreements with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy and the right of non-nuclear weapons parties to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-16-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did Messrs Davy, Miles and Charash of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, ever agree to present  a  paper to a symposium organised by the Ecological Society of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was an objection by a member of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission the reason for the withdrawal of this paper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Did the Australian Broadcasting Commis-sion consult any authorities on the subject other than the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What was the cost of the programme to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it coincidence that the programme was shown on the date of tabling of the annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-52-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But around this measure there is - and I am speaking of the parent measure; the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953  -  a strong flavour of the Oak Ridge mentality when it was presumed by one world power that it had a complete monopoly and would be able to retain a complete monopoly of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy and its application to explosives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, what is the effect on the underwriting arrangements with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>Pursuant to section 31 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1973 I present the annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the year ended 30 June 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751104_reps_29_hor97/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some facts were pointed out, I believe correctly, by the former  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission,  Sir Philip  Baxter, in an article in the  Sydney Morning Herald  of last Tuesday about uranium when he said: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760218_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I preface my question to the  Deputy  Prime Minister by drawing his attention to the fact that the French <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, through one of its subsidiaries, has applied for an exploration licence to search for uranium in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: Did the French <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission make this application with the approval of the Federal <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would the Federal Government grant an export licence to the French <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to export uranium in any form if the application in New South Wales was successful and uranium was subsequently found? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760324_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, have Australian officials, such as the former Chairman of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, ever reported that they have been threatened by senior Japanese officials that if their country could not get uranium they would be entitled to come and get it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did  Sir Philip  Baxter report these threats to the Minister responsible for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760824_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister to come into this House tonight and to give honourable members an assurance that when the Government sites the new <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor- it has announced that there will be a new one- it will site it in some area in the wastelands of Australia and not within the densely populated regions of the Sydney metropolitan area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy in this matter was made clear during the debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Act 1978 in the Senate on 29 May 1978 and was repeated in my answer to Question No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consistent with this policy, the Government has decided to amend section 60 of the Act to provide for prior notification of those ‘works’ of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to which the provisions of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 will apply, and to repeal sections 54 and 58 in Pan IV of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790829_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-5">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>References dealing with dam construction, eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle; forestry development, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s proposed nuclear power station, research into wild life and marine science are all relevant to the degradation of our environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behind it all is the grey eminence or the evil genius, if you like, of this Government and the Prime Minister, namely, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should hope that we would use our defence funds and endeavour to secure for this country some measure of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> or hydrogen defence  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to know what this Government is really up to we can have a look at the specifications in the letter of invitation which was circulated last December by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to ten countries that are capable of producing nuclear reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Natural uranium processed in an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor is the short cut to plutonium, which in its turn is the base of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is noteworthy that less than 18 months ago a certain gentleman named Cunningham, who is the V ice-Chairman of the British <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, came to this country and warned it that there had been a breakthrough by the combined experiments of Britain, West Germany and Holland in the use of the gas centrifuge, which was a much cheaper method of enriching uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any country that is bent upon securing plutonium for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons by this purpose has to interrupt the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> cycle of reaction, because when one goes beyond uranium 239 one comes to other trans-uranic elements, namely, neptunium and americium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We believe that the people in the Pacific area are entitled to lead their lives free from the fear of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> fallout or some sort of harm to their way of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700407_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A submarine can stand out to sea a few miles and send an <span class="highlight">atomic</span>, nuclear or hydrogen rocket into such cities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the attention of the Minister for National Development been drawn to the fact that in the last week 2 papers to be delivered to symposiums by employees of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission have been cancelled? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the reasons for the apparent attempt by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to suppress public debate on these issues? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all1, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission did not give any instructions in relation to a paper that was to be presented to this symposium, as has been mentioned by the honourable member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700505_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think most honourable members who did physics or chemistry, or whatever the subject was called in those very neutral days of 20 years ago before <span class="highlight">atomic</span> physics loomed on the horizon, used the formula 5/9ths minus 32 or 5/9ths plus 32 to convert from centigrade to fahrenheit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I can assure the honourable member that the standards which are adopted here not only Will conform to our rigid standards, to which we subscribe through the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, but will be in accordance with the world standards which are laid down by the world agency, the chair-, man of which at the moment is the  chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700602_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Republic of Germany has not applied for membership of the United Nations, lt is, however, a member of all thirteen United Nations Specialised Agencies and of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, and of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency (IAEA). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700605_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-23-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Minister for External Affairs: Has his attention been drawn to the claims in Adelaide by a  Dr Robertson  that there seems to be a correlation between earthquakes and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700609_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have stated in this House on previous occasions that the standards which are laid down by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission on behalf of the Government are as high as those in any other country, and indeed certain standards are higher. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We in Australia should be proud that at the moment the  chairman  of the world agency is an Australian - the  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700611_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>however, it will be necessary to revise this analysis when tenders for the Nuclear Steam Supply System have been received and assessed by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and its consultants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has always been active in seeking to promote a better public understanding of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700612_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-115-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reports to which the honourable member has referred are confidential studies by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales prepared for management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-39-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Department of the Interior are maintaining close liaison to ensure that any disturbance of the area occasioned by the construction of the power station will be as small as possible., thus minimising any effect on the aesthetics and general character of the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700819_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-39-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were spoken to by an Indian who described to us in a lay way the pulsing quasars that they have found as timed against the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> clock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The building of this world class telescope and the prospect of the new <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor at Jervis Bay should have a profound and favourable effect on the brain drain amongst these young scientists and this will help Australia to maintain its position in astronomical research in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700821_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[ would be happy to discuss these matters with him at any time or to arrange for him to discuss them with officers of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of sites were investigated and ultimately the decision was made to select the Jervis Bay site which was considered not only by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission but by the Elec tricity Commission of New South Wales to be the best available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other principal benefit to be gained is that it will provide a training ground for personnel not only from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission but also from the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An amount of $2.4 m is provided for expenditure by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in connection with the proposed nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Estimates given by  Sir Phillip  Baxter,  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, anticipate the expenditure of at least $5, 000m on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power stations by the turn of the century. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission may have this information, but this 1 am inclined to doubt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first question I pose is this: Why has this project become so urgent and what has caused this sudden burst of activity on the part of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt will be appreciated mat I am not in a position to confirm or deny the figures  provided by  Mr Ross,  but the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should be, and I think it is up to the Minister to provide the House with similar estimates prepared by the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The only body in Australia which seems to know those answers - and I again query whether it knows them all - is the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government, through the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, has kept a close watch on the world development of nuclear power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The break into such a new technology is not easy and the Government felt that, since Australian expertise in nuclear energy was largely confined to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, there might be a case for the first step to be taken by the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We anticipate that the power station will attract a large number of visitors and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is making special arrangements so that this unique development in Australia can be seen by as many citizens of Australia as possible, under conditions which will be safe, informative and comfortable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that Canadian nuclear power experts are claiming that the only tender for the nuclear power station at Jervis Bay which can be costed accurately is the tender submitted by <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy of Canada Ltd for a CANDU type reactor using natural uranium? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government proposes to cap it all by secrecy and backdoor methods, because for its 1970 election gimmick it will be announcing the acceptance of a tender to construct an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor at Jervis Bay of an outmoded type and in an unsuitable location. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the reason for the delay in answering them when it is reasonable to assume that all the information sought would and should have been available to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Government prior to the decision to build a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, the European Nuclear Energy Agency and many other governmental and non-governmental bodies periodically publish figures on estimated unit costs for the production of electricity for projected nuclear power stations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission prepared similar figures? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Sir Phillip  Baxter, the  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, is reported to have already discussed the Nabarlek find with representatives of the Japanese Science Technology Agency who no doubt see the Nabarlek strike as a reliable source for the massive uranium needs of Japan’s nuclear power programme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1966 confers on  Sir Phillip  Baxter, as  Chairman  of the AAEC, power to negotiate for the exploration, treatment and sale of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission under the powers conferred on it by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act could prospect for uranium itself if the Government would grant it the necessary finance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australian resources remain in the control of Australians; fourthly, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, in conjunction with the Bureau of Mineral Resources, to actively engage itself in the exploration and mining of uranium; and, fifthly, the Government to investigate and report to Parliament on the activities of the Rothchild’s backed Rio Tinto Zinc Group and its subsidiaries and its attempts to gain control of our uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It could be that the Department of External Affairs wanted to sign the Treaty - I believe it did - but its spokesman was not forceful enough and there was great pressure from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for Australia not to sign the Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no doubt that those forces within the Cabinet that have the  Sir Philip  Baxter mentality applied pressure because of their fear that they might be sold down the drain by signing the Treaty and would not get the development that they wanted; that they would not be able to create first of all their own <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapon and later their own nuclear weapon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700917_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-38-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members I present an interim report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the year ended 30th June 1970. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as cities are concerned, if there was a war 1 <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb could blow Sydney or Melbourne to pieces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nearly all research scientists in this area are in the Department of Supply, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Engergy Commission and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Despite the expenditure of over $150m on the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, Australia is still not properly prepared for the advent of nuclear technology, and is lagging behind other developed countries in its adoption. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A document which I received from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission some months ago states:  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But  Sir Phillip  Baxter,  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, could say on television that a number of sites were examined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reports to which the honourable member has referred are confidential studies by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales prepared for management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am certain that this is what the Minister and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission are doing not only to this House and to me but to scientists and the public generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have every reason to believe that after this paper was prepared - I have a copy of it in my hand together with the statement that the Minister released on 12th June for the information of the Press - it was censored and altered by a very senior official of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All that information should have been available to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, the Minister and the Government before the decision was announced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has indicated that by the turn of the century in the vicinity of $5,00On will have been spent on nuclear power stations throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, as I recollect, the Calder Hall <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power station in Cumberland in the United Kingdom was developed in 1956 and investigations went on for a long time before that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is confirmed by reference to a paper submitted to the Institute of Engineers by W. H. Roberts, Secretary for Fuel and Power in Victoria, and a former associate director of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the question of decentralisation, let me merely ask this: Did the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission or this Government investigate the concept of ‘where in this country do we need new centres of industry and population?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is it that the States of ‘ Minnesota, Vermont, Michigan and Maryland as a protection for their people have, in the light of these findings, taken unilateral action to fix dosage levels lower than that fixed by the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission will be forced to substantiate the credibility of the tolerance level and, more importantly, the people will have the opportunity to judge for themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not against Australia’s entering the field of nuclear power, but I strongly condemn the combined Government and AAEC ludicrous facade of secrecy by which the Government gags its own expertise by way of the iniquitous provisions of the Crimes Act, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the Commonwealth Public Service Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, would not this possible enrichment installation have a bearing on the tender selected for the Jervis Bay station7 Thirdly is the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission carrying out any investigations on enrichment technology? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has considered fully those aspects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are going to show the world that they can do without the advanced <span class="highlight">atomic</span> technology which is available to any country which is participating fully, by ratification, in the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I need not remind the people of Australia that the former  Senator Gorton  and the  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission are both repeatedly on record in their advocacy of these damnable weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is back 20 years in its thinking and its attitude is enshrined in the archaic <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which goes back to the early 1950s - an entirely different era when the United States and Russia were hugging to themselves the secrets of the construction of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons and also the secrets of nuclear power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another feature that is most obnoxious to the Opposition is that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is the sole buyer, builder, borrower and operator, and the Parliament is being denied access to vital information and the right to ascertain the facts associated with the final choice of a reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an obsessive secrecy on the part of the Government, and there is downright arrogance on the part of the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and of the Commission as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An example here is the paper by K. F. Adler, Commissioner and Director of Research Establishment of the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and W. J.

    <p>It goes through a number of stages including: (1) A public evaluation study by the United States AEC known as the Safety Report; (2) a report from the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards - again in public; (3) public hearings before the grant of a construction permit: and (4) the Joint Committee on <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy of the Congress is available for an overall review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the question  of  public information  it is  very interesting to consider the treatment in the United States of America of any application to build an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701015_reps_27_hor70/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Conditions set out in the tender document issued by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission provide that tenderers shall supply the initial charge of fuel and at the option of the Commission they may also be called upon to provide5 years’ supply of fuel after the commencement of commercial operation of the station. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-11">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Minister will- recall that some time ago the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission called tenders for a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has not yet been finalised but I would expect that by the end of this week I -would have the recommendation from the” Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A team of consultants is assisting the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to examine those tenders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are former employees of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission restricted., legally or otherwise, from contributing to public discussion on nuclear power stations; if so, why. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the contribution contained restricted information, as that phrase is defined in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1966, which was obtained in the course of the former employee’s employment or in any of the other circumstances sei out in section 48 of that Act, it would be an offence to make public that information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn this connection,  it should be noted that section- 53 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act makes it an offence for an employee- of the Commission to communicate information concerning activities of the Commission or the -contents of a document lo which he has had access by reason of being an employee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The information could be acquired as a result of expensive research activities, in  Australia or from <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy activities overseas in countries wilh which we have agreements for sharing nuclear knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-9">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act makes it clear that, for present purposes, the term ‘restricted information’ does not include information published in scientific or technical literature or in public statements made or authorised by or on behalf of the Commission or the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If so, was he or the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission aware of these statements when the answer to Question No.- 1271 (Hansard, 19th August 1970, page 254) was being prepared. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-18">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in its 1968-69 Annual Report indicate that overseas suppliers may not enter into contracts unless exempted from all third- party liabilities and nuclear materials may not be obtained from some countries unless such legislation has been enacted; if so, does the Government intend to take urgent action on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Such agreements are designed to prevent the diversion of nuclear materials lo military purposes and are usually administered either by the supplying country or by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency by agreement between the supplying country and the receiving country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission established in 1953 becaues of (a) the increasing demand for industrial and domestic power, (b) Australia’s then limited resources and (c) the contention that nuclear power could provide a significant economic advantage over conventional power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-45-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The European Nuclear Energy Agency and the international <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency have both predicted a steady increase in the demand for uranium which could in 10 years time slow clown because apparently there are tremendous innovations in the development of fast breeding reactors which I am told use only approximately half the fuel or energy requirements .of conventional reactors operating at the present lime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710218_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The amendment moved by the Opposition last year was a genuine attempt by the Opposition to clear up some of the doubts that existed in the minds of not only honourable members on this side of the House but also noted scientists outside the Parliament - men with reputations in the field of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> science, physics and other related matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition moved an amendment in the debate on the Estimates in order to give the Government an opportunity to examine thoroughly the economics of the introduction of nuclear power in Australia, particularly as it had been estimated by  Sir Philip  Baxter, the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, that by the year 2000 something like $5,000m would have been spent on nuclear power stations throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If a decision had been taken to proceed with the construction of the Jervis Bay nuclear power station earlier this year and the estimated expenditure had been included in this year’s Budget, I have been reliably informed that the amount required by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission would have been in the vicinity of $6m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I understand from the official sources of the papers, directly from Cabinet, that the SGHWR reactor is the one that has been recommended by the Minister for National Development  (Mr Swartz)  and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I and the Opposition want a select committee of this Parliament to be appointed in order that the questions that have been posed in the amendment that 1 have moved may be examined thoroughly and in order that all the experts from outside the Parliament and outside the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission will have an opportunity of voicing officially their opposition to the proposal and of putting information before the members of the select committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The appointment of a select committee would enable members of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to give the information that this Parliament should have at its disposal before making a decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>First, there is a public evaluation study by the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The West German Bundestag has an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>AH the reasons which the Government and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission gave for the establishment of this power station still apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the Auditor-General’s report, amongst other things, funded proportions of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s head office and research staff salaries when these officers were working on the Jervis Bay project, the purchase of premises for use by the consultants, and also expenditures incurred by the Lucas Heights research establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the sum of over $400,000 was paid for premises for use as the headquarters of the consultants, and these buildings are still owned and being used by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710819_reps_27_hor73/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said: ‘There are men in the United States who want to use <span class="highlight">atomic</span> and nuclear weapons against you’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in the course of its normal responsibilities carries out continuing surveys of current and future supply and demand for nuclear materials and in recent months senior personnel from the Commission have had discussions with several overseas countries on enriched uranium markets and the market which might be available to Australia should it become involved in this technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But all tenderers indicated that before approval to export would be given, their respective Governments would require that the nuclear power station would be subject to Safeguards administered by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency in accordance with its Statute and Procedures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710825_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-30-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that Australian Parliamentarians and the Australian public have a right to be told its purpose and the dangers, if any, to Australia of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed serious for Australia that a foreign base should be placed in our country which could bring about an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> attack on this country, and I call upon the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  immediately to give a statement to the House outlining the purpose of this facility and the impact it can have on Australia’s future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Have we not learnt to live with the idea that we are capable of completely destroying ourselves through <span class="highlight">atomic</span> warfare, although surely the threat is still there, as real, as terrifying, as hideous as it was in 1945? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710916_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Pursuant to Section 31 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953- 1966 I present the nineteenth annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for the year ended 30th June 1971 together with the financial statements and the Auditor-General’s report on those statements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for La Trobe has suggested that China has the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb and therefore it is necessary to have 12,000 extra men. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not exactly sure how 12,000 national servicemen will stop <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons from being utilised or being effective in a war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst the conscientious objector may well be prepared to say ‘yes’ to that question, that does not imply that he would also be prepared to drop an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb on  a  city which contains, amongst other people, one of those persons who allegedly may rape his wife. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710929_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are also on the fringe of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age and, here again, we as an Opposition have a very strong reason for criticising the Government, because from the very first moment when it decided to buy into nuclear power until the recent indications that it intended to opt out - and I refer to the Jervis Bay fiasco - the Government’s nuclear policy has been marked by ambiguity and secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is noteworthy that Japan in particular, which of all countries most desperately needs <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power, in its approaches to the United States has been rebuffed to this stage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has been functioning since 1952 and, in successive Budgets to 1969- 70, $130m has been spent on its capital works and programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia’s reputation in the international <span class="highlight">atomic</span> field has been tarnished through the abortive calling of tenders or the ill conceived Jervis Bay project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a body is required to probe the inefficient administration of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission which has been responsible for such monumental fiascos as the Jervis Bay <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the new authority would be to set guidelines for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> research at the Lucas Heights <span class="highlight">atomic</span> research establishment; to make recommendations on the development of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power plants; to formulate a nuclear fuel policy; to give advice about Australia’s role in the world uranium enrichment industry; and to examine the relationship of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> research to Australia’s defence requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there is very serious disillusionment with the administration of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission which, through misguided policies, has not achieved the expectations held for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will recall that this was the proposal to develop a harbour in the western part of Australia by the use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> detonation but, as I say, it was also abandoned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am in favour of Australia going into the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> era in a sensible and properly planned way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind him that at the last election a commitment was made by the Prime Minister of this country that Australia would develop an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power station at Jervis Bay, but it has now been abandoned at enormous expense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of our earlier fiascos this matter needs a lot of careful examination and, as the member for the electorate in which the Lucas Heights <span class="highlight">atomic</span> research establishment is located, I want the Committee to know that people in very high, eminent and responsible positions at the reactor are saying precisely what I have already said, and they are very anxious to ensure that the proposed uranium enrichment project is not undertaken without proper consideration, because enormous public expenditure is involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  I have said, I know personally of large numbers of dedicated people working at Lucas Heights, and I am sorry that they are disillusioned with the administration of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is more that I would like to say, but it is sufficient to say that it is my view that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission needs to come under more effective parliamentary surveillance and it ought to come under effective scientific surveillance if we are to ensure that the squandering of the taxpayers’ money that has characterised the activities of the Commission in the past is to be minimised and reduced in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable members I present the text of the Agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of Japan for Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  has tabled the text of an agreement for co-operation on the peaceful uses of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy recently concluded with Japan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a governmenttogovernment agreement somewhat similar to the other government-to-government agreements with the United States of America and Canada and agreements which our <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has effected with counterpart organisations in the United Kingdom and France. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy industry in Japan is rapidly moving towards the export of nuclear power station equipment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The safeguards called for in the agreement will be applied by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency and negotiations on the details, involving tri-lateral agreement between the Agency, Australia and Japan, are now nearing completion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As indicated by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the agreement is a framework within which separate agreements can be made to cover a wide range of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy projects and activities.It therefore creates the opportunity to develop with Japan to our mutual benefit the same close co-operation in the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy field as already exists in other areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720308_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-24-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, they have resorted to direct action thus interfering with a wide range of Commonwealth activities such as the essential services provided by the Post Office, work in defence production establishments, the naval dockyards and the operations of such bodies as the Commonwealth Railways, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Department of Works. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720309_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should mention that in formulating its monitoring programmes the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee takes note of the technical results and recommendations of a number of international organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The results of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee’s monitoring programmes are immediately made available to the National Radiation Advisory Committee for analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fresh fission products from these tests first became evident in fallout over Australia in late June 1971, some 16 days after the first explosion, and were monitored thereafter by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee to determine radiation doses to the whole body and to the thyroid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee programme of daily sampling of milk for assay of iodine 131 content in fallout from the French nuclear weapons tests, covered 9 major population centres and included the milk being consumed by about 75 per cent of the total Australian population. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee considers it is likely that the second explosion involved a high yield device with a substantial fission component. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, the monitoring programmes to which I have referred are being maintained and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee will continue to keep a close watch on the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee has assisted and cooperated with the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in a world wide programme to monitor plutonium 238 in the environment by con ducting sampling and providing materials from Australia for analysis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is disappointing that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee has not referred in its report to these developments and that the Minister has not put this material before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is no lower limit of safety for doses of radiation, then every additional <span class="highlight">atomic</span> test in the atmosphere adds to the number of deaths and deformities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, I read with some regret of the retirement of  Sir Philip  Baxter, the  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe he made a very valuable contribution to the lot of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and to the lot of science generally in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>From that University he accepted appointment as full time  chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most  of  the initiative of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission rightly can be laid at the door of  Sir Philip  Baxter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720419_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My Department and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission have been in almost constant contact with the producing companies and prospective producing companies to try to bring this about, because we believe that there can be a tremendous advantage to the Australian industry if we can have established some form of orderly marketing system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720426_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee is responsible to the Minister for Supply for safety aspects of the use of testing of nuclear explosive devices in Australia, for evaluation of proposals by other countries to explode nuclear devices outside Australia which might give rise to increased levels of radioactivity in Australia, and for monitoring of levels of radioactivity in the Australian environment arising from activities with nuclear explosive devices either in this country or elsewhere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In part of its evaluation of the hazards to health of the 1971 French tests the National Radiation Advisory Committee followed a practice adopted by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Radiation, namely, that of comparing the radiation doses from nuclear weapons tests with the doses inevitably received by the community from natural background radiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent Agreement with Japan for co-operation in the peaceful uses of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy is basically an enabling agreement under which the parties, or organisations under their jurisdiction, may make arrangements for exchanges of information and co-operative ventures in specific fields of nuclear science and technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721026_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-71-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 2 May 1973, the Prime Minister tabled Reports Nos 4 and5 of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee, together with the Report dated April 1973 of the National Radiation Advisory Committee, covering the tests in June-July 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730531_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-60-34">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members will recall that the original reason for setting up the position of executive member was that  Sir Philip  Baxter, when he first became  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, had other duties to perform notably as Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sir Philip  was then the outstanding expert in Australia on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy and he made a great contribution to our Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, while the day to day administration was carried out by  Mr Maurice  Timbs who was then the executive member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On his retirement from the University of New South Wales  Sir Philip  became full time  chairman  of the Commission and later showed the prestige with which he is regarded throughout the world by being appointed  chairman  of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency Board of Governors for 1969- 70. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now  Sir Philip  has retired from the position of  Chairman  of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and I wish to place on record my appreciation of the services of a man who devoted a great deal of time to the service of the community and the British Empire in war arid in peace and who was not only a highly competent technical officer but also an extremely able administrator. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Al) these members have made a considerable contribution to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy research and application in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>), a senior research officer of Broken Hill Pty Co.

    <p>This is certainly not in the technical field as it is undoubtedly the acknowledged technical expert in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, whilst the Commission is primarily aimed at research and advice to the Government on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, I believe that insufficient research is being undertaken in Australia in another field of energy which shows great future promise, namely, solar energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concur, of course, in the support of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Bill but I think the House should realise the importance of the potential work being done by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates not only to the peaceful use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy; it also must have some implications in the defence field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest to the honourable member for Mackellar that the purpose of the Bill is to appoint a person as  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730828_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was alleged and apparently proved to the satisfaction of the American courts that they had given <span class="highlight">atomic</span> secrets to the Soviet Union, which was about to make this development in nuclear technology in any event. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730913_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When speaking on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Bill recently I said that I thought the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission would be an excellent body to carry out research into power from the sun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We should move quickly into <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power and hydro-power but unfortunately when it comes to hydro-power we are inclined to say: What is the use of having a vast source of hydro-power such as we have in the Snowy Mountains if the unions can cut off this power at will?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that world indignation on this question was possibly brought about by that great American,  Dr Linus  Pauling, who pointed out in the first place the radioactive fall out from <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs in the form of strontium 90. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will show him the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s assessment which shows quite clearly that where the Minister said that America anticipated a shortfall of 850,000 tons of uranium by 1985, this figure is at variance with what the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission said, which set the anticipated shortfall in 1985 at 174,000 tons, not 850,000 tons as the Minister said. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission reports that in the Northern Territory where all our richest uranium deposits are, excepting Yeelirrie, the total expenditure for uranium prospecting during 1973 is expected to be $2.6 lm in 29,600 square miles held under prospecting rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, whose advice I have followed very closely throughout my period of office and which has this statutory responsibility to advise me, informs me that our reserves are to a point to justify consideration of the first stage of a centrifuge-based enrichment plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the world for perhaps the first time is being made aware of the exhaustibility of its energy resources, particularly in fossil fuels, research upon solar conversion will increase in many parts of the world and become massive in some because of the growing doubt about the viability of the large scale use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, and about pollution and the pollutive prospects of gasifying coal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731120_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are adequate powers under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which we will use for that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will be recommending to Cabinet that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should establish its own milling plant in the Northern Territory, and we will proceed on a government to government basis in respect of the sale of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The authority of our choice in the terms of the underwriting agreement will be the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, which will be operating under its existing statutory powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The forthcoming report of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission will show that we have in Australia, recoverable and reasonably recoverable, and adding the recent Pancontinental Mining Ltd discoveries, some 300,000 short tons of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740926_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To commence, let me stress one fact: By section 35 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act the title to all uranium in the Northern Territory is vested in the Commonwealth of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be operated and controlled by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, which has every possible ability to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741001_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a relatively small low grade deposit owned by Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd and the existing mill there is to be upgraded with Government financial support through the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Minister has proposed that the existing stockpile held by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission be used to meet some of the existing contracts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as I can gather, the following seems to be the situation: The Government, through the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, is to establish a mill in the Northern Territory to process uranium ore from all sources into yellowcake. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Until then, existing contracts will be met by Mary Kathleen and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The powers that we have are based on legislation introduced by the Menzies coalition Government in 1953, which with the support of the Labor Party passed the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which is still the law of the land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is the establishment of an <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to control all aspects of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy in Australia from the mining of uranium to the final disposal of the fissionable material. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 35 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act clearly states that uranium and kindred substances on land in a territory of the Commonwealth, whether alienated from the Crown or not and, if alienated, whether alienated before or after the commencement of the Act are declared to become the property of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741002_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only are there the administrative costs but also a section about which we hear little, the Division of National Mapping; the Bureau of Mineral Resources, about which we hear more and which does so much valuable work in collecting information on which decisions are made and on which the private industry has so much relied in the past; the Joint Coal Board and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741029_reps_29_hor91/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The answer to the right honourable member’s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) An exhaustive survey of all the research projects bearing on nuclear energy has not been undertaken, However, the twenty-second Annual Report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, which was tabled in Parliament on 17 October 1974, lists at pages 105 to 110: the main research programs in progress within the Commission; research contracts awarded by the Commission during the year 1973-74; and research projects carried out within Australian tertiary education institutions with support by the Australian Government through the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750603_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-49-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister inform the House whether the 72  Vi  per cent contribution by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to the development of a mill is a capital payment which will give the Commission 50 per cent equity in the project, or is it just a loan for which the Commission will obtain 50 per cent of the production? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ultimate situation, of course, is one in which the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission itself will be conducting all exploration for and mining of uranium in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that point because at various stages over the last few years Labor Party organisations have suggested that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs and so forth may be kept at this base. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750821_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It permits the export of uranium to non-parties, but requires that specific International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards apply to such exports and that such uranium be not used in nuclear explosive devices, including those for peaceful purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750826_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While there is no energy policy applicable to Australia as a whole, research in the field of energy on the contrary is placed under Commonwealth responsibility within 3 bodies- the National Coal Research Committee, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, and for petroleum research the Bureau of Mineral Resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Uranium policy was left to the Department of National Development which regarded it as purely another mining activity and nuclear policy as such was framed and pursued by the scientists of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750911_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In other words, he is backing Labor policy, which is to make sure that from now on no private exploration will be allowed in the Northern Territory and that we will deal with companies that are presently there on a profit sharing basis because title for the reserves is vested in the Commonwealth of Australia under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760219_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is the Minister going to do about the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953- which was introduced by his own coalition government and supported by the then Labor Opposition- which vested in the Commonwealth of Australia the sole ownership of uranium in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760331_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party’s view is that as all title to uranium in the Northern Territory is vested in the Commonwealth under the terms of the Menzies 1952 <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, then only a Commonwealth agency such as the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should be allowed to explore for it in the Northern Territory and any new deposits would then have the 100 per cent Australian equity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760427_reps_30_hor99/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It led to the setting up in 1953 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, after the South Australian Government and the Commonwealth had agreed to export uranium so that Australia would have the best technical expertise available to co-operate with the States and allow Australia to move, if needed,- into nuclear power generation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761006_reps_30_hor101/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Provision will be made to make it clear, where the Bill like the former Labor Government’s Bill left some doubt that the requirements of consent and agreement on terms and conditions for mining on Aboriginal land applied equally to mining undertaken under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as it does for mining carried out under the mining ordinances of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761117_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A study paper prepared by the brilliant  Mr William  Wright and  Mr John  Silver of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has stated that the immediate setting up of a uranium industry, with the aid of scientists, could result in earnings of $3,000m a year by 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-34-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has one research scientist attached to the Stanford Research Institute in the United States of America undertaking research into applications of radioisotopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761201_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-43-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The then Minister for Supply chose to infer in his answers to questions on 13 and 14 September 1972 that the nuclear wastes in question were radio active debris associated with British <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons testing in the 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Avon Hudson who worked at Maralinga during the 1960s has claimed that, in the early 1 960s, the British Government was secretly using the Maralinga <span class="highlight">atomic</span> test site as a burial ground for waste from nuclear power stations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the waste, if it were dumped then, could not have been from the debris resulting from the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> test program in the 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet these reports suggest that radio active waste was buried at least 3 years after the last <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1972, with the United States Government’s blessing obviously, the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission authorised the release of SO 000 tons of stockpiled uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Minister considered taking legislative action similar to that taken by the Canadian Government last September where it approved a regulation under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Control Act to prevent removal from Canada of information relating to this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761208_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that, during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, Australia co-operated with the British in conducting secret <span class="highlight">atomic</span> ‘trigger’ tests at Maralinga and that waste and debris from these tests were buried at Maralinga? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761209_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In 1968 the British <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Weapons Research Establishment made a report concerning material buried at Maralinga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770216_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister make experts from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation available to participate in the public debate on the mining of uranium to help fulfil the recommendation in the Fox Report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-40-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for National Resources, to whom the relevant part of the question should be directed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-40-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that, all foreign policy in fact has been <span class="highlight">atomic</span> policy, because it has been the nature and the possession of the new weapons which have determined the course of history and the way in which the greater nations could act in order to further what they thought were their own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My old friend the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  whom I respect in many ways and who has just come into this chamber, at one time suggested that Australia should use its influence to drop an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb on the People’s Republic of China. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At a minimum, where an importing country is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, then the safeguards which are applied are those under an agreement between that country and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under such safeguard arrangements for shipment and receipt of the material, arrangements are required to be reported to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, which has introduced more intensive measures of reporting and inspection of the materials when it becomes suitable for nuclear fuel and enrichment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, to the best of my knowledge, where an importing country is not a party to the non proliferation treaty arrangements, arrangements can nevertheless be made for the application of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has always had a minimal and superficial interest in waste disposal. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, such sales must be the subject of an International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards agreement, or its equivalent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770329_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These arrangements require the application of safeguards administered by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency (IAEA) to material supplied by Australia to all non-nuclear-weapon states. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has also been proposed that the Government or the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should sponsor an Australian tour by  Dr Dixie  Lee Ray, Governor of Washington State and a leading pro-nuclear figure in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770331_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Four seminars were held under the Agreement as follows: on ‘Fruit Flies’ in Honolulu from 28 November to 2 December 1976; on ‘Plant Response to Salinity ‘ at Riverside, California, from 26 to 28 April 1 976; on ‘Determination of Momentum Wave Function in <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Molecular and Nuclear Systems’ at Bloomington, Indiana, from 31 May to 4 June 1976; on ‘Electric Arc Interruption and Power Testing’ held in Sydney from 17 to 21 May 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770419_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-39-90">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thirdly, on the level of international relations, Australia must use its influence as a member of the Board of Governors of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency to ensure the extension of IAEA inspection of nuclear materials to a 24-hour, around-the-clock regime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>According to statistics compiled by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission (AAEC) there were 150 nuclear power plants operating in 19 countries at 30 June and a further 337 units were under construction or on order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On what dates, at what places and with which government officials and international organisations were discussions held on nuclear safeguards matters by the group of officers from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and National Resources and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission between 22 November and 22 December 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussions were also held with officers of the Commission of the European Communities (in Brussels, 29 November 1976, and in Luxembourg, 30 November 1976) and staff of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency (in Vienna, 2 and 3 December 1976). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, officers of the Depanment of Foreign Affairs and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission stationed in Vienna held discussions with Government officials of France (in Paris, 9 and 10 December 1976) and Italy (in Rome, 13 and 14 December 1976). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770421_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-48-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically the reasons for this decision by the corporations is that the stockpile available from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission of roughly 2000 short tonnes was not to my knowledge adequately tested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770427_reps_30_hor105/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The major interest of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in the field of waste management is concerned with wastes from mining and milling of uranium ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770504_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-30-5">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the conclusion of the recent Salzburg Conference, the most important international conference held in recent years on all aspects of nuclear power, the Director-General of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency referred to the agreement of the meeting that nuclear power was a necessary and irreplaceable source of the future energy supply to mankind for both the short and the longer term. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The major systems of international safeguards are administered by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to keep policy under review; careful selection of eligible customers for uranium; the application of effective International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards; bilateral agreements with customer countries; fallback safeguards; prior Australian Government consent in relation to re-export, enrichment and reprocessing; physical security; safeguards provisions in contracts; and international and multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is aware that work has recently been under way within the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency on a new system of equally stringent safeguards to cover the entire nuclear industry in non-nuclear weapon states which are not parties to the NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will therefore export only to nuclear weapon states which give Australia this assurance and accept that the uranium we supply be covered by International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the Government wishes to ensure that if a decision is taken to permit new uranium export, the uranium will be covered by International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards from the time it leaves Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, it will be the Government’s policy that any future sales arrangements for exports of Australian uranium should be such that the uranium will be in a form which attracts full International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamental undertakings the Government will wish to obtain from uranium importing countries in such bilateral agreements are that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already made clear that Australia would not be prepared to export uranium to such countries in the absence of International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards applied under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Government feels it is reasonable to ask importing countries who will already accept International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards of comprehensive scope under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to accept that, at the first fallback level also, international safeguards should apply to all nuclear material not just that portion supplied by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, we believe the agreements should specify compliance with standards of physical security based, at a minimum, on International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency recommendations as presently defined and as updated from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will also continue to attach major importance to the effective application of safeguards by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy has been the subject of detailed exchanges of views with other countries- both uranium importers and major nuclear exporters- and relevant international organisations including the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take just one specific component of the Government’s safeguard policy to illustrate how poorly thought out these safeguards are, apart from the implied reliance upon the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards, which the Fox Commission said were next to useless and which the Opposition has referred to constantly in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister says that the Government will insist upon agreements with such countries containing clauses ensuring that nuclear materials supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from it will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and, further, that International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770524_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In rubbishing the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards, the honourable member has said that there is an implied reliance in the Government’s policy on IAEA safeguards which, he claims, the Fox Inquiry said were next to useless. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All I am saying is that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency is an imperfect instrument in a very imperfect nuclear world and that the basis of the Government’s safeguards policy is too reliant upon the IAEA system of safeguards which is clearly inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has made new discoveries in the Alligator River area, not proved as to their magnitude but indicating that under that plain there are numbers of Nabarleks, Rangers and Pancontinentals still to be discovered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commission feels this threat, despite the extensive precautions taken under the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards system, to an appropriate commentary on those 2 systems, one can only note  President  Carter’s recent actions which tends to suggest that those 2 agreements probably are nowhere near as safe as we believed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>India is not and was not then a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the safeguards that applied to India at the time were rudimentary and did not exclude the so-called peaceful nuclear explosion; nor did the agreement with Canada apply International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the Nixon administration in 1973 to allow private enterprise to take over from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission meant that in 1974, when the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission announced it was to cease selling uranium, it artifically forced prices to skyrocket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Atomic</span> weapons are becoming the growing concern of more and more people as they learn about and interest themselves in the mining of uranium and the purposes for which some countries may ultimately use the uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He pointed out in one of his lectures that some 10 000 young people between the ages of 7 and 12 years had died in the United States of leukaemia and that it was believed that these deaths had been brought about by the testing of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons in the atmosphere by the United States before it was agreed- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have often wondered whether that was the result of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing that occurred in the atmosphere some years ago before the great powers agreed to the outlawing of such testing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, on the question of waste, a committee of my Party in this Parliament recently had before it  Dr Hardy  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, who was said to be a pro-uranium man very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as a source of power, and I believe he is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, we would be the garbage dump for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These submissions were put before us by a very eminent <span class="highlight">atomic</span> scientist in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yes, in geologically sound areas, and it should then be guarded for 1000 years to ensure that it could not be obtained for purposes of manufacturing <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 ) The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has carried out since 1959 a comprehensive program of monitoring the levels of radioactivity in the Woronora River, in biological materials associated with it, and on beach and bottom sands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This work was summarised for the decade 1 960- 1969, and the significance of the results assessed, in a paper presented to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Uses of <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy in Geneva in 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770602_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-33-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government is satisfied that the specification of standards of physical security by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency constitutes the basis upon which national governments can provide strong protection against nuclear terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Memorandum of Understanding provides for the Commonwealth, through the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, to engage in a joint venture with Peko/EZ for the mining of uranium at Ranger, beginning with the establishment of a mine of  3,300  short tons capacity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s decision to retain the Memorandum of Understanding will mean that the Ranger Project will therefore be developed under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as envisaged by the Whitlam Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry recommended against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act on the grounds that this legislation was enacted largely with defence considerations in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having reviewed this matter the Government nevertheless considered that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act provides an appropriate basis for mining operations at Ranger in accordance with the agreements concluded between the companies and the Commonwealth in 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In coming to this conclusion, the Government had regard to the view of the Ranger Inquiry that its concern over the appropriateness of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act would have less force if the Uranium Advisory Council recommendation of the Inquiry were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In particular, the working panel which proposed it drew on a code of practice prepared by the International Labour Organisation and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It took account of recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and discussions in expert panels convened by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It studied papers presented to, and discussions at, an International Symposium on Radiation Protection in Mining and Milling of Uranium and Thorium arranged by the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The working panel was aware that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency has in preparation a manual, with explanatory guidelines, on the management of radioactively contaminated wastes and effluents arising in the mining and milling of radioactive ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An integral part of the improvement in the safeguards regime that I called for in March was that Australia should join with others in obtaining agreement for around-the-clock International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency inspections of materials, subject to Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, the Director-General of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency reported in June this year that there were deficiencies in member states’ safeguards systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards are the most advanced safeguards in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I have been  to the  Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and have spoken to some of our experts there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency agreements a signatory country can withdraw on six months notice to the parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs said today that the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency agreements were the first and second cornerstones of government policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister went on to talk about bilateral agreements which, as I interpret what he said, are very much a restatement of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently I had the opportunity to visit the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy plant at Lucas Heights in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770825_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professor Kerr could have added another one which relates to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, to which I will refer later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The policy contained four so-called safeguards- firstly, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; secondly, the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards; thirdly, bilateral agreements; and, fourthly, participation in multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to refer finally and quickly to the fact that the Government also committed a major breach of the Fox Commission recommendations when it decided to base uranium mining on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to believe other than that the Government decided to base uranium mining on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act because of the measures that this would give to it to enable it to take action against unions and people who might be trying to obstruct uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the many repressive aspects of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is that all works carried out by or on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission are as if those works were approved defence projects within the meaning of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, in terms of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act itself, there are many penalties provided against workers involved in uranium mining if they take any action such as a strike. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first major contradiction was disclosed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition (  Mr Uren)  yesterday when he showed that the Government was using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the associated Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947-73 in relation to uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We distinguish between the peaceful and non-peaceful uses of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We, therefore, support the mining of uranium providing this is done under strict, supervised controls and in accordance with the safety and health regulations applied by the World Health Organisation and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is satisfied that the standards of physical security by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency constitute the basis upon which national governments can provide strong protection against nuclear terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for National Resources  (Mr Anthony)  said in the course of this debate that the Government was basing its authority on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view there is no basis within the present constitutional framework for the Government to rely on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to quote what the Fox Commission said when dealing with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An alternative for Ranger left open by the Land Rights Act is an authority to mine under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1 953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is related to defence and the defence power is where it can be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least the Government might encourage that to be done and not suggest that everything is in order because it can use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Some 32 years ago the world was horrified to see the unleashing of the greatest force that man had ever known; that was the explosion of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are certainly more significant, but must be seen in parallel with those of both the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The areas which are being covered by the Australian Government in terms of safeguards are the need to keep policy under constant review, a careful selection of eligible customers for uranium, the application of effective international <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy safeguards, bilateral agreements with customer countries, fall-back safeguards, prior Australian Government consent in relation to reexport, enrichment and reprocessing, constant physical security, safeguard provisions in contracts and international multi-lateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw them from a report entitled ‘Uranium Resources and Requirements’ published by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and written by Messrs Silver and Wright. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has suggested the application of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The annual report of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission for 1973-74 states that reasonably assured resources in Australia are presently estimated at 188,000 tonnes uranium forming a significant part of total estimated world resources . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770906_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I note that the proposed board of Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd was to consist of four directors, two to be appointed by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and one each to be appointed from Peko and EZ Industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, the Government’s safeguards policy is an eleven-point program which requires: Continual review and improvement of international safeguards standards; the considered selection of customer countries according to strict and comprehensive criteria of eligibility; the application of International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards; the prior conclusion of bilateral agreements to ensure that nuclear material supplied by Australia is used for peaceful and non-explosive purposes; the provision of fall-back safeguards to cover the possibility of IAEA safeguards at some time ceasing to apply in a customer country; prior Australian consent to re-export; prior Australian consent to enrichment of Australian uranium beyond 20 per cent uranium 235; Prior Australian consent to reprocessing; adequate physical protection of the nuclear industries in customer countries; the inclusion of safeguards implementation provisions in commercial contracts; and Australian contribution to constructive multilateral efforts to strengthen safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrary to the advice of the Inquiry, the whole issue was then brought within the scope of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947-1973 and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1956. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It then whipped out the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953-1956, which just happened to contain a clause which suited it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So if the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission carries out any works they will be, by definition, approved defence projects and will carry with them the penalties previously mentioned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He said that Australia had done all it could to see that other countries adhered to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why I passionately believe in the Labor Party’s policy that a moratorium of at least two years should be maintained until the world can overcome the unknown, unsolved problems regarding the successful disposal of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for St George pointed out that there are in operation pilot schemes which have been successful in the disposal of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then under the supervision of the new Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission subsidiaries of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd at Rum Jungle and Mary Kathleen and smaller companies in other places quickly began mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act makes provision to gaol anyone who impedes its production and export. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, residues were left behind which, according to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission estimates, will continue to pollute the local environment at Rum Jungle over an area of 100 square kilometres for at least 100 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>An examination of that would reveal that there is no change in the incidence of leukaemia whether or not <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests are being carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a previous debate in this House, during the last session of parliament, I referred to a proposal put forward by an officer of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox reports refer to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and state that it cannot be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The FDP main federal committee decided several weeks ago that building permission for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power stations should be refused until permission had been granted for the first stage of building for an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste re-processing plant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was a great debate in the United States as to whether the military or civilians ought to be in charge of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770907_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It goes beyond it in these respects: The customer non-nuclear weapon states must be parties to the nonproliferation treaty involving International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards and accept our additional safeguards requirements under the bilateral treaties which they must enter into with us; existing nuclear weapon states must agree that Australian uranium will not be used for military purposes and be covered by IAEA safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770908_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A report produced by the Canadian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission stated quite clearly that the risk of 1,000 people being killed by an accident with a nuclear reactor is about one-ten thousandth of the risk of that number of people being killed as a result of the failure of a dam or a reservoir. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real issue facing the world today is the energy crisis and this is what the world should be tackling so that collectively we can overcome this crisis other than by the use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy which will pollute this world for the next 250,000 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliamentary Labor Party’s environmental committee had a representative of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission address it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770914_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency has expressed a view on that matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to come to that fairly shortly because the view that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency has expressed is not dissimilar to the position which has been taken by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the Salzburg conference  Dr Eklund,  the Director-General of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency had this to say: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Today the advice of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was sought on whether the view of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency expressed at Salzburg had in any sense been varied. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite plainly, the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency has said that they are known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770920_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency does believe that technology exists for the proper disposal of wastes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a report by Des Power from London in an  AM  broadcast this morning, the transcript of which is headed ‘International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy authority spokesman says technology exists for safe nuclear waste disposal’, the following question was asked: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you think the Australian Prime Minister is right then in claiming that there are sufficient methods of disposal of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that at the end of it the spokesman for the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency made a point when he was asked: Is it proven? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quite clearly the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency does not believe that the development of nuclear power for peaceful purposes should be held up while further work is done in relation to the matter of waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Leader of the Opposition meant what he said on the television program  Monday Conference  he would take the word of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he agree with the evidence given on behalf of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to Senate Estimates Committee A last week that the disposal of nuclear waste by processing on an industrial basis has not been economic to date and that the actual carrying out of disposal on a commercial basis has not been attempted because it has not been economic and is not economic even today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has he noted the evidence given on the same occasion in answer to questions by one of his own followers that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is not now sufficiently well represented overseas to keep in touch with developments around the world and has expressed great concern about its staff levels whicn have been imposed by his Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In respect of that evidence what steps have been taken to restore the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s representation overses to an adequate basis? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The honourable gentleman can be assured that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission maintains very close liaison on the matters under discussion by the House and is as well informed as it is possible to be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that would demonstrate very clearly the statements of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission that the technology does exist, that it is applied, and that it has operated on a trial basis but on a very large trial basis indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that the point being made by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is well known: There has not been a move from the trial plants to commercial plants before this time because the amount of waste to be disposed of in this way had not required it- and there is no other reason than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I quote from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission ‘s journal of July 1976. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox report and the information from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission do not seem to support the Opposition’s call for a suspension of the reintroduction of mining and export of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The establishment of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was on the way when the Chifley Government was defeated in 1948. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The reports to which the honourable member has referred are confidential studies by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales prepared for management. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>You are trying to scare the Australian nation into believing that it is unsafe to use simple <span class="highlight">atomic</span> or nuclear reactors for energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>You do not even know that the Soviet Union at this moment is building one of the most powerful <span class="highlight">atomic</span> breeder reactors ever seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is turning out simple reactors for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, like  Mr Ford  turned out motor cars. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Labour government in Britain secretly, without even telling its own organisation, authorised the explosion of the first British <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thank goodness the British Labour Party had the good, sound sense to understand that following the explosion of the first British <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb there would be a peaceful use for uranium and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could  Mr Hawke,  with all his stupidity, really believe that in today’s world the Labor Party would say that it would deny <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy or the uranium of our country to the underdeveloped nations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Fancy the Australian unions being the only unions in the world that are against the exporting of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite pretend that we do not know that Australia was involved in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy protection arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1956 Australia was one of the first governors of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span>  energy  board which was designated as the body to regulate all <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy operations in this part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am stunned to think that no member of the Opposition has said with pride that in the early days of 1956 we were members of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy board in Europe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now they talk about <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The say that we do not know how to cope with <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, if we export uranium are we certain that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency can police it? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, is there a technology which can deal with <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste when it comes out of all the ordinary reactors around the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been no injury from <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My conviction is that the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency itself is not satisfied with the standards which have been set down. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on this occasion in this debate I think it is fair enough to point out that everything that he said about the development of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, about the speeches of the late Rt  Hon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subsequent to the explosion of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb in South Australia, people from the South Australian Government set out to discover whether any ill effects could be detected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770922_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the series had been concluded, the areas involved were cleaned up in 1967 by the British to comply with standards set by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee (AWTSC) - an Australian body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771005_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-41-9">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one wants to take at face value the remarks of the Opposition, one can only conclude that it regards the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards as static as well as ineffective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report also states that  Mr Justice  Fox said there was concern about the ability of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency to administer the safeguards satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771103_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has accepted the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to control uranium mining in the Alligator River area and the Kakadu national park area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger report argued very strongly against using the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, both for environmental reasons and reasons associated with civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The operation of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act allows no other consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act also overrides the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But because authority has been granted to Ranger under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act the ‘mining interest’ provisions of the Land Rights Act do not apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In respect of how many of those facilities in each country has a subsidiary agreement been made providing for the attachment of safeguards to those facilities under the Safeguards Agreement between Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the European <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Community and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-85">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>European Communities Information Research and Development pamphlet 9/77 states that in 1976 there were the following numbers of nuclear installations in the civil nuclear industries of the nine member States of the European <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Community (EURATOM): 35 preparation and frabrication plants  71 power reactors 117 research reactors 13 reprocessing plants  211 research centres, laboratories, stores, enrichment plants and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-85">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subsidiary arrangements, including facility attachments, to be concluded under the Safeguards Agreement, define the technical procedures for the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency (IAEA) to implement its safeguards on a permanent basis in the seven non-nuclear-weapon States of the European <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-85">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pending finalisation of the subsidiary arrangements, the IAEA is applying safeguards to nuclear facilities in the seven non-nuclear-weapon States of the European <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Community by means of ad hoc safeguards inspections under the terms of the Safeguards Agreement <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-85">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said on 22 July, the Government wants to see early resolution of the subsidiary arrangements between the European <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Community authorities, the national Governments of the seven non-nuclear-weapon States that are members of the Community and the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771108_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-45-85">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just last month two scientists from the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Research Establishment,  Dr Feates  and  Dr Keen,  wrote: ‘Ten years of research will be needed before we have enough information on any specific site to propose a pilot-scale trial of a disposal system’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>These include, of course, the application of International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards of indefinite duration and cover all peaceful nuclear activities in nonnuclear weapon states, the prohibition of nuclear explosive uses, the maintenance of adequate physical security, and United States consent to re-transfer, et cetera. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780315_reps_31_hor108/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members will be pleased to know that under the direction of  Mr Robert  Fry, who has been seconded from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development to undertake preliminary functions of the proposed Supervising Scientist, steps have already been taken to establish monitoring of base-line environmental conditions in the region. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 as part of a package of legislation giving effect to the Government’s decision on the further development of Australia’s uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments to the Act contained in this Bill will enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to participate on behalf of the Commonwealth in a joint venture with Peko-EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, which used the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as its legislative basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The opportunity is also being taken to strengthen and clarify the legislative basis for the application of nuclear safeguards within Australia in accordance with the agreement between the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency and Australia in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a consequence, the present Government did not accept the recommendation of the Ranger Inquiry that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act not be used for the grant of authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger Inquiry recommended against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act on the grounds that this legislation was enacted largely with defence considerations in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After reviewing this matter, the Government nevertheless considered that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act could provide an appropriate basis for mining operations at Ranger, in accordance with the agreements concluded between the companies and the Whitlam Government in 1974 and 1975. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  indicated in his statement of 25 August 1977 that in reaching this decision the Government had regard to the view of the Ranger Inquiry that its concern over the appropriateness of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act would have less force if the Uranium Advisory Council recommendation of the Inquiry were adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly, we are proposing amendments to sections 17 and 34 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which will substantially broaden the basis of the Act and clearly authorise the participation of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only will the amendments we are proposing provide a clear legal basis on which the Ranger project can be authorised to proceed, but they will also remove the main obstacle that the Ranger Inquiry saw in proceeding with the Ranger project under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By ratifying this most important international instrument, Australia undertook, amongst other things, not to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and to accept safeguards applied by the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency covering all nuclear material in all peaceful nuclear activities within Australia, under our jurisdiction or carried out anywhere under our control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislative base for the control of nuclear materials in Australia is Part III of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953, headed ‘Control of Materials’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The national system of accounting for and control of materials was, therefore, established under the Minister responsible for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The body involved, the Australian Safeguards Office, answers directly to the Minister through the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present, all nuclear material which is required to be inspected by the IAEA is located within the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary, however, for regulations to be in place to ensure this compliance as the inventory of material for which safeguards are required increases and spreads beyond the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and government ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 34 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act at present provides that the powers conferred in relation to the control of materials shall be exercised only: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clauses 4, 6 and 7 of the Bill update provisions of the principal Act relating to staff and officials of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to bring them into line with current drafting practice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, section 31 (2) (b) of the principal Act is to be amended to meet the request of the Auditor-General that he no longer be required to report on the ‘state of affairs’ of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, it is proposed that section 61 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act be deleted as it is no longer required in view of recent amendments to the Judiciary Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have established a national system of accounting for and controlling nuclear material as required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty and by our safeguards agreement with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The domestic legislative base for giving effect to these obligations has been the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, and will continue to be that Act as amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in its latest annual report says that the demand for uranium will be down by 36 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has forecast a drop of 36 per cent in world demand for Australian uranium because of delays and revisions to nuclear power programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing contract agreed to by the previous Labor Government and conservative governments prior to 1972 accounts for about 11,700 short tons of uranium, of which only approximately 2,500 tons cannot be met by the Mary Kathleen mine or by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s stockpiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780410_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also supported the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency proposal for a convention requiring States to take strong action against any crime including terrorist activity, involving nuclear materials or facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780411_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-37-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1 953 <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780502_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-16">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iran has a safeguards agreement with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency covering all of its nuclear activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That organisation is the successor to the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that we will sell only to countries which have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which have accepted the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards procedures and with whom we have reached a bilateral agreement and that the present nuclear nations will be required not to use Australian uranium to manufacture weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point I make is this: A lot has been said tonight about why the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is being used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to make it clear again for the record that the Australian Safeguards Office works absolutely independently of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that the Office reports to the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, but to me through the  Chairman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work being done now internationally by the Australian Safeguards Office through the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency in Vienna on the application of safeguards is effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition put the case that in 1974 it tried under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to introduce regulations that were argued and defeated in the Senate, and that somehow that is inconsistent with the Government’s decision now to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to let the Ranger operation proceed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the Bill will allow for proper safeguards, and the safeguards we have entered into internationally with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, and any bilateral agreements we may have, to be implemented in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The introduction of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978 demonstrates in the clearest possible way that the Government has failed to take seriously the criticisms of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry of the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as a vehicle for the commercial development of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has failed to separate the contradictory roles assigned to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission with respect to nuclear safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has failed to remove the repressive intimidatory security measures of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which will now be applicable also to commercial uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, in February of this year the  Chairman  of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission wrote:  the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency Special Safeguards Implementation Report indicated that a country’s agreement to subject its nuclear activities to IAEA safeguards does not necessarily assure that adequate material control and accounting measures are applied in all cases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose it not only because it would provide a right to mine, but also because the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is a totally inappropriate Act to control commercial or civil uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose it because the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is an inappropriate body to be responsible for civil uranium development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1 953 not be used for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having reviewed this matter, the Government neverthess considered that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act provides an appropriate basis for mining operations at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report is now public, and it demonstrates that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is an unacceptable basis for uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was designed to enable the Australian Government, via the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, to control the exploitation of uranium in the Territories and throughout the Commonwealth for defence purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In proposed new section 38 of Part HI of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act regulations can be used to control the mining, treatment, use and disposal of uranium under licences issued by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a power additional to the general power of the Minister to direct the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to undertake and supervise operations involving uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The harsh, repressive measures of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act- measures which the Bill before the House does not seek to eliminate- are completely unjustified to cover commercial uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does the present Government want to continue to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only reason the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was proposed by the Labor Government to apply to the possible Ranger project was that the preferred alternative, the more appropriate alternative, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority, was invalidated by the High Court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not only was the Labor Government’s attempt to establish the Petroleum and Minerals Authority sabotaged by what is now the Government, but in 1974 when, as a substitute for the PMA, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy sought to use regulations made under section 38 ( 1 ) of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to licence uranium mining, these regulations were disallowed by the Senate Opposition majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the same people who now occupy the Government benches in the Senate and who will be expected to support this Bill, in 1974 condemned and vetoed the use of provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 10 of the Bill would amend section 38 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to extend and strengthen the Minister’s power to regulate and control the rnining, processing, possession, transportation, use and disposal of uranium and related and associated minerals or other substances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Senate left the Minister no alternative to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission acting under the direction of the Minister as provided under section 19 to control the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect was that because the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission became the agent of the Government in the Ranger venture, the full security provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, including powers under the approved Defence Projects Protection Act, came to apply to any exploitation of Ranger uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The objections of the Fox Inquiry to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act arose from three considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, there could be a real or apparent conflict of interest between the entrepreneurial role of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and its responsibilities under the Act to supervise local environmental protection measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment, however, there are only shaky grounds to suggest that an independent Council will be able to offset the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act’s potential for preventing adequate public scrutiny of the environmental standards at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed the appointment of an <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission scientist to set up the office of supervising scientist responsible for environmental research and monitoring hardly inspires confidence in the Government’s sensitivity to the need for unimpeachable information and judgments on environmental controls. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The body this Government proposes to be responsible for these obligations, the Australian Safeguards Office, will report through the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same body, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission would be regulating and commercially promoting uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most objectionable aspect of the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as a basis for the Government’s uranium mining proposals is the frightening powers the Act gives the Government by virtue of its security provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should unions opposed to the establishment of a mine at Ranger not be deterred by the possible use of these powers, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act itself allows that a person authorised by the Minister may enter a mine site, as stated in section 41, ‘with such workmen and other persons as he thinks fit. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act could be invoked against workers taking part in normal industrial disputes over wages, working conditions and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the associated Approved Defence Projects Protection Act could be used in a heavy-handed attempt by the Government to repress the opposition to uranium mining and to stifle public discussion of the hazards, dangers and unresolved problems of the nuclear industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as it now stands and as it would be amended by the Bill before the House is entirely irrelevant to the mining of uranium in Australia at this time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the only reason the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is involved in the proposed Ranger venture is that the Senate under Liberal-Country Party control in 1974 rejected the more satisfactory direct regulation of uranium development by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1974, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission were at best a third choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just last week on 24 April, speaking on Australian Broadcasting Commission radio, Professor Charles Kerr described the Ranger inquiry’s attitude to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is under no obligation to pursue the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, even if it does choose to continue with the 1975 Memorandum of Understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It chooses to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to cover uranium mining in the civil sense. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has failed, in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act Amendment Bill, to propose any amendments to the Act which could even at the most generous estimate eliminate the worst excesses of the security provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has failed to take the opportunity available to review the Act thoroughly, to evaluate the terms under which the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission undertakes its research and commercial activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are serious matters that the present Government has chosen not to give attention to in proposing amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it substantially widens the functions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission as an inappropriate body to be responsible for uranium development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regard the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as an inappropriate Act to control the civilian use of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next thing we will have is the spokesman for the Opposition seeking to deny that under the agreement the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is vitally involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under that Memorandum of Understanding the Labor Government involved the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to the extent of 7214 per cent, Peko 13% per cent and EZ 13% per cent of the total investment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has said that he is not altogether happy with the way in which we are going ahead with this matter; we do not really agree with that Memorandum of Understanding, with the way it was set up or with the involvement of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill which amends the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is a vital part of that package. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel that if we were to vary in any substantial way the proposals contained in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, we would be moving away from those safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note the way in which Australia, under the safeguards provisions, will seek and ensure the implementation of the requirements of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency for the control of uranium and the by-products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to bring to the attention of the House the closing remarks made by Sigvard Eklund, the Director-General of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, at the International Conference on Nuclear Power and its Dual Cycle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Director-General of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, an international body contributed to by those people who seek to stretch their capacity for the use of energy, is saying that he feels that he has not been successful in explaining to the world some of the implications and the importance of alternative energy forms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A major conversion to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power has long been the principle of Comecon energy policy which will not be hampered by ecology minded minority pressure groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting up of the Uranium Advisory Council, the provisions that will come forward for environmental protection, the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, the amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Act, the amendments to the Northern <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We reject as specious the Government’s justifications for its policy, and we condemn as ill-considered and dangerous its decision to control and regulate uranium mining with an amended <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The optimistic nuclear estimates of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, produced in its latest annual report, are one-sixth down on the estimates it made for the Ranger inquiry, only a year earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I begin by reminding the House that the Ranger inquiry recommended against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to regulate and control the Ranger operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, the Government plans not only to continue with the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission as a partner in the Ranger venture, but also to strengthen the role of the Commission in the development and administration of nuclear safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be he who receives the reports of the Safeguards Office, via the  Chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two functions were separated in the United States three years ago, with the division of the United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission into the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have already pointed out, in general terms, that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should not be used for a commercial project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Government has retained the terms of the Memorandum, including specifically the quite unsuitable control provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act; and it has widened the areas in which regulations involving security can be made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I can hardly believe that the amendments proposed in this Bill to sections 34 and 38 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act come from the same people who in opposition, only four years ago, sought to destroy the Whitlam Government’s initiatives which would have enabled Commonwealth control over mineral developments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do this at the moment essentially requires an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb explosion in order to produce enough temperature and pressure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I join with my colleagues in opposing at all stages this obnoxious <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that fails it will stand ready with the full repressive force of the police state tactics enshrined in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which the Bill now before the House seeks to amend, to suppress openly opposition to the uranium go-ahead. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear to  President  Marcos, to his <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and to the Westinghouse Corporation that they should not count on Australian uranium to fuel their reactors or to fuel their other ambitions over the 30-year life of a nuclear power facility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision of the Fraser Government to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to cover uranium mining at Ranger, against the strong recommendations of the Fox inquiry, is a very ominous decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members have not already read italthough anybody who reads  Hansard  or the newspapers should be aware of its contents- I refer them to pages 248 to 252 of the second Fox report The amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act now before the House compound the concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government continues to say that it is using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act only because the Labor Government used it in the Memorandum of Understanding signed in October 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, if the Ranger inquiry says that it is inappropriate and even dangerous for a government to invoke the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to cover a commercial venture, that Act should not be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labor’s reference to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act in the 1974 Memorandum is irrelevant in the present circumstances, just as are so many of the twisted arguments that this Government uses to cover its pro-uranium policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did the Fraser Government decide to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members well know uranium was being mined at Rum Jungle under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and at that time the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was exporting uranium both to Britain and the United States to be used in the production of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly the Government recognises that this repressive <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act will be extremely useful if it fails to neutralise public opposition in general and trade union opposition in particular. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By conducting uranium mining under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act the Government has the power to deny ordinary industrial rights to workers and unions associated with the mining, handling and transportation of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to cover uranium mining makes an outlaw of any worker, union or Australian citizen who does not fully comply with the uranium mining and export policies of the Fraser Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the many repressive aspects of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is that ‘all works carried out by or on behalf of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’ including uranium mining at Ranger- are viewed ‘as if those works were approved defence projects within the meaning of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This aspect of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is all- embracing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government now is proposing, as we are opposing, provisions that will consolidate the extent of the power of the Government under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It wants to make a mockery of the regulations of the uranium industry by putting the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in charge of the regulation of uranium mining while at the same time it is clearly very active in promoting things nuclear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Now we are participating in a fourth debate on uranium this time on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main purpose of the Bill that we are debating is to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments to the Act contained in the Bill, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding which used the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as its legislative basis, will enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission on behalf of the Commonwealth to participate in a joint venture with Peko EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether we like it or not, we are in the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am amazed at the violent opposition from the members of the Opposition in this House, particularly in view of the support given by the Labour Government in Great Britain to the extension of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy for power purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned earlier, whether we like it or not we are living in an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste is stored throughout the world it is monitored by a worldwide body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have had people tell me that 30 or 40 Indians in some part of the United States of America developed cancer as the result of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor being sited nearby. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age; let us act like responsible people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition opposes the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill for the simple reason that it is an inappropriate measure in many aspects, particularly from the legal point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We strongly recommend against the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for the grant of authority to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has noted that  Mr Justice  Fox was critical of the proposal in 1975 to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as the appropriate base for any activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is because the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act- the Act which this Bill seeks to amend- is based on the defence power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s response is to extend the constitutional base of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to trade and commerce and to external affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is 25 years old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The application of science and technology, including <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy, could bring to Australia prosperity and fruitfulness such as few nations have experienced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The adoption of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act by Australia coincided with a significant shift in international approaches to the control of nuclear industry and the avoidance of nuclear proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposal was not adopted and instead the United States sought to achieve control by monopoly of nuclear secrets, by terminating all nuclear co-operation with other countries and by government monopoly of domestic <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency was established and a policy of international co-operation adopted so that by cooperation, rather than by monopoly, nuclear industry could be controlled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was established in this environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We find them together in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission had the kind of variety of powers we find now so badly proposed by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No longer does one branch of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency approve the safety of projects of another branch. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is totally undesirable for any amendment of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to be brought in here with the defence power only remaining as its basis, just as it is inappropriate for the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to remain its own watchdog. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was established it was given responsibility for all fields of nuclear energy and for cooperation with the States in the discovery and mining of uranium ores. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Howard Beale, in a speech in 1953, said that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission would concern itself with ‘uranium and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy for industrial as well as defence purposes’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia will make increasing use of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power in the years ahead and thetime for this nation to enter the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age has now arrived. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy one of the most interesting aspects of my portfolio, despite my complete ignorance of the technology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My purpose in setting this out is to indicate clearly that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has a history of blind-alley research and dedication to nuclear energy options without regard for reality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AAEC was established, and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act drafted at a time when it was thought that we were entering the age of the atom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be more appropriate to extract certain functions from the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and to establish two new bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.  Mr LIONEL  BO WEN -Before the sitting was suspended, I was submitting that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was the wrong Act to be used in the present circumstances, and again I remind the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I made the point that we need new bodies, and I mentioned a uranium development authority and said that its functions ought to include those in Section 17(1 )(A) to (D) in the present <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, with the deletion of any reference to encouragement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to note that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States and the proposed <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Safety Commission in Japan reflect some of the considerations to be taken into account- at present Japan is in the process of splitting the functions into two on the basis of being able to get the safeguards required- bearing in mind the large differences between the activities in those countries and in Australia requiring regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dealing with research and production, the remaining function of the current <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission- that is, research and production of isotope material- could be put to further study in the context of an overall energy research policy and arrangements could be made for the supply of isotopes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I offer these thoughts to demonstrate the directions in which there could be a rational up-dating of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have here is a broadening of the old <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, a piece of Menzies Cold War legislation being updated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rise tonight in support of the Government and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1978, and refer to the beginning of the second reading speech in which the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  stated: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 as part of a package of legislation giving effect to the Government’s decision on the further development of Australia’s uranium resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amendments to the Act contained in this Bill will enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to participate on behalf of the Commonwealth in a joint venture with Peko-EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, which used the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as its legislative basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the kind of man we will have to cope with in the future, not someone armed with an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ANU asked for only $4m, yet we can give tens of millions to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> research at Lucas Heights which, as previous Opposition speakers have indicated, in many cases is outdated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government cannot expect that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act of a former generation- when <span class="highlight">atomic</span> potential was seen outstandingly as a feature of the Cold War- should be equally relevant to the energy crisis of 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely today there are some glimmerings of hope of an alternative to World War III, which did not seem terribly likely at the time of the formulation of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission (AAEC) supplies technetium-99m pertechnatate in the ready-to-use form as well as in the form of devices called generators, from which it can be obtained by users. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780503_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The view of the Australian Labor Party on uranium mining is well known and has been covered fully by previous speakers in the debate concerning the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not concern itself with nuclear safeguards, which should be governed by our Safeguards Agreement with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, and by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In previous correspondence the South Australian Government has pointed out a number of areas particularly in the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill and the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of little wonder that the State governments are denouncing this package of legislation, particularly the amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act grabs overall power over this unfortunate area of uranium mining - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If honourable members referred to the debate that took place last night on the Bill to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, they would recognise that the Opposition failed to see that part of the obligations placed on the Australian Government are within the ambit of international controls of these commodities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, for example, within New South Wales we have a stockpile of yellowcake at the Lucas Heights establishment which is operated by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is very depressing because the Soviet Union is one of the largest producers of uranium and one of the largest manufacturers of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy plants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at what happened last evening to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission Bill we see that no State rights are left under that legislation- the Commonwealth has the power to go in and mine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us make this point: In the debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, which was passed last evening and gave the Commonwealth absolute powers to control uranium mining irrrespective of any State legislation, we stressed again the importance of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would be a major reason why the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was used as the Government’s first line of attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly there are grounds for having more than ordinary secrecy in legislation relating to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy passed in the shadow of a nuclear war or even a cold war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780504_reps_31_hor109/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, it would take an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion or a major earthquake to cause leakage and both of these would break the dam wall itself thus releasing all the water anyway. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780508_reps_31_hor109/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I must say at the outset of what will have to be a succinct answer to a series of questions dealing with an intricate matter that we do not start from the assumption that countries will seek to breach their important treaty obligations to us or to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency, or under the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780509_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I direct my question to the Minister for Trade and Resources and I refer him to submissions by the Philippines <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency that since the Philippines is in a volcanic belt and has no stable salt rock formations, the long-term storage and disposal of its nuclear waste will depend on the establishment of an international burial site. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All honourable members know that the role of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, since its inception, has been to encourage the development of uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation is that the Supervising Scientist was an employee of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A strong body of evidence demonstrates a widespread lack of confidence in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission as the final arbiter of standards for the proposed mining operations, and as monitor of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In my view, the Minister is perfectly correct: It has nothing to do with the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780529_reps_31_hor109/#debate-11">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, there is the assault upon civil liberties, and secondly, we are utterly and completely opposed to uranium mining at this stage because there is no known way to dispose of nuclear waste, and because the safeguards- such as the international <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy agency safeguards that the Government is depending upon, and also bilateral agreements and signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty- are just not sufficient to guarantee that Australian uranium will not be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780530_reps_31_hor109/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I asked in this House on Monday and Tuesday whether, when the Government cannot sell its uranium overseas with its so-called stringent safeguards, it will cave in to countries like Iran, the Philippines and the European <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Community, which will not stand by and lose their sovereignty in a bilateral agreement to a small country like Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780601_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Officers ofthe New South Wales Health Commission and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission have met on a number of occasions, the latest being on 1 8 September. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-46-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That body superseded the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no evidence, no logic and certainly no credible hypothesis to support an accusation, so dear to the imagination of the former  Deputy  Leader of the Oppositionthat is, the honourable member for Reid- that the British broke the moratorium on <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions in the atmosphere in the period from 1958 to 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion in Australia occurred 26 years ago last week, and the last occurred 21 years ago this week. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were subsequently some experiments on radioactive substances related to nuclear weapons technology but no further <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise the words ‘no further <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosions’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise those words because the Melbourne  Age  newspaper, commenting editorially today, had some difficulty distinguishing between an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion qua <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion and nuclear experimentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surveys of the Maralinga area were undertaken in 1967 and 1 972 by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No <span class="highlight">atomic</span> devices were exploded during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1 96 1 , and no unexploded nuclear device was buried. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it true that, during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, Australia co-operated with the British in conducting secret <span class="highlight">atomic</span> ‘Trigger’ tests at Maralinga and that waste and debris from these tests were buried at Maralinga? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates to the Minister’s undertaking to provide the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition with information about the contaminated debris buried at Maralinga in South Australia subsequent to the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests there some 20 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968 the British <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Weapons Research establishment made a report concerning material buried at Maralinga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Detailed requirements for the condition in which Maralinga was to be left when British activity closed down were laid down in 1967 by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee set up by the Australian Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have explained that the British exploded 12 <span class="highlight">atomic</span> devices in Australia, three at Monte Bello, seven at Maralinga, and two at Emu Field near Maralinga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Maralinga and Emu areas were the subjects of a large scale clean-up operation conducted in 1967 to bring them to internationally acceptable standards set by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968 the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee informed the government of the day that it was satisfied that the area was radiologically safe, that permanent and unrestricted access could be made to all but a few small areas and that even they could be occupied on a short term basis without risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work involved specialist assistance from the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and the Bureau of Meteorology. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet another of the matters which this Government has had under active consideration- and one which lay behind Cabinet’s recent deliberations- relates to Australia’s obligations under the agreement signed with the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency consequent upon our accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In applying itself to the task of selectively misreporting a leaked Cabinet document, one newspaper has also suggested that the document demonstrated that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission could not handle the substance if it were exhumed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want to see <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons or nuclear proliferation because that is their particular bent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was it in one way a breach of the agreement made by the super powers, including Britain, between 19S8 and 1961, that no <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests would be conducted? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:  this House censures the Government for its incompetence and failure to adopt responsible nuclear policies and its misleading and contradictory statements about British <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons tests and forthwith calls upon the Government to appoint an independent committee of inquiry to report upon- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Penney, of course, was head of the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Research Establishment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The strong inference was that these tests were subsequent to the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests of 1957. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In a letter to me on 3 February 1 977 the Minister for Defence made reassuring remarks about surveys of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Test Safety Committee, but we know how reliable they were. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The United States Government is now engaged in a study of the health of personnel previously involved in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has his attention been drawn to the United States Government’s follow-up study on personnel who were involved in their past <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-To make any sense at all of the convoluted logic of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  and the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  would require that I was a Nobel Prize winner in <span class="highlight">atomic</span> physics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have no massive industry here involved in plutonium or <span class="highlight">atomic</span> physics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to demonstrate, and it has been effectively demonstrated ever since the early <span class="highlight">atomic</span> testing commenced at Maralinga and later at Emu, that at all times, within the confines of known scientific knowledge of the time, all actions were taken to ensure that the necessary protective measures were introduced at those locations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When independent Australian surveys had confirmed that the site was radiologIcally safe, a Termination Agreement ending the arrangements for British use of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons proving ground at Maralinga was signed in September 1 968. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I trust that we are all aware of the problems associated with <span class="highlight">atomic</span> waste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As far as the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is concerned they are perfectly able to solve the problem of the disposal of nuclear waste on their own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the Opposition has simply chosen to ignore the fact that the Australian Safeguards Office, which has already been established, is the body which in fact dictates how the Australian Government is to maintain standards acceptable to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency and other international bodies, to maintain standards in accordance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and other agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>According to new criteria of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency- the IAEA- which the Whitlam Administration agreed to accept in 1974, the Government has been required to examine all records of previous nuclear experiments to see whether any contaminated material was buried in Australia in relation to which the new and very rigid criteria of the IAEA could perhaps apply. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British Government has stated that no <span class="highlight">atomic</span> devices were exploded during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 19S8 and 1961. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not entirely beyond credibility that the British could have detonated an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb in the atmosphere at the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know what the mushroom cloud of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> test is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1968 the British <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Weapons Research Establishment made a report concerning material buried at Maralinga. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty refers directly to the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency with all of its requirements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet it suited him not to believe me when I pointed out in a letter written to him on 3 February 1977 what the United Kingdom Government had told me, namely, that no <span class="highlight">atomic</span> explosion had occurred at Maralinga in those years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the then Minister for Environment,  Dr Cass,  received a recommendation from the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council in, I think, 1974 that was designed to overturn an earlier recommendation of the Australian  <span class="highlight">Atomic</span>  Weapons Test Safety Committee in relation to handing land back to South Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time I would have thought that, having in mind the fact that the recommendation of AIRAC was seeking to overturn the suggestion or recommendation of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee, the nature of the recommendations would have caused him to ask questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that in those circumstances a Minister would have asked: ‘Why is AIRAC making a recommendation which overturns the suggestion or the view of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Weapons Tests Safety Committee?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does he not agree that these two plants would give Australia much better control over her own uranium supplies exported throughout the world, keep Australia in the forefront of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> science for energy and medical needs, and also demonstrate to the world our deep concern about the disposal of our own nuclear waste? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did the Commonwealth grant funds to MKU equivalent to the interest payments made by MKU to the United Kingdom <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Authority for uranium borrowed in 1976; if so, what was the total amount of these payments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s nuclear safeguards policy only allows the export of uranium to nuclear weapon states which give Australia an undertaking that nuclear material we supply for peaceful purposes will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that such material will be covered by International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-6">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As explained by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977, there will be no uranium exports under new contracts to any country unless and until there is a bilateral agreement in force which provides that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes or nuclear material derived from its use will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards will apply to verify compliance with this undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and (5) Information is not available on all such transfers, but on 1 1 January 1978 the major exporters of nuclear material, equipment and technology notified the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency that they would act in accordance with the principles contained in the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781012_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-35-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Annexed to the agreement are the proposed authority to mine under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the determination of payments under section 63 sub-section (5) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As honourable members will be aware, an inquiry under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 was established on 16 July 1975 to inquire into the development by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in association with Ranger uranium mines of uranium deposits in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Ranger entered into by the previous Government, the deposit will be mined under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and by the Commonwealth in partnership with Peko-EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expect that these negotiations with the companies will be concluded at an early date when the authority to mine under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act will issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This authority is given under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781107_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>By contrast, the Bureau of Meteorology will spend $37.6m and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission $22. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781114_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 25 August 1977 the Government announced its policy to develop the uranium ore deposits in the Ranger project area on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding of October 1975, which provided for mining to be undertaken under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd as joint venturers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard honourable members will recall that in June this year the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was amended to authorise the participation of the Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legally binding agreements to implement the Memorandum of Understanding are now being negotiated to establish the joint venture and thus enable an  authority ‘ to mine to be issued under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger joint venturers have pointed out that section 4 1 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, as it presently stands, does not provide them with adequate security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government, of course, also believes that the holders of an authority under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should not be disadvantaged in respect of such an important matter as security of tenure in comparison with prospective competitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 will introduce two new sections into the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, namely, sections 4lA and 41b. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781116_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Opposition sought to break the debate into two- a debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill and a debate on the Ranger statement and the statement on the Kakadu National Park agreement and memoranda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is discourteous of the Government not to have a separate debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, which is separate and distinct from the other two matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the main purpose of the legislation, and whilst one can understand that the Peko-EZ consortium is not prepared to make investments on the basis only of the memorandum of understanding or upon the whim and caprice of the incumbent Minister and that it seeks further security of tenure, it all points to the fact that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is the wrong legislation for the Government to have used for the development of the Ranger project and the Northern Territory uranium province. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger joint ventures have pointed out that section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, as it presently stands, does not provide them with adequate security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those are both admissions that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is inappropriate for uranium mining, even given the Government’s policy of moving ahead with uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essentially, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is a defence-oriented research Act and, because of that, it contains security measures which are not appropriate for a commercial mining operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As well as that, the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry was quite specific in its recommendations to the Government not to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for the purposes of the civil mining project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has not been done, and we are trying now to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act- I think there have already been a couple of amendments to date and now this one has been brought forward- to make it a more suitable vehicle for the development of the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole concept of using the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should have been scrapped and we should have left it alone as a research Act, an Act governing a research institution, and established a commercial mining Act so that at least the work force and the people involved with uranium mining were not subject to the kinds of penal provisions and draconian security measures incorporated in the present <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the Minister is not on record as saying that Pancontinental Mining Ltd, Queensland Mines Ltd or Noranda Australia Ltd will be subject to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, nevertheless, if what the Minister euphemistically calls his ‘sequence’ takes place and another rnining venture is given the right to mine under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, what could happen is that not only would Ranger come under the provisions of this Act, but also Queensland Mines, Noranda and others could come under its provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, whilst the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act now remains only applicable to Ranger, it could be the vehicle for the development of the Northern Territory uranium province- and a very inadequate and inappropriate vehicle it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reasonable, commendable indeed as that is, nevertheless, in the broad, the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is inappropriate for this kind of mining operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was a fall-back position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, that was the kind of atmosphere which the Parliament was in and it is now quite trite for the Minister to say that, because Labor used the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, we have to continue with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister ought to wake up to himself, get a decent piece of legislation and forget the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is opposed to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to implement that policy, as was recommended by the Fox Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I find it curious that the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  should have indicated that the Labor Party intends to oppose the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is extraordinary that the Labor Party, in opposing an agreement that it signed itself with Peko- Wallsend Ltd, in fact will be opposing the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act which it imposed upon the parties to that agreement and under which the agreement was signed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further to the point of whether such mining  regulations should be applied under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, I can do no better than quote from the statement made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of the Labor Party’s decision to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, those undertakings have been honoured. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I concede that many people who adopt an anti-uranium stance do so ibr honourable reasons, just as many people who take an anti-uranium stance do so for quite mischievous reasons which bring benefits to the providers of other energy sources and which, of course, assist the Russian bloc, which is a great user of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power, to the disadvantage of the Western bloc countries- the free nations of the world- which seek to use our uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree wholeheartedly with the proposition that there is a definite need to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act because, certainly, the tenure situation in respect of the ability of Peko- Wallsend Ltd to mine there was totally unsatisfactory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit- I agree with the honourable member for Blaxland on this point-that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act has not yet been effectively amended to provide that mining companies get a fair go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that in proposed section 41C which appears at page S of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act will be limited to this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-At the outset I protest against a cognate debate involving the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latest amendment to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act reveals more clearly than ever before that the Government’s single-minded strategy to lock Australia into the international nuclear fuel cycle and to repress the opposition of any citizen who threatens that strategy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  in his second reading speech was blatant in his admission that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is totally inappropriate for the commencement of mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That report clearly sets out the Ranger commissioners’ opposition to the use of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government shows no sign of amending the repressive, Cold War provisions of Part IV of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reason for patching up the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to apply to mining at Ranger. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We oppose this Bill because the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, as the Fox report pointed out, is totally inappropriate for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These amendments to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act do not prevent a Labor government from implementing Labor’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s panic changes to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act are a response to the concern of the potential uranium investors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will direct most of my remarks to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As mentioned by the Minister in his second reading speech, the Government announced its policy on 25 August 1977 to develop uranium ore deposits in the Ranger project area on the basis of the memorandum of understanding of October 1975, which provided for mining to be undertaken under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd as joint venturers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In June of this year the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was amended to authorise the participation of the Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes that the holders of an authority under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should not be disadvantaged in respect of such an important matter as security of tenure in comparison with prospective competitors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have mentioned before that we are in the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> age- whether we like it or not and if we do not mine, mill and market our uranium we will be left far behind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of this Bill, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister suggested that an authority to mine issued under section 4 1 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act failed to afford this security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On close examination of this legislation, it becomes clear that the present Government seeks to bind future governments to detailed authorities to mine uranium, issued under section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, regardless of any changes which take place in the nuclear industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is irresponsible that regardless of the findings of scientific studies of the consequences of mining on the environment of the uranium province no stricter safety measures could be imposed under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act as amended by the Bill before the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has already recorded its view that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is entirely inappropriate as a means of regulating and controlling commercial uranium mining operations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most recent joint International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development working party Report entitled ‘Uranium Resources, Production and Demand’ revised downward its nuclear power growth forecasts by up to SO per cent for the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In February this year Georg Woite of the International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency described the situation as follows: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The fact that this <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill is being opposed by the Opposition has already been highlighted by Opposition spokesmen but there are a number of points that I desire to make because I think it is time they were raised in this debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act- for the grant of an authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>still less that the local environmental controls be determined or supervised under the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It then goes on to crticise the general role of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ranger joint venturers have pointed out that section 14 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, as it presently stands, does not provide them with adequate security of tenure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I now invite the Minister to put those arguments because, whatever the differences that exist between the Government and the Australian Labor Party on this issue- they are considerable- at least the differences between us and the differences that exist within Australian society might well start to be resolved if the Government could put its arguments in a forthright and honest manner and not within the framework of an exercise of major political duplicity which is enshrined in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the amendments to it which are contained in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition does not mind the Government allowing adequate time for debating all matters which are listed on the program, but in this case it listed the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We make the objection that I have already made, namely, that it would have been easy for the Government to bring on for debate the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781122_reps_31_hor112/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Briefly, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow moneys from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and to give security and issue securities in respect of borrowings other than from the Commonwealth, to enable the Treasurer to guarantee repayment by the Commission of moneysborrowed other than from the Commonwealthand to provide that where securities are issued by the Commission, repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, honourable members will recall that in June last year, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act was amended to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to participate on behalf of the Commonwealth in a joint venture with Peko-EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will also recall that on 9 January 1 979 the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  signed the agreements and issued an authority under section 4 1 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to give effect to the Memorandum of Understanding. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his Budget Speech of 1 5 August 1978, the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  noted that a certain proportion of the Commonwealth’s share of the costs of developing the Ranger uranium deposits would be raised by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission through borrowings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existing provisions in section 27 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act are inadequate to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow moneys on the semi-government market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These provisions retain the co-ordinating role of the Public Service Board in relation to terms and conditions of staff employed by the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790503_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-The Government has sought again to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this occasion it has sought to amend the original Act, which was enacted in 1953, to empower the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow money on the open money market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have now a silly situation in which, under the Ranger uranium consortium arrangement, the Government has the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission out seeking markets for its half of Ranger’s production. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That could not in any way be conducive to a happy corporate marriage between the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and Peko-EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission undertakes a variety of functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should not be empowered to raise funds on the commercial market for uranium mining until such time as the unresolved problems associated with the nuclear industry have been satisfactorily resolved: and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 ) the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is an inappropriate legislative basis for nuclear energy research and development and for commercial activities and should be repealed and replaced by legislation to establish- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a government corporation to conduct the present commercial activities of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, such as the production and marketing of radioisotopes: and <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition believes that that is a thoroughly appropriate amendment to this legislation and moves it in the clear knowledge that the Government has established a committee of review to review the activities of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it is a committee that we believe has inadeqate terms of reference- terms which pre-determine the result to the review in the direction of the retention of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in a modified form as a national centre for energy research, and prevents the consideration of alternative forms of national energy research centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems about building an energy research and development agency around the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is that, basically, the weight of 25 years of bureaucratic experience will direct the whole thrust of such an agency towards the nuclear area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason, the Opposition suggests that we break up the Com: mission so that it will have a commercial function- a function to handle nuclear medicine, radioisotopes and such matters- and an independent regulatory authority responsible for environmental matters, including the Australian Safeguards Office which, even though it has a specific safeguards function, is an integral part of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in as much as it reports through the  Chairman  of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would propose to break it up further by forming a nuclear science authority which would do the kinds of things that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has done since its inception. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission within an energy research and development agency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were foolish enough to believe that the aims ofthe research and development agency would not be diluted by the force of 25 years of nuclear research and a career structure in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission which would be heavily involved in this research and development agency, one would be very much mistaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some but not all of the people who were in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission– <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were Ministers in the McMahon Government who wanted Australia to have a nuclear weapon and there were elements in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission which were prepared to accommodate that view and to comply with it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Jervis Bay project was built around that and it was to be the reason for the establishment of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, about 55 per cent of all Commonwealth expenditure on energy research and development goes into nuclear power through the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Translated into the total research effort- that is, Commonwealth and private- through universities, companies and other institutions, we find that the allocation for the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission takes 35 per cent of the total funds available for energy research and development in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred to the conflict of the various roles that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has- its nuclear regulatory role, as a promoter of nuclear power, as a promoter of nuclear research, and now as a commercial activist in the uranium mining area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I just make the point that the United States, Britain, Canada and West Germany have broken up their <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy commissions into the kind of organisation which we propose in the amendments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though we do not have nuclear power programs in this country there are many related matters which require a competent, independent, nuclear regulatory body, and not one modelled on the Australian Safeguards Office, which is still part of the Commission, which has Commission staff, and which reports to the  chairman  of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is an inappropriate vehicle for the commercial mining of uranium, or for any commercial mining, because under that Act any project can be declared a defence project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has stuck with the concept because of the memorandum of understanding between the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and Peko-EZ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But all the same the Government has run out on that spirit by having the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission seek to find its own markets overseas and let Peko-EZ rot. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has this hotch-potch of an institution, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, constantly amended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that if it is carried it will be the best thing for Australia in respect of the policy for commercial uranium mining, and also in terms of the breaking up and the re-establishment of the various sections of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission into separate independent bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-This is the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill, which seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be of interest to look at the original Act and in it the formation of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In spite of what the member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  had to say, the basic functions of the Act are: Firstly, exploration, mining, treatment and selling of uranium; secondly, the construction and operation of atomicpower stations; thirdly, the research and distribution of information on uranium and <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Act was a widening of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy (Control of Material) Act 1946 and 1952, which was repealed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This shows that the early Menzies governments appreciated that <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy was the energy of the future, even in those days. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then on 9 January 1 979 we had the historic Government agreement on the Ranger uranium project between the Commonwealth of Australia, Peko-Wallsend Operations Ltd, Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd, and the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the original Act of 1953 to provide the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission with the necessary powers to borrow money in order to fulfil its obligations in connection with this Ranger agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This amendment to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is just one part of the implementation of the uranium export policy stated on 1 June 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should not be empowered to raise funds on the commercial market for uranium mining until such time as the unresolved problems associated with the nuclear industry have been satisfactorily resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members had better forget any idea they may have that we are discussing a narrow concept of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, because one cannot divorce the interrelationship of one aspect from the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is a repressive piece of legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1953 the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was set up for the primary purpose of ‘ensuring the provision of uranium or <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy for the defence of the Commonwealth’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secondary purposes for the establishment of the Commission were to ensure the supply of uranium or <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy to governments of other countries and ‘any other purposes of the Commonwealth’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a defence Act and it was intended to allow the supply of Australian uranium to Britain and to the United States of America for the purpose of making <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1976 the Fox report criticised the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act for being too restrictive on civil liberties, and, in particular, the curtailment of public access to information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Fox reportits correct name is the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry report, as I mentioned earlierrecommended against the use ofthe <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to grant authority to Ranger to mine uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, which we are discussing tonight- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On pages 248 to 252 of the report are set out the arguments as to why the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act should not be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1978 the Federal Government amended the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, making its purposes more directly related to the commercial aspect of uranium mining and export and imposing even more restrictive curtailments on civil liberties and trade union action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a situation in relation the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act where those people who support uranium mining and its export say that that is an important and progressive move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, in 1 979, a further amendment is being made to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act- an Act designed to make provision for the defence of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That repressive Act is now being amended again for the explicit purpose of allowing the AtomicEnergy Commission to raise funds on the commercial market for the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paper also sets out the reduced forecasts of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973-74 the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission expected that it would need 1 15,000 tonnes of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in its 1977-78 report estimated that Australia could sell 10,000 tonnes in 1985. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore in one year the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s estimate dropped from 17,000 to 10,000 tonnes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is now privately admitting that it will be lucky to sell 2,000 tonnes a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have a paper headed ‘<span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission Estimates from the last four years of future annual requirements of the Western World for uranium’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said earlier that we cannot divorce peaceful uses for <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy and nuclear war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This Bill seeks to amend the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1 953 and is known as the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill 1979. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to borrow moneys from the Commonwealth or elsewhere and to give security and issue securities in respect of borrowings other than from the Commonwealth to enable the Treasurer to guarantee repayment by the Commission of moneysborrowed other than from the Commonwealthand to provide that where securities are issued by the Commission, repayment is guaranteed by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions in respect of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act are totally inadequate to enable money to be borrowed on the semi-government market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-In a calm and rational way I would like to bring this debate back to the provisions of the Bill before the House and to talk about this proposal of the Government to widen the powers of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, because it is the view of the Opposition that this Act is not the appropriate vehicle or umbrella for the purposes that the Government is seeking to attribute to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having been involved with this matter for a long time and being the member for the area which contains Australia’s only <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor, I have had the good fortune to be able to associate with many of the 1,200 people whose lives are bound up with the continuation of the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy program in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make no apology for the fact that I act as something of a watchdog for the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor at Lucas Heights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The discharge into the river is of such consequence that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission has not yet been able apparently to meet the requirements of the Sydney Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board and, therefore, is unable to discharge its effluent into the sewer main of Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that my initial questions on this matter probably sparked off the interest of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission in actually instituting a safety plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that we ought to regard seriously the fact that a responsible newspaper with a very large circulation has contended that recently the Holsworthy artillery range was responsible for jettisoning a shell or some explosive device which landed on the road in fairly close proximity to Australia’s only <span class="highlight">atomic</span> reactor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The attitude of the Opposition to the Bill is that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission should not be empowered to raise funds for uranium mining on the commercial market until such time as the unresolved problems associated with the nuclear industry have been resolved satisfactorily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition contends also that the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is an inappropriate legislative basis for nuclear energy research and development and for commercial activities and that it should be repealed and replaced by other legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will not bear the odium; the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission is to go on the market. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reasons for extending commercial powers to the Commission arise from the Government’s decision to use the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act to mine the Ranger uranium deposit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>After all, this Bill is designed to strengthen the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, even though obviously that Act is the wrong vehicle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 41 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act gives wide powers to the Commonwealth which are not appropriate for a commercial body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want my constituents, who are decent people with a great economic investment in terms of a career in the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, as scientists, physicists and specialists of various kinds, to get caught up in the politicalisation of this whole racket. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the extremely repressive provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the associated Approved Defence Projects Protection Act, the Government has the power to deny ordinary industrial rights to the workers and unions involved in the mining, handling and transportation of uranium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As was made clear during the debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Act 1978 in the Senate on 29 May 1978, the Government’s policy is that penal provisions enacted for defence purposes would not be applied to the Ranger project. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Very recently the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden),  in a submission to the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission Review of Research and Development Activities, put an alternative proposal which would no doubt be acceptable to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and to the workers of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one looks at the document which has been produced by the Parliamentary Library and which shows the role of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, one finds that, so far, that Commission has experienced a cavalcade of very serious disappointments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790509_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I doubt very much that the Opposition would agree that in future a legislation committee should meet while an amendment to the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act is being debated in the House, because obviously there is a great deal of interest in that Act and the Parliament is clearly divided as to how that Act ought to be utilised for the benefit of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>When an issue as important as the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act comes on for debate, when five honourable members on this side of the House and three honourable members on the other side of the House are listed to speak, and when the debate is proceeding normally on an issue in relation to which there is genuine division and concern in the Australian community, the House cannot function in the circumstance of the Government Whip, acting either on whim - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would be subject to criticism from their constituents because they were not in the House but attending a committee meeting authorised by the House when an issue, such as <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy or whatever it may be, was being discussed in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790510_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are: an undertaking that nuclear material supplied by Australia will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes; the application of International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency- IAEA- safeguards, which provide an international check against diversion of material; fall-back arrangements to ensure continued safeguarding of nuclear material should IAEA safeguards for any reason cease to apply; a requirement for Australia’s prior consent to any retransfers, to ensure that uranium supplied by Australia cannot be re-exported unless we are satisfied as to the ultimate destination and as to the controls that would apply; a requirement for Australia’s prior consent for high enrichment or reprocessing of material supplied by Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We also note that a very senior officer of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, again in a personal capacity, has proposed a quite radical new approach to international nuclear co-operative activities for the avoidance of nuclear proliferation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part of this Bill also brings to the legislative table a decision- in this regard I look forward very much to the interdepartmental committee’s recommendations- which allows certain government departments and statutory bodies such as the Australian National University, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission to import certain goods free of duty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790531_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As a result the Government in formulating its nuclear safeguards policy decided that any future sales arrangements for exports of Australian uranium should be such that the uranium will be in a form which attracts full International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the event of the NPT safeguards agreement or of other full-scope International <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Agency safeguards not applying, Australia would have the right to institute its own safeguards, but only in respect of material supplied by Australia or equivalent quantities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790823_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 4 1 of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act 1953 which concerns mining for prescribed substances on behalf of or in association with the Commonwealth, and to amend a number of the security provisions of the Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the security provisions of the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act, the Government’s policy that penal provisions which were largely enacted for defence purposes would not be applied to ordinary commercial undertakings, was made clear in the debate on the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Bill (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 6 of the Bill repeals section 60 of the principal Act which applies the stringent provisions of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 to all works of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission including commercial undertakings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause substitutes a provision which requires that a notice be published in the Gazette, by the Minister, if the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act is to apply to a work of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that the present amendments do not affect in any way the powers provided by the <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Amendment Act 1978 to enable the Commonwealth to implement nuclear non-proliferation safeguards in Australia pursuant to the Government’s international obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To support energy research and development, the Australian Government made available almost $ 15.5m for commitment in 1978-79, additional to that provided through normal funding for such activity to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission and other bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790911_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-This evening I want to discuss for a few moments the question of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> energy and the production of uranium in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1947 the Labour Party of Great Britain first used <span class="highlight">atomic</span> uranium to explode the first bomb. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that purpose it has built a large number of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power reactors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790912_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Council goes on to say that, if the Government does decide not to sell, it should establish a separate commercial authority to take over the management of its interest -from the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, leaving the Commission to carry out its nuclear and other energy research and advisory functions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is in line with what the Australian Labor Party has been saying about splitting the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s functions and having a commercial authority to manage the commercial activities of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790913_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition, the Government has elected to proceed, contrary to the recommendations of the Fox Commission, with the mining of uranium at Ranger under the repressive <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Act and the related Approved Defence Projects Protection Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In June 1953 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were electrocuted in Sing Sing prison on a charge of conspiracy to commit espionage in wartime, for passing on technical details of <span class="highlight">atomic</span> weapons to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in September 1945, still technically during wartime, at a time when Russia was an ally of the United States of America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The judge’s reaction was based on an assumption that the USSR had no high level technical capacity and that the only way it could develop an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb was by stealing secrets from the Americans. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He also assumed that a bloody and prolonged war in a divided nation with a 3,000 year history was not the product of domestic pressures but the direct result of a sketch of an <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb component drawn from memory by a machinist with no scientific training. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, material about the <span class="highlight">atomic</span> bomb which 20 years ago was regarded as terribly secret is now available for open scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is, of course, gratified that the Council of European Communities yesterday adopted a mandate enabling the European Commission to negotiate a nuclear safeguards agreement with Australia on behalf of the European <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Community; that is, Euratom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such work as is done, is mostly undertaken by the Austraiian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission which keeps comprehensive records of all employees who may be exposed to radiation or radioactive contamination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commonwealth and State Government departments and establishments involved in nuclear activities such as the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australian Radiation Laboratory, and State Health Departments would be a massive undertaking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-34-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, conversions from direct current to alternating current, from imperial measurement to metric or from diesel to liquefied petroleum gas could probably be regarded as technical; technological is far broader, involving the sum of knowledge of the means and methods of producing goods and services; for example, conversion from fossil fuels to <span class="highlight">atomic</span> power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790925_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission estimates of annual world demand for uranium have dropped from 115,000 tonnes in 1973 to 54,000 tonnes in 1978 and that the surplus in world uranium production will be more than 30,000 tonnes a year by 1985, does this not mean that Australian uranium will be in acute oversupply and will be sold into a buyers market with tumbling prices and safeguards deterioration? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The length of the operating life of the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission’s HIFAR reactor might be determined by any of the following technical and economic indicators: unacceptable deterioration of vital components which could only be replaced with great difficulty and cost; unavailability of imported components or materials which need to be replaced, such as fuel or heavy water; increased costs related to maintenance, operation or fuel; the incapacity of the plant to meet demands for radioisotopes and scientific research in terms of neutron flux, volume of irradiation space, quality of neutron beams and plant reliability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-38-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following remarks that were made last week by the Premier of New South Wales,  Mr Wran,  concerning the closing down of the Lucas Heights reactor for servicing, there was a reaction from the Premier of Western Australia that, if the Australian <span class="highlight">Atomic</span> Energy Commission was considering putting in a new reactor for the production of isotopes and for research work, his Government would be very willing to have it established in Western Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
