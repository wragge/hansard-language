<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I ask him whether, in view of the modern trend towards undeclared wars by <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and terrorism - which is so obvious in Laos at the moment - the Crimes Act can be revised, possibly in consultation with the <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The political context in which the five-power arrangements have been couched is for consultation in the event of armed attack externally fomented or in the case of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and insurgency externally fomented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710421_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer the Prime Minister to the statement made by his predecessor to the Five Power Conference held in this Parliament House on 19th June 1969, when the right honourable member for Higgins said that the Australian forces in the Malaysia-Singapore region have ‘the objective of assisting - and I emphasise the word “assisting” - in defence against external aggression or <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which can be clearly seen to stem from without the region and can be clearly seen to be supported by external regimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19721012_reps_27_hor81/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of these statistics will the Minister advise the House whether he is satisfied that this level of industrial disputation indicates that there is a minimum degree of political and economic <span class="highlight">subversion</span> going on in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770921_reps_30_hor106/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every democracy, by its very freedom, contains the potential for its own <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One factor which cannot be discounted is the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> of the public mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will do them by following this clear path through the undergrowth of Communist aggression and <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which is rolling our way; by getting with our country and being prepared to do something extra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-28-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 21 years since the Liberal-Country Party coalition came to power we have heard a lot about the Communist Party but not one case of Communist Party <span class="highlight">subversion</span> has been brought to trial in those 21 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there has been any Communist <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in that time obviously the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has fallen down on the job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the honourable member knows of a case of Communist <span class="highlight">subversion</span> let him submit it to the proper authorities so that charges may be laid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700415_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A wave of international Communist <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and aggression has throught unrest to Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, Korea, Indonesia and Indo-China as it then was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-23-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because for some years after the close of the Second World War, resolute action was taken to resist and defeat <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in Malaya as it then was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700422_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are concerned with the Opposition’s application of its own Brezhnev doctrine to Asia but, above all, we are particularly sad to see that the Opposition, from having been a peace party in the past, has made a full turn to become a pacifist party and has now adopted a clear policy of favouring aggression in Cambodia under a doctrine which was itself responsible for the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> of Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700506_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has stated repeatedly that the fundamental objective of Australia and other Allied countries assisting the Republic of Vietnam is the preservation of the South Vietnamese people’s right to determine their own future free from external aggression and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700512_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-26-13">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The East African countries, for example, arc vulnerable to Soviet military pressure and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700514_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the contrary, the activities of Communist countries have been solely in terms of military measures designed to ensure a Communist victory in and Communist <span class="highlight">subversion</span> of these 3 or 4 - however honourable members like to describe them - former countries of the Indo-Chinese peninsula. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the mutual problem of a common enemy operating sometimes with open aggression, sometimes by <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and political blackmail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not seem to be getting far with the technique of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is said that <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is active in Australia today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one person has been prosecuted for <span class="highlight">subversion</span> since  Dr Evatt  launched a prosecution for <span class="highlight">subversion</span> when he was the Attorney-General in the Chifley Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet we hear this cry of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, particularly by the honourable member for Evans  (Dr Mackay). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are its officers being paid for if there is <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700827_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Asia there is a struggle against the offensive Communist states, coupled, let me emphasise, with other important developments in this under-developed region, but using all those varied cold war techniques of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, insurgency and a whole variety of threats to the integrity of the small nations they wish to bring under their domination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This strength has been used already to support aggression and <span class="highlight">subversion</span> of neighbours and thus upset the world balance of power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1961 amendments to the Crimes Act were dramatically rushed through the Parliament to save this country from the peril of existing <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and treason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its purpose was to root out <span class="highlight">subversion</span> within the community and to protect the security of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700904_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-18-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer particularly to Indonesia and South Africa which both live under the threat of Communist aggression and <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and which both resist it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">subversion</span> has been a great success here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700924_reps_27_hor69/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During this debate it has already been implied, and it will be implied, that members of the Opposition are guilty of treachery, treason, sedition and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, Malaysia will look for some indication of integrity and some indication that Communist China would refrain from <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and aggression in South East Asia; secondly, Malaysia still recognises the dangers of the Communist menace to neutrality in the region, and thirdly, Malaysia will continue to - contribute to peace and stability in the region of South East Asia, lt is our policy that if one has to negotiate on matters such as the neutrality of South East Asia, one should negotiate from a position of strength and not weakness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To do so would tend, as he would, 1 think, on reflection well appreciate, to undermine or compromise the very useful activities that are carried out in this field of countering <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and politically inspired terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701022_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This, in the deep south, was <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and sin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710217_reps_27_hor71/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened to the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  who revealed a few moments of brilliance when he was rattling off appropriate words to describe divisions, lack of loyalty, treachery, <span class="highlight">subversion</span> within political parties and lack of collective responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710315_reps_27_hor71/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is always assumed by governments like the McMahon Government to be disorder or <span class="highlight">subversion</span> although all the rights, privileges, living standards and money that most Government supporters enjoy have been won in the past by other people, by earlier generations, with precisely this kind of action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In more recent times continental China, to use the title in- vogue ai the moment, has earned a reputation for encouraging instability and <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in the region and, in the case of Tibet and India, committing actual aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another thing that the Leader of the Opposition has underestimated in recent times is the determination of the Australian people to make a contribution where <span class="highlight">subversion</span> by Communist powers could possibly threaten our future security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710422_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new agreement arranges for consultation when the areas are believed to be the subject of attack directly or an internal <span class="highlight">subversion</span> inspired from without. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710503_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malaysia and Thailand, Burma, and  Ceylon  have still to contend with insurgency and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710818_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a substantial responsibility to help the states newly established or fast emerging in the South Pacific because few things could be more damaging to Australia’s long term interests than for any of the island states or territories in the South Pacific to degenerate through lack of proper development assistance into a sort of maritime slum with all the potential for future <span class="highlight">subversion</span> or aggression that such a condition may create. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710823_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communist China has troops and engineers in Tanzania ostensibly to build a railway line, and Chinese Commuist <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, terror, investment and influence in Zambia, Uganda, the Congo and Guinea are a continuing threat to any hopes of African democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>; Secondly, there is the developing military and nuclear power of China together wilh her history of helping <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and insurgency movements throughout South East Asia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710928_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I instance the wars of national liberation, which are based upon <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and the destruction of the fabric of a prosperous and permissive society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again and again I have heard members of the Opposition asserting that the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and the destruction of the fabric of the society of Indo-China is simply an illustration of civil war and that we ought not to be taking part in the attempts to defend our friends. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We wish to live in friendship with the Chinese, but to say that there is not going to be <span class="highlight">subversion</span> or any threat of trouble in South East Asia is absolute rubbish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had it not been for the United States, we may not today be living under conditions which allow us to criticise and knock all our friends and to absolutely adore those countries which have engaged in <span class="highlight">subversion</span> throughout South East Asia and which have not acted in the best interests of peace in this part of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were allotted the province of Phuoc Tuy, a province with a history of underground <span class="highlight">subversion</span> against the Saigon Government which went back many years into the days of the French occupation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711125_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in short, the judgment is a victory for Chief Justice Barwick and for Professor Richardson and a slap in the face to those who, over many years, have used the celebrated section 92 of the Constitution as an  instrument of constitutional <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711201_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have to provide for a great variety of politico-military situations, including <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, insurgency, revolutionary warfare and other types of low intensity conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711208_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In South East Asia the impact of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and insurgency has been restricted by massive sacrifices of men and material on the part of many countries - not least the states of Indo-China under attack from North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the elimination of both <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and insurgency continues to demand, in at least 6 countries, very great efforts on the part of the governments concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It supports, encourages and carries out <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, murder, kidnapping, bomb and rocket attacks on innocent civilians, as well as carrying on the more conventional types of warfare. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720412_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>able to take it over by democratic means and they resorted to assassination, <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and destruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one organised group - and one only - planning for <span class="highlight">subversion</span>; not for the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> of the Australian Government, but for the overthrow by violence of the Government of Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720420_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But, of course, every time that question of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> has been raised, honourable members opposite reply back to Lin Piao, who is now somewhat in eclipse in Communist China but who has been a whipping horse for this Government in times past. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us take what I suppose is, for this House, the unprecedented step of having a look at what Lin Piao actually said about <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the seal of approval on the strategy of war by <span class="highlight">subversion</span> to accept them as the negotiating authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720523_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Or are we in Australia interested only in controlling <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in overseas Communist countries? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720815_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is never a word said by either of those 2 gentlemen or the Leader of the Opposition in respect to the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and the other things that are going on in this country that affect the children of this country and the future of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720816_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Tn regard to the old communist bogy that has been kicked about for many, many years the fact is, of course, that there has not been one communist guilty of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in Australia since this Government assumed office in 1949. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720829_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to build an effective force to combat crime and to combat <span class="highlight">subversion</span> I believe we have to build a higher standard of police force in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The statute of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation requires it to be concerned with the security of Australia, and the security of Australia is defined in the statute as referring to espionage, sabotage and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720920_reps_27_hor80/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But think of a situation which is not external aggression or internal <span class="highlight">subversion</span> but is a civil disorder, and Australian forces willy-nilly become involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730301_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The truth of the matter is that in the last 3 decades the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have all been subject to a clearly identified communist <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, a communist attack. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Labor Party, having noted the reluctance of colonial powers to give up their colonies - a reluctance which led to wars of national liberation, <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and bloodshed - was determined that the distresing lessons of history should not be repeated in Australia’s colony - Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the interests of Australia and, in particular, the Northern Territory, because of its geographic susceptibility to internal <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, will the Attorney-General &lt;a) re-instate the Northern Territory Police Special Branch and &lt;b) return control of the Northern Territory Police to its rightful place, i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731213_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-72-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They used the expression ‘that super power which seeks world hegemony, which, while mouthing the slogans of detente, engages in <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, pressure and terrorism, which militarily occupies those unfortunate enough to be called its allies and which is trying to win the emerging world into its orbit’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750408_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-31-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The creeping communism of Russia is still edging forward, whether it is in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, whether it is with the fleets around us, whether it is in the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in South East Asia or whether it is the way in which communism edges forward in Europe because we do not have the fortitude to stand up against what it is doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760407_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suppose that the last comment I could make about the query of the honourable member for Oxley would be that if the events that were reflected in the phrase ‘the domino theory’ had begun to take place in the way desired by those who were responsible for the internal <span class="highlight">subversion</span> of these other nations and if they had been successful, most Australians today would have an entirely different outlook on defence matters and a far greater sensitivity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761020_reps_30_hor101/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find that Australia faces and has faced, or may face, threats to its internal security and that ASIO should investigate espionage, active measures, <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, sabotage, terrorism, the organisation in Australia of or assistance for violent political activity in foreign countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Heaven forbid, but the man whom this House convicted of economic <span class="highlight">subversion</span>- we know what those words mean,  Mr Deputy Speaker-  is actually to be put in charge of the defence of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-90">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it inconceivable that any man condemned by this House for economic <span class="highlight">subversion</span> could be regarded as a fit or proper person - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-90">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I used the words ‘economic <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19771027_reps_30_hor107/#debate-90">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, by defining <span class="highlight">subversion</span> as any activity judged to be on the left of the political spectrum and determined by unsound and irrational criteria the security services have been guilty of objectionable interference with the civil liberties of people who are not a threat to security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780223_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me this is just a catalogue of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780301_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If some trade union official is prepared to tell the honourable member for Casey that all this <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is going on surely that evidence would have been made available to the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again there is no evidence to suggest that there was any <span class="highlight">subversion</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should make a distinction here because I do not believe that <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and disruption to industry is the response from all trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that the honourable member for Port Adelaide is not out to disrupt the system- he wants to see economic recovery and the creation of jobs in this country just as much as every member on this side of the chamber does- but I would be surprised if the honourable member and his colleagues do not recognise that the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> that is coming from the trade union movement is not general and that it is engaged in by political activists within the trade union movement who are determined to subvert not only this Government but also the economic structure of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although at this moment it is a less pressing concern there is no guarantee that international relations in South East Asia have completely stabilised or that all the present Governments in the area are immune from <span class="highlight">subversion</span> from internal or external sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780926_reps_31_hor111/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not like to rake over coals so I will do no more than to remind the Parliament and the nation that it was on 4 October 1977 that this House took the most unprecedented step of formally censuring one of its members for his economic <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and total irresponsibility with respect to the strength and standing of the Australian dollar. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781011_reps_31_hor111/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the first place, any expression of its views is not only irrelevant in that it does not have legislative power to take a moral legislative view on abortion, but also any attempts to do so would involve a <span class="highlight">subversion</span> of the rights of sovereign States in this area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790322_reps_31_hor113/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be noted that, in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission, the definition of ‘security’ in the present Act has been expanded to include not only espionage, sabotage and <span class="highlight">subversion</span> but also active measures of foreign intervention (meaning clandestine or deceptive action taken by a foreign power to promote the interests of that power) and terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790522_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>the redefinition of the concept of ‘security’, and in particular the element of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span> ‘, in order to narrow its scope and limit the possibility of its mis-application; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Probably the aspect of the Bill which occupied most of the debate, particularly in the Senate was the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in clause 5 of the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want to make it very clear what we are about when we are defining <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Report of  Mr Justice  White into Special Branch Security Records in South Australia is, I believe, an excellent exposition of the concept of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What comes out clearly from that Report is that the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> should be confined as narrowly as possible, and that the central element involved is that of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790828_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was on that basis that we suggested that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted and that it provide, for example, for annual reports to the Parliament so that the Parliament itself could be fully informed of the activities of the intelligence organisation; that there be a regular, periodic judicial audit so that the guarantee was there that the organisation had complied with its charter and that it did not interfere with civil liberties; that it operated effectively and efficiently; that the responsible Minister be fully informed by the Director-General of ASIO on all matters other than the contents of files relating to particular individuals; that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects if he so wished; that there be proper financial accountability of ASIO; that there be a redefinition of the concept of security and, in particular, the element of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in order to narrow its scope and limit the possibility of its misapplication; that the restriction of circumstances in which the times at which warrants may be issued also be properly controlled; that a security appeals system be given retrospective operation as recommended by the Hope report; that no person be denied notification of the existence of an adverse security assessment; and that communication of information purporting to identify an ASIO employee or agent be penalised only when such information would endanger the safety of such person or persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the Committee stage we will be moving amendments to each of the three elements of the definition of ‘domestic <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ under proposed section 5(1) in order to limit their scope and to prevent them being used as an excuse for stupid and objectionable forays by ASIO into domestic politics as distinct from domestic <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the redefinition of the concept of ‘security’, and in particular the element of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’, in order to narrow its scope and limit the possibility of its misapplication; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a regrettable necessity that any country will need intelligence agencies of some kind to protect it against forms of external espionage, <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, sabotage and terrorism by foreign powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it is an evilperhaps a necessary evil- that we may also require intelligence agencies to counter internally generated <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, sabotage and terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the kinds of activities that active persons with a social conscience and a vision of a better Australia are entitled to be involved in without the brand of suspected <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We desire a redefinition of the concept of security, in particular of the critical element of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The very definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ is wide open. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst I can understand the all-embracing application of the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, I can also understand the concern of some people and, indeed, the demands of some people that there must be more accountability than simply a short report or a report to a particular Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are the kinds of activities that active persons with a social conscience and a vision of a better Australia are entitled to be involved in without the brand of suspected <span class="highlight">subversion</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will argue in the Committee stage that the present definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ is too wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We propose that there should be a better definition of security and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A security organisation must be careful to avoid mistaking mere dissent or non-conformity for <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition also objects to a wide range of activity- phone tapping surveillance, the entering of premises, et cetera- in which ASIO will be legally able to engage because of the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 5 ( 1 ) (a) of the Bill defines <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ as: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only minor concession made by the Government in respect of the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ was to accept the replacement in clause 5 ( 1 ) (c) of the word ‘hostility ‘ with the word ‘hatred ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first of them is the definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the arguments about the definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ are well known. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I must say that over the four years that I was looking intently at the matter I was driven to the conclusion, although I disliked it, that there was too much concentration in specificareas where I did not think that <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, sabotage or anything similar was involved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third part of the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ states:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security is defined as the protection of the people from espionage, sabotage, <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, active measures of foreign intervention or terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Subversion</span> is defined as including activities that involve, will involve or lead to or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to the use of force or violence or the unlawful acts- we can imagine what would occur in the situation of an unlawful act in Petersen country- which might cause the destruction of the Government, hinder the activities of the Defence Forces or promote violence or hostility between groups so as to endanger peace, order and good government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the matters of concern expressed to me- the right honourable member for Lowe mentioned this matter earlier- is the interpretation of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ as contained in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do know that ASIO spent a good deal of time snooping around trade unions trying to find out what unionists were doing but so far as actual, active, serious work in security is concerned in relation to <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, real or apparent, and trying to deal with terrorism ASIO has no track record at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is an alarming kind of logical slide which says in effect that advocating change is the equivalent of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is the equivalent of political illegitimacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one goes on one will see that there are proposals to narrow the definitions of ‘security’ and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ and to narrow the scope of the inquiries that the Organisation might be able to make. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 ( 1 ) (a) defines <span class="highlight">subversion</span> as activities that are ultimately likely to lead to violence for the purpose of overthrowing a constitutional government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It defines <span class="highlight">subversion</span> as:  activities directed to promoting violence or hatred between different groups of persons . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Distasteful as the powers may be, there is a strong case to be made for their inclusion in the legislation if the nation is to keep up its guard against espionage, sabotage, <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and terrorism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would like the committee to consider the definitions or the redefinitions of the concept of security and the element of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in order to narrow their scope and to limit the possibility of their misapplication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In otherwords, the proposed committee should define the aim of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and state exactly what it should be looking for, what exactly is <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we define security and <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in a sense so broad that it encompasses anything which would involve a change in the way of life in this country, it is much too broad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it is important that we define very clearly the questions of security and <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole idea of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is based upon terrorism and violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I turn now to the two definitions of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’, which I believe are too wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not tell me that we could not agree around the table on a definition of what we think is <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790919_reps_31_hor115/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 relates to the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> when not of foreign origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has been a lot of comment on how difficult it is to define <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At present the clause defines <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in this way: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody agrees that any act which has the intention of destroying the constitutional government is <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Subversion</span> is difficult to define, but is nonetheless  . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, if the <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is very real and very dangerous there must certainly be a fair amount of evidence as to its reality and the dangerous nature of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe that the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> should be centred on the question of the reality of violent action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Hope endeavoured to say: <span class="highlight">Subversion</span> does mean overthrow and ruin; it does have a direct relation to activity associated with the immediate overthrow of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By doing that we would at least put some stress back on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to consider fully the definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span> ‘, which is far too wide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for a very wide definition and interpretation of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The product of the kinds of attitudes to <span class="highlight">subversion</span> contained in this definition leads to the abuses described by  Mr Justice  White in his report on the South Australian Special Branch in the early 1950s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that we need to remove the word ‘ultimately’ from paragraph (a) of subclause (1) of clause 5 because, as I said at the outset, it would at least put some pressure back on to ASIO to be more careful when it handles, when it deals with and when it acts under all the inferences contained in this rather wide-ranging definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That part can be left out for the purposes of the meaning of the clause- that are to be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversion</span> are - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is troubling about this dragnet definition of the word <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ and what makes it different from the definition of ‘arson’, ‘theft’, ‘rape’ or any other kind of offence is that all those offences have an objective element in them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are not even saying that <span class="highlight">subversion</span> consists of a particular matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition simply refers to activities which are to be regarded subjectively, in somebody else’s judgment, as <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is far from saying that it is <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, that it is to be defined as a particular offence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman,  I draw your attention to the definitions of espionage, sabotage, <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, security and so on, and I then move on to the amendment to clause 5. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 5 ( 1 ) (a), in dealing with the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> when not of foreign origin’, reads:  activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key words, of course, are ‘security’ and ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Chairman, with respect, what I am trying to show is that, if we are talking about the word ‘ultimately’ and what these facts will ultimately lead to, it is obvious that they will ultimately lead to a threat of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> or a threat to security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely a proper examination of what is meant there must hinge on what is meant by ‘security’ and ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why, during the late 1960s and early 1970s we had the spectacle of ASIO agents placing under surveillance people who marched in anti-Vietnam demonstrations- clergymen, academics and trade union leaders- because in their judgment those actions were ultimately bound to lead to threats against security and constituted <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, in relation to the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’, again all the personnel are doing is obtaining, correlating and evaluating information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our concern is expressed in this context: Throughout a great deal of Australia’s history as a nationcertainly in the postwar period- we have been pre-occupied with the question of so-called <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must reject the whole obsession about <span class="highlight">subversion</span> cultivated over the past two generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One can imagine people who advocate that point of view being caught up within this definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thank the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  and the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  for their contributions because they have demonstrated the reason for the prescence of this word ‘ultimately’ in the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Subversion</span> necessarily being a matter of judgment, as the honourable member for Lilley has pointed out, one cannot limit the judgment of ASIO to conduct presently being committed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the New Zealand security legislation the word ‘ultimately’ is not used in relation to <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are trying to achieve a proper definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United States legislation does not use the word ‘ultimately’ in its definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know of any other country in the world with statutes dealing with <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which has drafted such a clause in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have just been told that if a person advocates a new Constitution for this country or espouses in a peaceful way the establishment of a republic in Australia he will be in conflict with the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simply to advocate a new Constitution does not amount to <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in terms of the three parts of this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not hear about what might constitute <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in those countries and about how their people are denied freedom of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one goes on from that definition as to what is <span class="highlight">subversion</span>- because it relates to security- and then looks at where security comes into the functions of the organisation one sees that Clause 1 7 states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are defining subversive so the community will know what these organisations are about and what we believe constitutes <span class="highlight">subversion</span> so that these organisations can be monitored and our community and our Government will be informed through the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation being able to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word ‘ultimately’ in this context is designed to give the organisation the capacity to be able to monitor those activities, whether the organisation wishes to hide its objective, whether it wants to try to put it aside in some surreptitious way, or whether it wants to indicate in an open way that it preaches <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The  DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr Giles)Before  I call on anyone I remind the Committee that the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  really spoke during the major part of his speech on clause S itself, which is the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> when not of foreign origin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That would leave a definition section of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which states: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are the kinds of activities that active persons with a social conscience and a vision of a better Australia are entitled to be involved in without the brand of suspected <span class="highlight">subversion</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that for the purpose of this argument you would agree that the words of preamble in clause 5(1) have to be read concurrently with clause 5(l)(a)- We have been given no specific example of the kind of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which might legitimately be regarded as being within ASIO’s field. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If in fact ASIO has succeeded in saving this country from <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and revolution in the last 30 years then somebody on the other side ought to be able to get up and timidly squeak out some evidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the information of anybody coming from Mars or anybody who has just turned on his radio I point out what we are actually discussing at the moment is the definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’, which is an extremely difficult matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that are to be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversion</span> are- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It strikes me that most of their remarks have been directed towards attacking the idea of defining ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ in any form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the speech of the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  and the speech of the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  were directed, it seemed to me, against any definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Opposition really want to eliminate any definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He seemed to be asking whether there really was any such thing as <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which could be defined within the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked honourable members on the Government side to give examples of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ is an extraordinarily difficult thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us is particularly happy about having to get down to the rather dreadful business of defining the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, does the act of marching by a person who feels strongly against that law render the citizen who exercises that right subject to the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If one were to have a DirectorGeneral who was a man of small ‘1’ liberal approaches, and he looked at this section on what falls within the definition of subversionand <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is what we are talking aboutbecause the act has to involve or lead to an unlawful act- he could rule that the act of marching was an unlawful act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take the viewand I believe many small ‘1’ liberals would agree with me- that the act of marching by a citizen who wants to protest against a State government which says that he cannot march without a permit, is not the kind of political or social action which ought to attract the operation or the attention of security forces in order to prescribe that citizen as being involved in a possible act of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that those sorts of actions ought to be able to be placed within the context of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> because I do not believe that they are <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, and I do not believe that the DirectorGeneral ought to have to consider whether those actions constitute <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, and they should not be taking up the time and the funds of our security organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask the honourable member for Lalor to stand in this place and tell us of Prince Ruediger von Starhemberg in Vienna, to tell us about Dollfuss and the way he was murdered, to tell us about the ultimate event that took place in Prague, to tell us about  Dr Edward  Benes, Jan Masaryk, and all of those people who were part and parcel of the picture of 50 years of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that if we want to know what members of the Labor Party truly think and what are their emotions about <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, we have to go back beyond the rump that sits in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my mind there is a clear understanding that the Ministry in 1948 and 1949 knew what <span class="highlight">subversion</span> was. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, it was, in fact, a recommendation of  Mr Justice  Hope that the word be used in the juxtaposition of the three fundamental elements of the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> as provided for in clause 5 ( 1 ) (a). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that when one understands those three fundamental elements one can quickly draw the conclusion that the kind of example that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Holding)  was referring to would not come within the meaning of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be borne in mind if one appreciates the three fundamental elements in the meaning of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’, and that is why the word ‘ultimately’ is critical to the authority of ASIO to act in the interests of national security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In debating the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill we are dealing- grappling might be the more appropriate word- with a legal definition of the word ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an attempt to define the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, clause 5 reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key point in the sub-clause is that <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is deemed to exist when the activities are directed towards that purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is attempting to define the activities because they are related to <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When activities have an element of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in them a file is made on those people who are involved in the activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They simply cannot be translated from the industrial context to a definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, those people again could be deemed to be guilty of the act of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me come to the point of what the Opposition is about in regard to this difficult matter of the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because somebody makes a speech urging people not to join the armed forces he should not be deemed to be guilty of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the atmosphere of the times the honourable member for Dundas would have said that was <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and interfering with the defence effort. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would not like to have to sit down and to write a definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> any more than I could of liberty or democracy or any such abstract subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all these matters, the atmosphere of the day could change dramatically so that we could have a totally different view of the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, and the people making the judgments would have totally different views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have embarked upon an almost impossible task to attempt to define <span class="highlight">subversion</span> in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think one can define <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if we are to ask the questions that are implicit in the clause as it is drafted, we have to ask first of all: What is to be regarded as <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we want to equate <span class="highlight">subversion</span> with unlawful activity, that is all right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause at present provides that activities regarded as <span class="highlight">subversion</span> will include:  activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of security or the defence of the Commonwealth; <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us suppose that we changed clause 5 ( 1 ) (b) to say that things to be ‘regarded as <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ include ‘lawful or unlawful activities’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation provided definitions of the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ to the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all accept how difficult it is to express the meaning of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ and to phrase it in a legal form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the report of  Mr Justice  Hope the second definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ is given as overthrow by force and undermining by unlawful means and the definition of ‘subversive activity ‘ is given as overthrow of the Constitution by revolution or sabotage, overthrow by force or violence and destruction of Commonwealth property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It states that it may be fair enough to collect intelligence on the activities of people within trade unions, but I do not think that our amendment conflicts in any way with what  Mr Justice  Hope said about the communication of intelligence about trade unions or with what ASIO said when it put up some definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> to the Royal Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are dealing with the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> it is important not to cast the net so widely that we continually impose upon the Director-General the obligation to involve himself in surveillance activities and in activities related to <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which is a very serious allegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In that situation would we say that those people were guilty of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are talking about a definition of activities that bring a person under notice for <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the Government seriously suggest that because a trade union meeting passes a resolution that it is not going to work a certain ship that therefore is an action directed at causing some <span class="highlight">subversion</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ship may not sail and the people involved in the strike can be penalised, but there is no <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is the most frequent interjector and, I may say, the greatest union basher we have on a clause dealing with <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It happens to have been drafted by somebody who feels that this is the way in which to control <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have spoken about innocent people who can be caught up in the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and have a file prepared on them on that basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To say that such a person was not guilty of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> because the clause requires an illegal act to have been committed is to say something which can only be classified as incompetent and misleading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given that no protection exists in the legislation for a person, given that a person has no defence, I think it is not unreasonable for this clause to contain a provision that before an activity is deemed to be an act of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, before the step of restricting his future civil liberties in this country is taken- it is a severe restriction to establish a file on a person- that person should at least have been charged with or deemed to have undertaken an illegal act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that by implication the thrust of the Minister’s argument is that an activity, in order to fall within the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, has to be primarily directed to obstructing or interfering with the performance of the Defence Force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are dealing with the crime of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said at the beginning, this clause is bad enough, but when I hear these sorts of arguments, I am terrified that anyone ought to have these sorts of powers because what we are dealing with are the rights and liberties of the ordinary Australian citizen and what this clause is dealing with is the crime of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should such a situation occur where those people who have genuine objections to the mining and export of uranium seek to take action to demonstrate that proposition- and the Prime Minister uses his national security powers, as I am sure he would if he thought it was politically advantageous to bring the Army in on a pretext of national security- and picket, demonstrate or in any other way protest against the loading, shipping or movement of that uranium, they will find themselves in breach of the terms of this clause and be deemed to be carrying out acts of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those persons would have been guilty of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> had the Defence Force been brought in either to move that pig iron over the wharves or to protect the movement of that pig iron over the wharves and other activities which were being picketed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no provision for any examination of the files that are created or of their contents and no provision for any person to challenge the existence of a file in his name or to try to establish that the charge of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> which is inherent in the establishment of a file under this clause is a charge which is unwarranted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I fancy that the O ‘Learys do not like the English, but I do not think that has anything to do with <span class="highlight">subversion</span> or with this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any person who takes part in what in fact is <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is entitled to be charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Melbourne Ports also said that this clause deals with the crime of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave- Again relating to the overall definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’, I move: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the present time, in an endeavour to define what is <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, the clause reads: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we are talking about <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, we want to get the definitions right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can try to excuse it to some extent because people get so involved, but we would not dare to suggest that these people are guilty of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">subversion</span> must be directed to a violent act, that is, the overthrow or ruin of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We think that hatred is a phenomenon that we can do without, but it has nothing to do with <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-Clause 5 ( 1 ) (c) attempts to define the meaning of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The clause, in part, defines <span class="highlight">subversion</span> as:  activities directed to promoting violence or hatred between different groups of persons in the Australian community so as to endanger the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is a subjective concept, this Government is obliged to attempt to define the impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Subversion</span> is really not definable because it depends upon the political view in the eye of the beholder. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we are trying here to define the impossible; to define <span class="highlight">subversion</span> is to attempt to define the impossible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is dealing with the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, which is one of the operative words in defining security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This clause in relation to <span class="highlight">subversion</span> refers to activities directed to promoting violence or hatred between different groups of persons in the Australian community so as to endanger- I put emphasis on the word ‘endanger’- the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We cannot just pick out the words that we want to pick out and say that <span class="highlight">subversion</span> comprises activities directed to promoting violence or hatred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge that there may be some difficulty in defining the matter, but Opposition members ought to give credit to the Government for the fact that, rather than just talking about <span class="highlight">subversion</span> and leaving it to somebody else to think about that might be subversive, it has attempted to define it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-We are discussing the third of the definitions of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>- the one which I find the most suspect of the three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three reasons for being cautious about the introduction of hatred as part of the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790920_reps_31_hor115/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I said before the adjournment of the debate that there were three reasons for being cautious about the introduction of ‘promoting hatred’ as part of the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all those honourable members who have been hanging on my words for four weeks, let me explain what are those three reasons for acting with great caution in allowing the words ‘or hatred’ to remain as part of the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to note that  Mr Justice  Hope, in his very comprehensive suggestions for the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’, did not include in that definition the words ‘promoting hatred between different groups of persons in the Australian community’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third reason for asking honourable members to reject this proposal is that by introducing ‘hatred’ into the definition, one moves the definition of ‘<span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ much more clearly into the domestic politics scene than any other of the words used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, all of us and many activists in the community are likely to fall within the definition of <span class="highlight">subversion</span> ‘ in the ordinary spirited political debate that takes place in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the Maginot Line, all defences against anticipated <span class="highlight">subversion</span>, real or imagined, were built on one side. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the justification for these activities we find that the Minister shall not issue a warrant unless he is satisfied that, in the case of clause 25, the premises have recently been occupied or used for activities constituting or in preparation for domestic <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One notes the use of sheer cloudy generalities such as ‘preparation for domestic <span class="highlight">subversion</span>’ likely to engage in activities prejudicial to security’ and ‘reasonably suspected of being engaged in’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>But the ostensible reason for it all is to keep Australia free of <span class="highlight">subversion</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791017_reps_31_hor116/#debate-32">[More…]</a></li>
