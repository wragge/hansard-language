    <p>However, I suggest particularly to the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten)  that the evidence given by that departmental <span class="highlight">representative</span> is very much in keeping with the view of many honourable members on both sides of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720524_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I saw the report of the meeting of 2nd March which the ASIO <span class="highlight">representative</span> had made on 5th March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730403_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The members of the Commonwealth Public Service were cleared of any suspicion of conspiracy by the findings of the relevant heads that there had been a wrong report by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation <span class="highlight">representative</span> at the meeting between him and representatives of other departments on 2nd March. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730412_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the Prime Minister: Is lt a fact, as alleged on the television program ‘Federal File’, that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation <span class="highlight">representative</span> for the interdepartmental meeting on 2nd March is not a public servant? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has the Government deliberately chosen the ASIO <span class="highlight">representative</span> as the most convenient scapegoat to hide the Government’s own duplicity in this affair? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730411_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also agree with the honourable member that it would be sound practice for a government <span class="highlight">representative</span> to accompany that delegation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730501_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why was the Australian Council of Trade Unions the only organisation with an interest in the work of the National Commission on Social Welfare given the right to nominate a <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730502_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-42-12">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to define what is ‘adequate representation’ unless one knew the number of persons who constituted the various boards, commissions, trusts, etc., but on  a  board of, say,  3  members, the appointment of one trade union <span class="highlight">representative</span> may be considered adequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730503_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-39-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably there was no action previously because the former Government did not have a Queensland <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Qantas board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would draw the honourable member’s attention to the fact that before this system was introduced it was discussed by me personally with the relevant ministers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia and more latterly in Thailand and also with the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of Fiji here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740319_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Do we leave this unsatisfactory situation as the apologia at all levels for defects in government performance or do we show the same drive and imagination that led the fathers of our Constitution to hold their great, and for those days <span class="highlight">representative</span>, conventions, to find common grounds for the alterations that are needed? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700305_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the honourable member will know, late in 1968 I appointed a panel, <span class="highlight">representative</span> of Australian growers, processors and the Government, to most with a similar panel of New Zealanders to study the impact of exchanges of peas and beans across the Tasman and to reach understandings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To carry it further, are we not to sit if there is a meeting of a group of people which a member of the Country Party, or the Liberal Party or the Labor Party wishes to attend because he feels it more important to formulate their will than to come here as the elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> and express their will? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No, but I had a very good <span class="highlight">representative</span> there, one of your side who always tells me what happens when anything goes against the Prime Minister, oddly enough, and he told me that he is ready to cross the floor and vote against the Prime Minister on this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Contrary to what they would say, the reason is that it would appear to me to be inappropriate to include such representatives when we are only establishing a specialist register purely for the purposes of the National Health Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700513_reps_27_hor67/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members may have noticed that clause 16 of the Bill provides that 2 members of the consultative committee shall be representatives of the engineering profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clause does not state that the consultative committee must consist of 2 members who are professional engineers; it states that it must consist of 2 members who are representatives of the engineering profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nowhere in the clause is it suggested who the representatives on that committee will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In New South Wales with 2,468,181 electors there are 45 members of the House of Representatives and 10 senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, 1 Federal <span class="highlight">representative</span> for each 44,876 electors on an average. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there were 2 senators each for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in addition to the present member of the House of Representatives for each such Territory, the proportion of representatives to electoral population on the latest enrolment figures would be 1 to 21,795 in the Australian Capital Territory and 1 to 7,651 in the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition is of the opinion that if the <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this House of the Northern Territory has these qualities they are exceedingly well hidden. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory speaks for the first time in this House in a few moments honourable members will see how knowledgeable the people of the Australian Capital Territory were about the qualities of their <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it will enable the electors of the Northern Territory to judge whether their <span class="highlight">representative</span> is capable of doing the job himself, which, as all honourable members know, is open to grave doubts, or whether he needs assistance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is not because there has been an Australian Capital Territory <span class="highlight">representative</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the other place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Territory ordinances are to be debated properly in the Senate then the people of the Australian Capital Territory and of the Northern Territory must have representatives there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must have representatives whom they can ring and to whom they can say: ‘Look, this is wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the moment there is no <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On matters of defence it would want its <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the Senate to be heard, lt has no <span class="highlight">representative</span> there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My third reason is that, having listened to the excellent advocacy of the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Austraiian Capital Territory, I wish to speak on behalf of the people of the Northern Territory if the honourable member for the Northern Territory will not speak for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has refused to rise in his place and say a few words such as those he uttered from his electoral platform about a matter which affects the people of the Northern Territory who elected him to sit as their <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe it is reasonable to assume that the services will be much more <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Department as a whole in its origins and education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They recognised that all these things were happening and that, above all, the situation had arisen where there was, on the one hand, the Prime Minister - a charismatic man like Pierre Trudeau - and, on the other band, the public at large and the Parliament, which used to be the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people - this intermediary - was ceasing to matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, when, a year ago, the International Grains Arrangement was close to failure in providing stability of competition in wheat in world markets, the Community was the only exporter member which sent a <span class="highlight">representative</span> to a conference without any authority to enter into commitments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we have done, of course, is to allow the party system to prevail over the common sense, ethics or legality of <span class="highlight">representative</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A  man cannot be a part time <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this Parliament, and no-one can be a part time <span class="highlight">representative</span> in any other parliament, if he is to do his job effectively. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The New South Wales Assembly requires a 21% quorum; the Ceylon House of <span class="highlight">Representative</span>, 13%; the South African Assembly, 18%; the Canadian House of Commons, 7i%; the Indian Parliament, 10%; and the House of Commons, which has been quoted so often in this debate, 6i%. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700820_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently an Australian <span class="highlight">representative</span> has visited at frequent intervals in order to see whether he has been properly treated, whether he has any complaints to make and whether we can do anything to ensure that his conditions are better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There would seem to me to emerge the need for a body that would be more widely <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the whole community to view and review, particularly upon submission from a significant group of people, a certain period of programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw your attention,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a rural electorate, to the discussions that took place here about 12 months ago when the Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement was introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700825_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, it is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the kind of restrictions which are applied in various parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#debate-18">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Through an expansion of stream gauging and the use of a series of <span class="highlight">representative</span> river basins as models for the whole of the continent, the various governments concerned are building up a more detailed assessment of water resources as a basis for future planning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700828_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Subsequently a  Mr Hibble  who is, I understand, both the secretary of the Liberal Party conference for the area and also the deputies and shot firers <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Trades and Labour Council, arranged for the calling of this meeting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700901_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister for Trade and Industry also has agreed that a trade <span class="highlight">representative</span> will be appointed and I take it that it will not be long before action is taken administratively to ensure that someone is appointed there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700902_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is within the Restrictive Trade Practices Act certain power given to the Minister for Trade and Industry to ensure that negotiations are undertaken between the shipping conferences, represented in Australia by a body known as the Oversea Shipping Representatives Association and a shipper body known here as the Australia to Europe Shippers Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700903_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your Committee is further pleased to note that a Treasury <span class="highlight">representative</span>, in addition to the Commonwealth Statistician, now attends all meetings of the inter-departmental committee on automatic data processing and that progress has been made in amending the Audit Act and Treasury regulations to remove legal impediments to the efficient introduction and operation of automatic data processing systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700915_reps_27_hor69/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps when the trees in the Murrumbidgee area get a little older and the oranges a little rougher - and, indeed, when their Federal <span class="highlight">representative</span> gets a little rougher - they might improve out of all knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700923_reps_27_hor69/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did any discussions take place at the recent conference between the Commonwealth, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Employers Policy Committee as to whether an accredited job <span class="highlight">representative</span> should be granted the necessary time off without loss of pay to (a) attend the enrolment of employees eligible to become members of his union (b) communicate with the full-time officials of his organisation whenever such communication becomes necessary during working hours (c) discuss grievances with fellow employees on the job during working hours and (d) communicate and discuss complaints with management during working hours. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it essential that an accredited job <span class="highlight">representative</span> should be free to state fearlessly the views and grievances of those whom he represents without even the slightest possibility of suffering victimisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-52">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, will he consider amending the Act in such a way as to prohibit the dismissal of an accredited job <span class="highlight">representative</span> for any reason which may be related to his union position, with the provision that where a dismissal of a job <span class="highlight">representative</span> takes place, the onus should be on the employer to prove that the dismissal was not directly or indirectly due to his activities as a job <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-21-52">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If so, does the Australian <span class="highlight">representative</span> at those talks agree with this assessment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Sturt referred, if my memory serves me correctly, to a statement made by a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the building trade in South Australia, who said that the figures in that State were below the 1961 figures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The type of committee that would be set up that way, widely <span class="highlight">representative</span>, uncommitted, with first hand knowledge of the scheme, would have been well qualified to bring down a report that would have been invaluable to the Minister and the Government, whatever its political colour; on which the future programme of migration might be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In such discussions it is natural that the Administration will invite-: not only members of the Council and Mataungan Association, but representatives of other interested parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700930_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Assuming that from 1st January 1972 the figure of 26,000 females employed in equal pay categories is a <span class="highlight">representative</span> figure, and that all of these females are in receipt of adult rates of pay, the maximum annual cost of the equal pay decision in a full year would be in the vicinity of $11m. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701013_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-38-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the first principles of management is that there should be proper lines of communication and I suggest that all the evidence in front of a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people, such as  myself, is that  such a structure does not exist in the key Prime Minister’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701020_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, the Government, having made its decision to go ahead with this legislation when it first came before this House, should not have succumbed to the political blackmail of the Democratic Labor Party in the Senate, whose main objective was to preserve the political life of the DLP <span class="highlight">representative</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701021_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The report and recommendations of the Advisory Committee of the Wool Board were presented to the Government by representatives of the industry in July of this year The Government decided that it would be desirable to have an independent assessment made of the proposal by a highly qualified person who could also fill in the details of the broad principles recommended by the Advisory Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The composition of the Australian Wool Commission is dealt with in Part II of the Bill, lt is proposed that the Commission should consist of 7 members comprising a  Chairman,  2 members to represent Australian wool growers, a Commonwealth government <span class="highlight">representative</span> who would be drawn from the Public Service, and 3 other members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To this end the following provisions are included in the Bill in respect of the reserve price and re-selling policies of the Commission: A government <span class="highlight">representative</span> is to be on the Commission; the government is to have the right to appoint the  Chairman  and the  Deputy Chairman  of the Commission; the Commission is to report fortnightly to the Minister for Primary Industry and the Treasurer on its reserve prices, on wool purchased and held by it, as well as sales of wool made and proposed offerings; the government is to have the right to issue directions to the Commission on its reserve price and reselling operations when this is considered necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701027_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The University Council also recommended a further undergraduate <span class="highlight">representative</span>, but the Government believes that having regard to the nature and composition of the Council and its methods of operation, the measures it proposes will provide adequate representation for undergraduate students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The qualifying conditions of Council membership are being varied by removing the requirements: (a) that the undergraduates’ <span class="highlight">representative</span> be a graduate of a university; and (b) that the research students’ <span class="highlight">representative</span> be a graduate of a university of at least 2 years standing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Also amongst the people who came to this country and who have been buying a lot of wool from Australia were representatives of Japan Wool Textiles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Being ‘all for Australia’ I called in a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of one of our largest manufacturers of textiles and an offshoot of an overseas textile company and asked him to bring us the full range of woolen fabrics suitable for exclusive women’s wear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On asking the <span class="highlight">representative</span> why this firm still carried a range of colours of die 1920s which lacked the subtlety of the soft colours and the excitement of the glorious sharp colours the overseas mills were able to produce, I was told ‘Well, we can sell all we need in this range so why should we bother our heads to change?’! <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the remainder of his speech, the United States <span class="highlight">representative</span> referred, inter alia, to the United States attitude to nations divided against their will, noting that his Government would continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections, and to its traditional position that peoples were entitled to determine their own future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the interest shown in the speech, I include here the full text of what the United States <span class="highlight">representative</span>, Under Secretary of State, General Walter Bedell Smith, said at the concluding Indo-China plenary session at Geneva on 21st July 1954: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the statement made by the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the State of Viet-Nam, the United States reiterates its traditional position that peoples are entitled to determine their own future and that it will not join in an arrangement which would hinder this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-36-8">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr H. Gullett, the association’s Canberra <span class="highlight">representative</span>, said such a price fall had been ‘precisely what had happened’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-37-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose one might as well note the new trend which is now developing within universities for the students not to want separate student representation but for them to want the whole university to be regarded as one corporate body and for the students to be electing the staff representatives in conjunction with the staff and the staff to be electing the student representatives in conjunction with the students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is a new trend within the National Union of Australian University Students and within student <span class="highlight">representative</span> councils. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That, to me, can be done by one person - the  president  of the students <span class="highlight">representative</span> council or whatever the equivalent may be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps you might like to shore him up to some extent and have a second <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is of course true to say that it would perhaps be given more direct attention and more direct interest would be created in the 2 chambers of this Parliament if they were represented specifically on the council and of course it may also be true that, if there were direct representatives from the community of the Australian Capital Territory as such on that body, again this might be a further advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time one would imagine that all those people at present provided for will see themselves as members of the ACT community and there may be a very fine line indeed in deciding who in fact is the more <span class="highlight">representative</span> type of person coming out of the ACT on to the governing body of the Canberra College of Advanced Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the Sydney University has on its controlling body 10 representatives of the graduates, 3 of the fellows, the Vice-Chancellor of the time, 5 representatives of the teaching staff, 1 <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the undergraduates, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the Swinburne College of Technology, which is a very high-powered institution, does not have student representatives on the College council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House ask the Government to go one step further and encourage this trend so that greater fulfilment and greater representation can be achieved between the colleges and outside bodies, members of Parliament, and indeed <span class="highlight">representative</span> interests in the community - commerce, industry, staff, scholastic bodies and other interested bodies - so there can be this interchange of ideas that we have traditionally tended to associate with universities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Of the seven only one is a departmental <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If this amendment were adopted it would mean that there would be an election to be prescribed by regulation and conducted presumably amongst the general body of electors in Canberra to select these 3 representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is also  Dr Waterhouse  who is the <span class="highlight">representative</span> from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and who again is well known in that particular sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The people of Canberra would not recognise professors, with all due respect, as being typical or <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yet, another reason or reasons have been found not to accept representatives of the local community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister was concerned about the cost that would be involved in electing community representatives to the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, the election of community representatives to the Council could be run in conjunction with the election of members to the Canberra Community Hospital Board or the Advisory Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are suggesting that community representatives should be members of the Council because they would enrich the advice that would be coming to that body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701029_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the year my son was the only <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Senate of the University of Western Australia but the number being enlarged to 3 has improved the situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are a number of student representatives it tends to prevent a breakdown of communication between the governing body of the university and the student body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, it has made certain changes to the structure of the Council in that the undergraduate <span class="highlight">representative</span> no longer has to be a graduate of the university. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is more, the research students’ <span class="highlight">representative</span> does not have to be a graduate of 2 years standing and the age of the student <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Council has been reduced to make it realistic that he should be an undergraduate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it would be a very good thing if the Council of the Australian National University had a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of external students on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, the Council had been most impressed over the years with the excellent contributions made to Council discussion by the student representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These single representatives have had an increasingly difficult task to perform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out that since the student <span class="highlight">representative</span> has been  on the  Council student numbers have more than trebled, with a similar proliferation of the clubs, societies and sporting bodies which he alone represents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the increasing burden being placed on the student <span class="highlight">representative</span> and because the Students Association felt it should have a voice, some years ago the Council invited the  President  of the Students Association to attend Council meetings and to speak if necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly an additional student <span class="highlight">representative</span> would not alter unduly the balance nor would it lead to a student takeover. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn fact, quite frequently Council changes its view in the light of representations properly made and properly argued by student representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be remembered that the person holding the position of  President  of the Students Association is, in fact, elected to that position, so in one sense the elected student <span class="highlight">representative</span> membership has been increased to two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of them are active members of political institutions yet, in respect of the simple issue of their having some effective say and representation on the bodies which control their own future, they are not to be trusted with more than one <span class="highlight">representative</span> in 30 or 40. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Flinders University will have 1 <span class="highlight">representative</span> - a big advance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other universities such as New England, New South Wales and so on have single representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>said earlier that Australia has been more conservative in this aspect than have <span class="highlight">representative</span> bodies overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, a couple of representatives of the nature proposed in the legislation is almost non-existent representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, participation in a <span class="highlight">representative</span> capacity is more than just where it fits into the academic scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They enable that Council officially, formally and with due writing to transmit through the student body <span class="highlight">representative</span> or representatives the reasons for certain decisions being taken and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has not been any suggestion either in this legislation or by the people who so far have spoken to the Bill that any attempt should be made to have the student body in such a situation that its representatives were remotely in a position to out-vote for example the professorial nominated members, the GovernorGeneral’s nominees, the Convocation’s nominees and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The acceptance of an extra undergraduate <span class="highlight">representative</span> in no way would have made any difference to that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tn fact, it could be said that the views of the students would be represented adequately by, let us say, the  president  of their <span class="highlight">representative</span> council or whatever it is called. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It therefore seems to me that much the more important additions really in terms of practical academics is the adding of sub-professorial representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no case to answer about having any very substantial student representation, although it would have been a nice sop or, even better than that, perhaps a nice acquiescence if in fact the Government or the Minister had not seen fit to drop one undergraduate <span class="highlight">representative</span> from the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether the honourable member for Denison had in his mind some picture that with one more student <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Council the numbers would be completely the way of the students. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt is true that there are 2 universities which have 2 student representatives on their governing bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that one honourable member suggested that La Trobe University had 4 undergraduate representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we are not including the graduate <span class="highlight">representative</span> in our discussion of the Australian National University the comparison is 3 as against 2. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the picture in Australia and I think that this amendment to the Act in fact very greatly liberalises the position in the Australian National University, not only in increasing the number of student representatives from 1 to 2 but also in reducing the age from 21 years to 18 years, in providing that graduates do not have to be of 2. years standing but may be elected immediately on graduation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Department of Shipping and Transport surveyor from Fremantle further inspected the vessel and endorsed the decision of the Bunbury harbourmaster that the repairs should be effected under the supervision of the American Bureau of Shipping, whose local <span class="highlight">representative</span> subsequently issued a report to the effect that these repairs had been effected, confirming the view of his counterpart in South Australia that the ship be allowed to carry cargo provided that it was surveyed within 60 days of the date of the South Australian inspection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710909_reps_27_hor73/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At this time when the postal delivery is by reason of costs getting worse and worse, when only one delivery a day is being made and when businessmen are receiving their mail too late in the day, these further methods by which postal deliveries will start from a distance rather than from post offices close to the points of delivery, are an extreme worry to people in my electorate and, indeed, to me as their <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710913_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, you have spoken in this debate as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the electorate of Maranoa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the <span class="highlight">representative</span> function, the executive function, the legislative function and the function which might be described as the scrutiny and surveillance of public activities in the general community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">representative</span> function, which concerns us all, is I think the reason why we must protect the right to hear what the citizenry has to say, to speak about it in this chamber and to place it before the appropriate authorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hold the view that the people in the electorate of Wills have the right to some say in the executive direction of the nation in the same way as the people in the electorate of Lowe have through their <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So while I make no brief whatsoever for our failing to attempt to eradicate the imperfections of this system in which there are many, I believe that we should be eternally cognisant of the fact that we have here one of the most <span class="highlight">representative</span> democracies in the world today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our respective constituencies we are being assailed by the public and <span class="highlight">representative</span> education organisations, parents and citizens associations, pensioners, people who are interested in hospitalisation and people who bitterly resent the swingeing increases in taxation which are being imposed on them by the State governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711006_reps_27_hor74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a normal procedure in estimates debates for the Minister in charge of the particular department or his <span class="highlight">representative</span> to answer any queries, suggestions or criticisms offered by honourable members during the course of the debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the responsible <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the nation, this Government cannot afford to allow matters simply to take their course. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711007_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, one of the chief objects of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to encourage the formation of <span class="highlight">representative</span> employer and employee bodies and their registration under that Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same time in a Press report in answer to my criticism of the delay in starting work on the Mount Gravatt university my predecessor in this House - a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Liberal Party - said that the delay in starting work on this university was caused by the State Government requesting the Commonwealth Government to hold off the availability of funds for Mount Gravatt because State matching funds were not available to proceed with its development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a large wool growing electorate - and no doubt most honourable members know and appreciate the point that I am a grower myself - I have, like a lot of other honourable members, devoted quite a deal of my time to trying to find the solution or answer to some of the questions which have been raised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A company <span class="highlight">representative</span> took the insurance assessor to the hospital to interview the injured man and offered to show him in the Facility’s town office an item of furniture identical to the one which was claimed to be a factor in the injury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711014_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-45-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I stand here and speak as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> as such, not representing any particular party or person in this instance and not particularly representing the electorate of Wills but, I hope, responding to all those people - the countless thousands in this country - who have demanded that we do something. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711026_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In April 1970, only weeks after the referendum was held, a delegation from the Australian Dried Fruits Control Board including a senior officer from my Department who is the government <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Board, rushed to London at very short notice for an emergency meeting of the parties to the International Sultana (Raisin) Agreement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The type of committee that would be set up that way, widely <span class="highlight">representative</span>, uncommitted, with first hand knowledge of the scheme, would have been well qualified to bring down a report that would have been invaluable to the Minister and the Government, whatever its political colour; on which the future programme of migration might be based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711028_reps_27_hor74/#debate-52">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would consider that I would be failing in my duty as a South Australian <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this Parliament if I once again did not take the opportunity, which was earlier denied me, to condemn the Government for its shortsightedness and its almost inhuman act in introducing this Bill, the provisions of which are tantamount to saying to the companies which will be effected: ‘You have served our purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My personal belief is that we must try to produce a system in which the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people of Wills has some say in the executive authority of the nation in the same way as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people of Lowe has. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711104_reps_27_hor74/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have the almost incomprehensible position where recently a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Government in the United States virtually chided the American Government because of the liberal policy it was pursuing on the question of China, and he was virtually telling the United States Government that American policy on China must change if the United States wanted the Liberal Party to be preserved in power in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is establishing himself not as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the bulk of the people in his electorate but as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a small, militant section which is itself not even <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711109_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps this matter would more appropriately bc raised when discussing the estimates of the Department of Trade and Industry, but I would like to say that our trade <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the office of the High Commissioner at Nairobi handles trade matters for the whole of Africa, apart from white South Africa and Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711110_reps_27_hor75/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To defend the United States against a Chinese Communist accusation on these lines, in a statement before the Security Council on 25th August 1950 the American <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the United Nations, Ernest Gross, reversed his country’s policy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same Press conference, however, he noted the opposing contentions of the Communists and the Nationalists to be the sole government of China and <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people of China and stated that representation in the international organisation need not prejudice the claims or views of either government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711111_reps_27_hor75/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order that we might be able to utilise the money that has been made available by the Commonwealth I ask the Minister for his assistance and the assistance of his Department in sending departmental officers to the electorate of Robertson so that they may sit down and have a talk with the Slate Parliamentary <span class="highlight">representative</span>, the members of the Gosford and Wyong shire councils, the members of the community service clubs and also the pensioner and senior citizens organisations, so that we can get a programme under way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As far as the whole structure of representatives, open electorates, and regional electorates and so on is concerned, the most minor of these categories gives me some little concern - it is only little - and that is the provision for special groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Beyond that, as the honourable member will be aware, al the conclusion of a meeting of the National Labour Advisory Council on 21st April 1971, a statement was issued recording agreement between employer and ACTU members that <span class="highlight">representative</span> tripartite discussion concerning the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should begin as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720222_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-32-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Likewise, the resort of the Prime Minister to the Embassy for counselling and advice on what he should do with regard to Vorster’s racism illustrates all too clearly that the foreign policy of Australia on this vital ma’ter was decided not by the Australian Government but by the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Vorster regime in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720224_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coming back to the points that we have made in this debate, the provision of an advisory council to assist the Commission to be <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the community and of educational research bodies is an important consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet all the Minister can do is to stand up in this House and say: ‘I am right to exclude the teacher representatives from having any say in the control of this scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat: One Commissioner, no teaching representatives, no representatives from educational research fields, no representatives from the public and the Commission to be answerable to the Public Service Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps it is not totally convincing but the argument is that in current circumstances and in view of the nature of the job to be done the commissioner will with a small staff be responsible for the whole operation; that it is a small system and it is not appropriate at this stage at least to have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> commission, in other words, to overload the apple cart and to have a heavy administrative structure to administer something which at the moment is specifically a teaching service operating for a relatively small number of teachers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been strongly recommended that perhaps there ought to be a teachers’ <span class="highlight">representative</span> on a promotions committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On that board there will be one elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the teachers, one <span class="highlight">representative</span> nominated by the Commissioner and an independent  chairman  appointed by the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This means that there will be 2 boss’s men on the promotions appeal board as against one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neither Board has an independent chairman with the consequence that the teachers’ <span class="highlight">representative</span> has always to face the Government nominees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently there is every need for 3 commissioners of which one is a teacher <span class="highlight">representative</span> and for an advisory council to act with the Commissioner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I heard various honourable members talking about disciplinary action but, after all, the teachers will elect a <span class="highlight">representative</span> to the Disciplinary Appeal Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720322_reps_27_hor76/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister for Primary Industry really believe that the AWIC is truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the wool growing industry? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are fully entitled to it and they are eligible so let us not have the type of argument that we cannot get a sufficiently <span class="highlight">representative</span> poll or that we would not know which wool growers should vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 am deeply concerned, as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of many fine and basic studs, that in recent years, as a result of the Government’s sponsored rural recession, the studs have been in a situation which has been increasingly difficult. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is true - it is said that truth will come out, and it has come out this time - is that the honourable member for Hunter knowing that the Australian Country Party is the chief <span class="highlight">representative</span> of people in far flung areas and people on the land- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was suggested, of course, that the education commission would be <span class="highlight">representative</span> of teachers themselves, the practitioners in the field; that it would have represented on it also parent organisations and various other interested community organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi)  put his finger right on the matter when he said that in this Bill the Government has failed to provide the kind of control that ought to be provided, namely, that there should be 3 commissioners one of whom would represent the teaching service thus giving teachers a professional dignity and democratic participation in the service in which they work, one representating other interested sections of the community, and a third <span class="highlight">representative</span> appointed by the Minister for Education and Science or the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TheBoard shall also consist of a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the union and a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Commonwealth Teaching Service who could well be somebody from the authority itself - somebody who has direct concern with the school situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The principal objective of the amendments is to allow for changes in the method of appointing industry representatives to the Australian Honey Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The machinery measures envisaged in the amendments purport to make the Honey Board more effective and more <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the honey industry in Australia, with a minimum of frustration in the operation of the Board itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The 5 producer representatives are to be from the mainland States, and the 4 packer represents also are to be from the mainland States other than Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that if one looks at the 3 arguments advanced by some State apiarists associations and by some beekeepers that no packers should be represented on the Board one finds that they are nowhere near as strong as those advanced for why there should be representatives of the marketing experts on the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is right that I should rise in this debate as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the sweetest State in the nation, if we take honey as a criterion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, there are one or two queries that should be put tonight to the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We find that there are 5 producer members, 4 packer representatives and one member nominated by the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Commonwealth nominates a packer it means that there are 5 packer representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past most producer nominees were selected by a State executive committee to be on the Honey Board as a producer <span class="highlight">representative</span>, but in some States they were elected by the majority vote of the annual conference of the State association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the time when the Honey Board was established it was decided by all concerned, including the Government and the Department of Primary Industry, that Tasmania would have no <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Board, that producers in that State would be levied in the same way as apiarists on the mainland, but that the levy collected in Tasmania would be returned to that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand that the amendments to the Act will allow alterations to the manner in which the beekeeper representatives or the apiarists representatives are elected to the Honey Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand the position, the changed manner of election should overcome the problems associated with selecting the best people from those States that are entitled to have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The claim that a producer’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> is a managing director of one of the largest packing and exporting companies is to me not a particularly good and encouraging thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720329_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The current concentrations of plutonium 238 in the Australian environment, which are generally <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the southern hemisphere are between one ten thousandth and one thousandth of the International Commission on Radiological Protection levels and can in no way be considered a hazard to health. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>His  amendment prompted South Australian representatives in this Parliament to enter the debate and subsequently the Leader of the Opposition in the South Australian Parliament saw the opportunity of fostering the idea that Chowilla as the site for a dam was gone for good and that only the Dartmouth dam would be built. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He is a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of that State in this Parliament and is entitled to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720413_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that very occasionally they may have up to several thousand, but more often then not in present times when these chain petitions are operating, petitions formally organised by particular bodies in the community - perhaps they are no less <span class="highlight">representative</span> for that reason but they are nevertheless organised, as against voluntarily organised petitions emanating from the will of the public and untutored by any other element in the community - the average number may well be nearer 10 or 100 than a thousand, although I do not know. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposition is that these petitions, formidable though they might be, <span class="highlight">representative</span> though they might be of the average electors or of some electors, should take their rightful place in the affairs of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Take the western suburbs of Altona, Williamstown, Footscray, Sunshine and Keilor whose  1968  population was  227,000  and then take as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> eastern suburbs block, Camberwell, Hawthorn, Kew and Malvern whose  1968  population figure was  220,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720509_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once again, however, I must make the point that no matter whether it be a full-time official or a job <span class="highlight">representative</span>, the person who speaks for the union must not have the reputation of being a ‘boss’s man’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720510_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to make this suggestion: I believe that a commission, perhaps a royal commission, of the highest possible competence, spread right across the board, <span class="highlight">representative</span> of employer organisations, the trade union movement and all interests should be established to examine the whole structure of conciliation and arbitration in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The point is whether the honourable member can carry out his responsibilities to the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety, The House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory as well as his responsibilities as chief Government Whip and go overseas as the Prime Minister’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> to an environment conference in Vienna in the near future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will refer to an article published in the issue of 20th October 1971 where, similarly,  Mr Justice  Aird in relation to a flow-on case from the metal trades award heard in July and August of last year was trying to pin down the Government’s <span class="highlight">representative</span>, a  Mr Marks,  Q.C, as to exactly what his submission was and how it compared with prior submissions by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On several occasions I have been involved in such situations where the union, having failed to reach a satisfactory agreement with the employer, has served a log of claims which in turn has been passed on to the employers’ federation, as the employers’ <span class="highlight">representative</span>, to handle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The representatives of the employers would give a little and the representatives of the employees would do likewise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if he refuses to attend because the members of his union have said that there is no point in trying to achieve a compromise on a particular issue that person - the trade union secretary or a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the union - would immediately be penalised $1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If you accept the principle of having compulsory conferences and giving to a conciliation commissioner the power to call a compulsory conference, surely we must give the commissioner the right to say: ‘I want such and such an organisation here or the <span class="highlight">representative</span> who has been intimately concerned with this matter and I want  Mr So-and-so  who is the  president  or the secretary of a particular union.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does it follow that where 2 <span class="highlight">representative</span> interests - employer and employee - who have struck a bargain, who have reached an agreement and have had someone else, either a commissioner or some outside intervener, come along and say that it is not in the public interest that these people should be allowed to give expression to their agreement, the right of appeal should be restricted to one of the parties? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The latest and perhaps most glaring example of that is that some 2 or 3 years ago the court agreed with a submission by  Mr Robinson,  who was the employers <span class="highlight">representative</span> at that time, that the national economy, which was being ostensibly considered then, would be better off with a national wage and that there should be no longer the structure which we knew and which seemed to serve the purpose so well of a basic wage and a margin for skill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720516_reps_27_hor78/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps the greatest honour which can come to anyone in a parliamentary democracy is to act as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of his or her fellow citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been my pleasure to speak to this motion for the adoption of the AddressinReply as a forerunner of my contributions to this House as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Country Party and the electors of McMillan, who have given me the honour of speaking on their behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In applying myself to the task of being an effective member of Federal Parliament and a worthy <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Holt electorate, I am grateful for the confidence shown in me by those responsible for my election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Holt is in fact so clearly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of Australian life in its economy and sociology that the sorts of things I believe are necessary in my electorate are those things for which the entire Commonwealth seeks progress and direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is fitting that in the Speech, the Governor-General, as the Queen’s <span class="highlight">representative</span>, should echo the words of Prince Phillip when His Highness, as President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said that the Lake Pedder case marked the end of Australia’s pioneering days and ushered in a new phase of conscious concern for the long term future of our national and human environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A national identity and the national co-operation of all the peoples of a country which has such a great and abiding future can be forged and achieved once it is acknowledged that within the Australian federation States and their governments are a system of <span class="highlight">representative</span> regional government as capable of discerning and expressing the regional will of its people as this Government claims for itself over the national will of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have embarked upon a program of establishing a <span class="highlight">representative</span> body based upon an electoral system to be designed by themselves so that it will be, in effect, the continuing consultative body to the Government and particularly to the Minister who, for the time being, is myself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fourth main purpose is to correct an existing anomaly in the war service homes legislation by providing for the extension of eligibility to certain persons who served overseas with the Australian forces in the 1939-45 War or in the subsequent war-like operations as an accredited <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a welfare organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1966 1 was elected to this House as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of an electorate which, although called Sturt, was substantially different from the electorate which 1 now represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730307_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This we believe is a basic abrogation of the Government’s probity and integrity as the sovereign and elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The union <span class="highlight">representative</span> said he will go to the Minister and say that the relationships are bad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There could be some employers, and I emphasise some employers, who for some reason that they did not quite understand were not getting the government contracts awarded which they felt they ought to be getting because they knew their prices and quality were good and they knew they had had contracts in the past, who would wonder whether it might not be a good idea to approach not a Minister, not a public servant, but some <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Labor Party in their area and say: Look, try to find out what is wrong here, would you? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A legal personal <span class="highlight">representative</span> should be allowed this right, and this is the purpose of clause 5 of the Bill, as the Minister stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Only last week in Parliament House after Parliament was opened by  His Excellency  the Governor-General, who is the Queen’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> in Australia, honourable members were invited to meet him and pay their respects to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I respect their views but I still believe that even though they hold those views sincerely, it still would have been courteous to acknowledge the Queen’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> while she remains Queen of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps it was also indicative of the newer breed of Labor men that a number of its members were reported by the Press to have refused to shake the hand of the Governor-General, a former colleague and the Queen’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this country- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The platform is a public document, resulting from debate at open conferences which are <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the tens of thousands of Australians who make up the Australian Labor Party, and which anyone who subscribes to the Party’s principles can join, and join in that decision-making process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730308_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Perhaps his <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this House or the Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry  (Dr J. F.

    <p>It is also relevant to point out that preferential voting such as we have in the House of Representatives is known, according to the National Library, in only 2 other countries, Iran and South Korea - and in those countries there is not compulsory voting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730315_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What honourable gentlemen who have suggested such things do not understand is that during the 23 years of government of the Liberal-Country Party coalition and almost since Federation and the existence of industrial legislation in Australia, one of the principal objects of that legislation, both State and Federal, has been the encouragement of the formation of <span class="highlight">representative</span> bodies of employees and employers, and their registration pursuant to the provisions of those acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Without the existence of strong, vigorous and responsible trade unions in this country the concept of conciliation and arbitration cannot exist, industrial tribunals in Australia throughout this century and authorities on industrial regulation throughout the free world have recognised that there cannot be a system of responsible and legitimate industrial regulation unless there exist responsible, vigorous, strong and <span class="highlight">representative</span> trade union organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730328_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The seat of Macquarie, which just by coincidence happens to berepresented by a Labor member, was thought not to need the same facilities  for  a <span class="highlight">representative</span> to enable him to attend to the needs of a far spread out electorate, an electorate which because of its terrain is extremely difficult to traverse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730329_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is conceivable that the report which the ASIO <span class="highlight">representative</span> made and which I quoted was inaccurate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is possible that the ASIO <span class="highlight">representative</span> misunderstood or misinterpreted what was said by the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Attorney-General’s Department and/ or what was said by the representatives of the Foreign Affairs Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if the report was not an accurate one or if it is the case that an ASIO <span class="highlight">representative</span> misunderstood or misinterpreted the proceedings at the meeting, there is also a great deal of concern, surely, not only among members of the Parliament but also among members of the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Since there were only a small group present on 2nd March at the departmental and agencies meeting which was allegedly plotting against the Government, why has it taken more than 2 weeks to ascertain whether or not a one-sentence report of a single decision recorded by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation <span class="highlight">representative</span> was accurate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Not only must this Parliament be <span class="highlight">representative</span> by observing equal electorate representation so that urban, country and fringe areas are represented equally, and so that socioeconomic groupings are represented equally, but it must guarantee that as far as practicable one man’s vote is equal to the vote of any other man, no matter where he lives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730404_reps_28_hor83/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The inquiries show that the ASIO <span class="highlight">representative</span> gave, in what was admittedly an internal minute, a wrong report of what was said by the officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and that as a consequence he wrongly represented the remarks of officers of the AttorneyGeneral’s Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730405_reps_28_hor83/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The investigatory committee consisted of officers of the Treasury, members of the Superannuation Board, the Government Actuary and, if my memory is correct, a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Public Service Board was later added to the committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730515_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One other point I would like to make is that, in line with the Labor policy of jobs for the boys, provision is to be made for a trade union <span class="highlight">representative</span> to be one of the 5 members of the Authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Very few people will be working on the pipeline after it is completed; so why have a trade union <span class="highlight">representative</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason I believe that the Secretary should not be the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Department of Minerals and Energy, but that some other civil servant within that Department should be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those 3, one is to be a trade union <span class="highlight">representative</span> and one is to be the secretary of the Department of Minerals and Energy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730516_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1  mention, firstly, the need in a <span class="highlight">representative</span> parliamentary democracy of this character, which this Parliament represents in Australia, to keep it the major forum for political debate and discussion in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For that reason and because these are windfalls, I say that all Australians have an equal right and I, as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of an electorate in New South Wales want to put forward the rights of the people in my electorate and the rights of the people of New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At a meeting held last Monday the steering committee agreed to recommend to the convention that local government be given direct representation consisting of 3 representatives from each State, 2 from the Northern Territory and one from the Australian Capital Territory and that representatives from each State should include one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the capital of the State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The steering committee decided further that the representatives be nominated by local government, but that the method of selecting the 3 representatives from local government in each State would be left to the parliamentary delegation from that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point was that the parliamentary delegates from each State should decide who to ask to select the representatives of local government, not that the parliamentary delegates themselves would choose those representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The State member’s charge against me cannot be sustained but is exposed for what it is - a political action designed to discredit me as the Labor Federal <span class="highlight">representative</span> for La Trobe and to enhance his own electoral prospects at the Victorian State election to be held this Saturday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730517_reps_28_hor84/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ILO convention is concerned with specific grounds of discrimination in employment, but it makes provision for extension after consultation with <span class="highlight">representative</span> employer and worker organisations and with other appropriate bodies, into other areas where abolition of discrimination might be pursued, for example, discrimination in employment on the ground of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of the Bill are to (a) provide for 2 members of the House of Representatives for the Australian Capital Territory elected on the basis of single member electorates, with effect from the first sitting of the Twenty-ninth Parliament; (b) provide for full voting rights for both members for the Australian Capital Territory with all the powers, immunities and privileges held by other members of the House of Representatives; (c) divide the Australian Capital Territory into 2 single member electorates, of which one electorate shall embrace part of the Australian Capital Territory proper and the other electorate shall embrace the remaining part of the Australian Capital Territory plus the Jervis Bay territory - to be effective immediately following the expiry or dissolution of the Twenty-eighth Parliament; and, (d) provide  -  (i) for the setting up of a distribution committee, and (ii) for the inviting of suggestions and objections and preparation of a report to Parliament, along similar lines to that provided for the distribution of a State into electoral divisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Territory, with no mayor, no local government representatives and no State members means that the people are entirely dependent on their member of the Australian Parliament to a much greater extent than possibly anywhere else in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would appear then to be more democratic to have an even number elected each time for each Territory thus following the pattern of the major parties providing that each would have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The term provided for each of these territorial senators is not 6 years, the constitutional period for state senators (except in the case of double dissolution - always likely to be on); the term for territory senators will be the life of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730522_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was therefore only logical that we should from an early stage have examined the possibilities of bringing into existence the kind of regional community which, as I said in my speech to the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science on Australia Day, would be ‘an organisation genuinely <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the region, without ideological overtones, conceived as an initiative to help free the region of Great Power rivalries that have bedevilled its progress for decades and designed to insulate the region against ideological interference from the Great powers’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730524_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>by leave - The honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  inquired at question time this morning inter alia whether a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of IBM was accompanying officers of the Department of Social Security presently in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the IBM company has been with these officers in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730525_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following references in the Press to the withdrawal of a Press Gallery pass issued to  Mr B.  Everingham, I inform the House that  Mr President  and I have decided that  Mr B.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This decision arises from an incident in November last when  Mr Everingham  was found to be in the suite of rooms at Parliament House of the then Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives without authority and when no members of the staff were present. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President  and I regard  Mr Everingham’s  explanations as unsatisfactory and his action in entering an unoccupied office without permission is, we consider, unacceptable conduct for a Press <span class="highlight">representative</span> in Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, we do believe that it is right that the increase in population should in the circumstances at present existing, carry the right to an additional <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Although the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  made some light talk about the burdens that all back bench politicians carry, it is worth reflecting that in the Australian Capital Territory, where there are about 180,000 people - a population increasing at about 10 per cent per annum compound - or half the population of Tasmania, there is one politician, one <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the only body where any laws can be made affecting the people of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I am concerned about is the proposal now before the House that the Senate should have representatives from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simple truth of the matter is that the honourable gentleman asked in his speech - honourable members will recall the dulcet language in which he asked this question - ‘Is it not strange that there is not one elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of either Territory in the Senate to expound the case for the local inhabitants?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not think there has ever been a parliamentary <span class="highlight">representative</span> who has worked harder for a larger area or slice of Australian territory than has the honourable member for the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think the honourable gentleman can impose upon us his rather odd interpretation of the meaning of these words especially when in the preceding paragraph of the Constitution the very expression extent of representation’ is included, not just the extent to which a man may be <span class="highlight">representative</span>, but the extent of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The answer is that he knows that it would not be hard for another <span class="highlight">representative</span> to outshine him, even in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We hope that the Northern Territory, as one of those <span class="highlight">representative</span> parts of Australia which is not tied specifically to the Australian Parliament and which is not designated specifically for the purposes of administration by the Commonwealth, might ultimately be developed and become an independent State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand it is true that the Northern Territory is an entity which, at the moment for <span class="highlight">representative</span> purposes, is under the control of the Commonwealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730529_reps_28_hor84/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know there are some who take the view that this is mere fiction - something which over the years has degenerated into a formality where the Prime Minister gives advice to the GovernorGeneral, the Queen’s <span class="highlight">representative</span>, and that advice is automatically taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730822_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe it is one of the most significant <span class="highlight">representative</span> institutions in the world because of the very structure of our system which is basically democratic and <span class="highlight">representative</span> of all the citizens and yet which stands in a community which is generally concerned with Presidents, royalties and everybody else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The purpose of drawing electoral boundaries is to achieve a parliament <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the majority of citizens; it is not designed to ensure a convenient and easy means for members of Parliament to ensure their re-election or an easy and convenient way for them to represent their constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730823_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In choosing to ignore this advice and instead to hand over Lake Tyers to a group of Aborigines described by their own <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the Victorian Parliament as having ‘at best extremely limited experience in or knowledge of farming operations and probably a complete absence of knowledge of the more vital problems of farm economies’, the Victorian Government showed a cynical disregard for the cause of Aboriginal land rights to which its spokesmen at the same time were paying lip service. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730829_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, they excluded Towra Point for a very simple reason and that was, as I said in answer to an earlier question, that, without any technical advice whatsoever and in an endeavour to save the 3 Liberal Federal members in Cook, Barton and St. George, they selected Somersby as a possible site because  Mr Barry  Cohen, the Labor member, was the <span class="highlight">representative</span> for that area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be historic, but if one looks at the figures from a Queensland’s point of view, as I am bound to do as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of that State, one finds that something like 72 per cent of the money allocated in the Budget by this Government for urban programs has been allocated basically to Sydney and Melbourne. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730911_REPS_28_HoR85b/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From some of the comments I have heard regarding this enrolling procedure, I feel that the Minister has embarked on a course of procedure which could be called a little irresponsible which must be costing quite an amount of public money, in order to achieve the establishment of a committee that will completely belong to the Minister and therefore, I say, it could never be truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the feeling of the Aboriginal and Island people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730925_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, for a private member to keep in contact with the people and offer service to the people who elected him to be their <span class="highlight">representative</span> with the assistance of one staff member is impossible for any member who is intent on doing his job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With the Government’s direct involvement in the operations of local councils it is essential that service is able to be offered, that the national <span class="highlight">representative</span> is able fully and correctly to be informed and that an avenue for obtaining information is readily available to the electorate itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730926_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the second reading speeches on these 2 Bills which we are dealing with in this cognate debate the Minister for Services and Property said that for the purposes of section 24 of the Constitution a Territorial senator is not to be regarded as a senator for the purpose of requiring that the number of members of the House of Representatives should be as nearly as practicable twice the number of senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with all the other referendum proposals that are being put forward by this Government, pulled out of the hat after being put into the hat at the whim of Caucus, why is it that the Government has not thought of amending section 24 of the Constitution - if the legal advice the Government has received is good - so as to make it clear that the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a Territory referred to in section 24 is equal, under section 1 22, to a State senator? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that responsible government means independence for the people so that their representatives are responsible to the people they represent for the government of the particular Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730927_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Commission that will be set up as a result of this report will be widely <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It puts the onus on the community through its various <span class="highlight">representative</span> organisations and through the Australian Education Council, which consists of State Ministers for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that it could quite easily become nonrepresentative simply because there is such an enormous amount of ministerial discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say for a moment that the present Minister would allow a situation to arise which could be designated as unrepresentative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So we are concerned to see that the <span class="highlight">representative</span> nature of the membership of the commission is specified in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This organisation believes that the appointment of both an experienced teacher and an experienced parent as well as other persons broadly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the community is clearly appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That body stated very clearly that it wishes to see a <span class="highlight">representative</span> balance maintained in the membership of this Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I seek to point out once again that the Opposition is concerned to make sure that membership of the Commission is truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> and truly guaranteed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Opposition and honourable members who have spoken on the Government side have been concerned to make sure that this Commission, as I have said, is truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> and not capable of becoming a moribund centralised organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission will be not representing but <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the interests that go to make up the community and those involved in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, the amendment could allow greater participation on the Schools Commission so that it is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the total community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Senate insists on these ill drafted amendments that have been put up by the Opposition this evening and returns them to the House of Representatives no doubt the Schools Commission will not come into being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind the members of the late Government that they exercised grants under section 96 apparently on their own decision and certainly not on decisions of panels of independent, schools and the Australian Education Commission, or even on decisions of a <span class="highlight">representative</span> committee such as the Interim Schools Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731011_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We feel that because of the <span class="highlight">representative</span> nature of the Schools Commission, as envisaged in our amendment, it is unnecessary for the functions of the Commission to be duplicated by a State board. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Secondly, we believe that the clause, as it is outlined in the Bill, does not guarantee any really <span class="highlight">representative</span> nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I might say to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan),  who I do not think will be the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of that electorate after the next election, that at least I speak with genuine feeling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731015_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is at present no Northern Territory representation on the Board of Directors of the Trust or Trust committees, although in July 1973 the Executive Committee of the Trust recommended that a <span class="highlight">representative</span> be appointed to the Board from the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-36-15">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I just want to remind him that the problems that he talks about in his electorate are problems which were inherited by him from the previous Liberal <span class="highlight">representative</span> for McMillan and that the problems were developed over a period of 23 years of Liberal-Country Party administration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I should also like to indicate to the House that it seems to me that there would be great advantage in such a council, if it could be brought into being having not only Ministers from the States who have direct responsibility for secondary industry and those Ministers from the Australian Government who work in the same area but also having a certain number - say 6 - of the leaders of industry <span class="highlight">representative</span> of Australian-wide industry as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It was also agreed that we should develop a planned program of cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges between Australia and China, and that <span class="highlight">representative</span> missions in these fields would be exchanged in 1974. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is to say, because a Minister has set about his public duty to keep the public construction program of this country operating in an effective way, he is to become the subject of intimidation by a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of this organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731107_reps_28_hor86/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We already know it is the smallest electorate, and therefore its <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this House, who is the Minister for Services and Property, is quite unable as he so often demonstrates, to have any understanding of the problems of those members representing large electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The extraordinary reaction of the Acting Minister for Education, the PostmasterGeneral  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  and the Government which indicate that it cannot live with these amendments leads one to the conclusion that the Government does not want an independent commission <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the State departments, the Catholic system and the teaching profession. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst it had on it representatives - in inverted commas - of national employer organisations, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Commonwealth Department of Education, the State Department of Labour and State technical education authorities, which had been invited to nominate members to the Committee, the members were appointed as individuals and not as representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main reasons why the Opposition is so insistent on these amendments is that the general undertaking which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had given to those involved in education was that people <span class="highlight">representative</span> of Catholic education and of the teachers would have representation on the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Bryant)  said that the Government had chosen not to appoint the Commission in the way we are suggesting because, fundamentally, the Government found it too difficult to involve all the <span class="highlight">representative</span> groups in the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable members opposite spent a great deal of today’s debate praising the work of the Committee to which the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  originally appointed 10 notable Australians expert in particular aspects of education and broadly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of interest groups involved in the administration of Australian schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Schools Commission was debated originally in this House honourable members opposite advocated a set of amendments which would have effectively excluded from participation in the Commission representatives of teachers and of parents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yet tonight they insist that such representatives must be included in the Commission even against the wishes of the organisations concerned - and those wishes have been made very clear indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us look at some of the organisations which the Opposition suggests are <span class="highlight">representative</span> of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731127_reps_28_hor87/#debate-21">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the vote a <span class="highlight">representative</span> decision of woolgrowers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the results raise questions in relation to the <span class="highlight">representative</span> nature of the Australian Wool Industry Conference? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For instance, one might think that all the Aborigines at Hermannsburg, south-west of Alice Springs, were of the one group and one <span class="highlight">representative</span> would speak for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The logical thing to do was to convene some gathering which would be <span class="highlight">representative</span> of them, if it were possible to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I take up the point made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory that those people are not necessarily <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are large areas of Australia in which the simple electoral system will not produce a person <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least there will be 41 Aboriginal people on the ground, working for their people as their direct representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>None of us in this place have any way by which we can give any guarantees about how <span class="highlight">representative</span> duties will be carried out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report issued by the Department of Urban and Regional Development insists that regional councils should consist of one elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of each council? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His preference for State parliamentarians being representatives is understandable because I think just as deviously as he does: Put enough State parliamentarians on a regional council and control it so that it will in no way provide an embarrassment to an inept State gov ernment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That simply confirms what honourable, members on this side of the House have said for years and years, that is, that the Australian Wool Industry Conference is not <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the whole wool industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731128_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The dispute between the political parties in the Australian Parliament, of course, took practical effect just before Christmas last year when the present Government changed its recognition from Taipeh to Peking and withdrew its <span class="highlight">representative</span> from Taipeh and sent one to Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government had told the people, and for years past as leader of the Australian Labor Party at the last 2’ House of Representatives elections I made it quite plain, that we would change our diplomatic representation from Taipeh to Peking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731129_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is laid up in another place by a curious combination of a government that was defeated on 2 December and a Party that has not a single <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731204_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s policy is based on the report of the Interim Committee for the Australian Schools Commission under Professor Karmel - a unanimous report by a committee composed of representatives of all school systems in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government accepts that opinion of that <span class="highlight">representative</span> and skilled Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the honourable member for Corangamite mentioned, the growers in the industry were told by the Labor Party spokesmen before the general election that they believed in elected representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they required a direct vote of the industry in that instance in order to ascertain the effect on growers rather than a vote of appointed representatives, why did they not be consistent and stick to the same formula for the Apple and Pear Corporation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the grower representatives will be appointed from the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The legislation places tremendous responsibility on it to be truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of all the apple and pear growers in this country and to act in an exemplary and efficient manner on behalf of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that a reasonable distribution of the 4 growers appointed as representatives initially would be two from Tasmania, one from Western Australia and one from Victoria. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Victorian <span class="highlight">representative</span> would represent the pear export section of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is not picking names out of the air; he will appoint the people nominated by these <span class="highlight">representative</span> bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to see at least two Tasmanian representatives out of the four. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It means that the pear growers would be represented on the Corporation largely by the Victorian <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growers in the Mount Lofty Ranges in my own State where apples of good quality are grown in quite fair numbers see the problem of membership there as being a matter of appointing one more grower <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731205_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does that mean, as it appears to mean, that the Government of Australia will have its own <span class="highlight">representative</span> on all of these boards down to a local area community centre or hospital - the State does not have representatives on them at the moment - and that it will also have representatives on all of the State organisations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731211_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For instance, the term ‘interim  chairman’  is to be dropped; payment for members of the Corporation will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, except for the Commonwealth’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Board who is a senior public servant; and payments of remuneration will be made from the funds of the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to be unduly critical of the Minister for Social Security, who personally to me is the soul of co-operation, but I was astonished - if I may intrude this matter - to be telephoned by a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Press tonight at 9 o’clock just before I was about to speak and asked: ‘Would you care to comment on a statement just made by the Minister for Social Security on private health insurance?’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740320_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That a member of the Queensland State Parliament would ask a question which contains damaging references to elected representatives without first checking the facts h unbelievable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740402_reps_28_hor88/#debate-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Three years ago - in fact, in February 1971 - I was fortunate enough to be a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of this <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Department has also adopted the practice of including at least one consumer <span class="highlight">representative</span> on each of the industry panels established to provide the Government with advice on the problems concerning particular sectors of industry and on matters affecting their future development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740403_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-30-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of primary industry in the Australian Capital Territory I want to make several points to the honourable member about the question he asked. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of the 3 members of the Board only one was a contributor <span class="highlight">representative</span> which is why imaginative investment policies were never undertaken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another person who was at the meeting said that he heard an extraordinary statement by the Minister’s <span class="highlight">representative</span>, and it went along these lines: ‘If any of you people say that a meeting occurred here today we will deny that such a meeting occurred’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A second request was made and when there was still no reply a third request was made for him or his <span class="highlight">representative</span> to attend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They included the Prime Minister’s refusal to attend their mass meeting or to send a <span class="highlight">representative</span>; his Government’s array of anti-farmer measures; his series of insensitive statements about farmers and farming, and the emotive expressions used in Forrest Place by him and by the Minister for Services and Property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740404_reps_28_hor88/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I share the view that was expressed by other speakers, that the Minister has made a wise decision in choosing to name the new seat Tangney, because it will honour the first women’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did the spokesman deliberately mislead the Canberra Times’, because I have been given to understand that there were not 3 people at the meeting but at least 12 people representing the private hospitals - including a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of private nursing homes, with the object of canvassing their opinion of his proposed amendments to the scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true, as I understand it, that  Dr Deeble  asked people at the meeting in Melbourne of representatives of the private hospitals that they should treat the meeting as confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the point is that the Minister’s personal adviser said to one of the senior representatives of the private hospitals of this country: ‘If you agree to these amendments, then you will get the fourth table’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That has been stated by a <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the flood co-ordinating <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Government, appointed by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  along with the Premier of Queensland and the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Jones, I have had many meetings with all authorities con.rerned and we are in the process of formulating a plan - a workable scheme - under which we hope to have every town and city practiable in a better position to withstand these tragedies should they occur in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe, for the reasons that I have advanced, that the Leader of the House and the Australian Labor Party again are showing a complete contempt for this, the House of Representatives, the lower <span class="highlight">representative</span> chamber of the Australian Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-34-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If there has been any factor which has been a disgrace to Australian politics ever since the beginning of <span class="highlight">representative</span> government it has been the constant rigging of ballots through the system of electoral redistributions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-47-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect the Government takes hold of section 24 of the Constitution, which places an obligation on this Parliament to have twice the number of people here as in the Senate, and says ‘Well, as far as the Northern Territory is concerned we will have 2 representatives in the Senate for the one <span class="highlight">representative</span> here’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He is prepared to give to the Northern Territory 2 Senate representatives, yet that particular electorate at this stage has one of the lowest numbers of electors on its roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand he seeks an equal voice and one vote one value and ail of those nonsensical principles that do not work out in practice, and on the other hand he acknowledges that he is not prepared to give full and adequate Senate <span class="highlight">representative</span> voice in the Senate to the 2 representatives of the Northern Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having researched the voting pattern for the past 20 years or so for both of these areas, it seems almost certain to me that in the Australian Capital Territory we will have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Labor Party and a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be a miraculous situation if the Australian Labor Party were to gain 2 representatives from the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should not forget that this is the crowd that is saying that it does not matter how big an electorate is or if one is a country <span class="highlight">representative</span> - I am not talking about the Country Party, I am talking about Labor, Liberal or Country Party members - and that it does not matter whether one’s electorate is 50,000 or 100,000 square miles as long as it contains exactly the same number of people to represent as the electorate of the Minister for Services and Property, who represents a little pocket handkerchief electorate in Sydney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We should not forget, as was pointed out by a previous  speaker,  that the Government’s proposal is to have 2 Senate representatives of the Northern Territory when it has only one member in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This means that while we say that every State - we include Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia as the small States - shall have 10 representatives in the Senate irrespective of the number of re- representatives from each State in the House of Representatives- <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740710_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although in the office of Solicitor-General I had the great honour to represent our people in many places both here and overseas, to sit in this House as the elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Division of Wentworth is to me the greatest honour of all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740716_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Wannon said a lot about the attitude of the Government in the national wage case and quite wrongly said that the submission put on behalf of the Government by me or my <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the national wage case did not have the endorsement of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a large number of wool growers, I am very deeply concerned about the claim that was made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  that 3 members of the Australian Wool Corporation had stooped to the level of completelydisregarding their responsibilities as members of the Corporation by conspiring with the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Sinclair),  and thereby placing in jeopardy the welfare of the people engaged in the wool industry, in order to promote an attitude within the Corporation in regard to price levels for wool that was designed only to embarrass the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740718_reps_29_hor89/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We wish to ensure, amongst other things, that clause 32 is amended to add a sub-clause to require the Executive to have an ‘affirmative resolution’ passed by the Senate and House of Representatives before any regulation takes effect and, that regulations shall cease to have effect at the expiration of the period of 12 months after the date on which they took effect unless each House of the Parliament passes a resolution approving the continuation of the regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the reasons I have given this is unmistakably the most important change in a constitutional sense not only to ensure control of the Executive by the Parliament as an essential ingredient of <span class="highlight">representative</span> government but also to prevent abuse of Executive powers and to practise the policy of open and honest government with Parliament acting as the means by which the public is informed and protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740723_reps_29_hor89/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think a Minister who does not know in the middle of one week what is going to be done in the beginning of the next week should be called upon to explain why he cannot tell a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people in this House what his intentions are about raising the pension, when he will link it to average weekly earnings, and give the people an assurance so that they will know when their purchasing power will be restored, thus taking pensions out of financial and political considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740725_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would rather see it set in terms of the priorities that the people closest to the community are able to assess and not the priorities set by those who happen to be <span class="highlight">representative</span> of larger areas, as we all are, and who are not able to relate as readily as can State members of Parliament or members of local councils in assessing the needs of a community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740801_reps_29_hor89/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As this vote, if carried, would almost certainly have led to the expulsion of the existing <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a government with which the Australian Government has diplomatic relations, what is the reasoning behind his claim that this matter was only a procedural question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740802_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-36-13">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No distribution should permit a situation where a party or a coalition of parties which secures a majority of votes does not secure a majority of members in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To permit otherwise would be to perpetrate a travesty of <span class="highlight">representative</span> government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian people truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> government and to give practical expression to the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln, which still echo down through the ages and linger in the minds of all democrats, namely: ‘Government of the people, by the people, for the people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Opposition believes this to be desirable in a <span class="highlight">representative</span> type of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In those circumstances the quality of representation would be greatly undermined as electors faced continual changes in both their elected representatives and their electorates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is easier to service an electorate which has a concentration of voters in urban areas than to service an electorate where there are a large number of small towns and hamlets which their <span class="highlight">representative</span> must visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the basis of representation is that there are matters affecting either of the Territories in respect of which representatives of those Territories should have a voice in the passing of the laws which relate to those Territories, that right is already given by the representation in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, within the last 12 months the Australian Capital Territory has been given an additional <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Many measures that concern the people of the Australian Capital Territory are debated in that chamber but the people of the Australian Capital Territory do not have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> to participate in any debate in the Senate, as they ave no opportunity to send a man or a woman to express their point of view in that chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are still being denied the right to send a <span class="highlight">representative</span> or representatives to the Senate because of the bitter opposition of the Liberal and Country Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A bitter fight developed in the Northern Territory, and it was not until 1 922 that the electors of the Northern Territory were able to send a <span class="highlight">representative</span> to the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a number of years  Mr. H.  Nelson, father of the present Administrator of the Northern Territory, fought incessantly in this House for full voting rights, because although he was the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Northern Territory he had no voting rights at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it was not until 1968, after the present Administrator of the Northern Territory,  Mr Jock  Nelson, had made many a stirring speech in this House in relation to representation for the Northern Territory, full voting rights for its <span class="highlight">representative</span> and Senate representation, that the honourable member for the Northern Territory in fact received full voting rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under section 122 of the Constitution machinery is laid down for giving all electors of the Commonwealth a vote in choosing a <span class="highlight">representative</span> for both Houses of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the Country Party in particular, supported blindly by the Liberal Party, still refuses to give the people of the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">representative</span> voice in the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As such it is desirable that the people of the Northern Territory have a voice in both Houses of the Parliament so that they are able to argue for and against the measures that from time to time come before the House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What do people from overseas think when they go to the Alice Springs district and they are told that the people who live in this international tourist resort do not have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> voice in the Senate and that they cannot even vote in referenda which propose changes in the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the Northern Territory is a Territory its affairs are influenced by this Parliament- by the Senate and the House of Representativesmore than the affairs of the States are influenced by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, the annual appropriation for ordinary government activity comes under the scrutiny of both Houses of this Parliament- the Senate and the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is there justice in the Senate being allowed to pass judgment on important issues which affect the every-day lives of the people of the Northern Territory when they cannot get a <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the Senate’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Government, and the Labor Party when it was in opposition, have consistently supported every move to give the people of the Northern Territory a <span class="highlight">representative</span> in both Houses of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those arguments were proved invalid by the decisions of those who voted in the last election and returned the honourable member for the Northern Territory to this place as their <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Government going to send him here to look after himself as the Senate <span class="highlight">representative</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as a matter of arithmetic, what justice is to be found in these figures: 240,000 Tasmanian voters elect 15 representatives to the national Parliament; 95,000 Canberra voters elect 2 representatives to the national Parliament; and 30,000 Northern Territorians elect one <span class="highlight">representative</span> to the national Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only other argument worthy of the name which has been advanced against the Government’s stand on this matter was raised by that doughty traditionalist,  Senator Greenwood,  and repeated, I am sad to say, by a much more worthy <span class="highlight">representative</span> of this Parliament, my friend  Mr Killen,  the honourable member for Moreton. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on the Government side believe that if we have to have a Senate we should try to make it a House which is a little more <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we in the Australian Capital Territory had our new assembly of 18 elected legislative assembly members, 2 members of the House of Representatives and 2 senators, we would have one elected person to more than 5,000 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we look at the smallest States, we see that Western Australia has one elected member for each 387 electors, South Australia has one elected member for every 527 electors and Tasmania has one elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> for each 480 electors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is how I believe the position should be so that the constituents can go to the parliamentary <span class="highlight">representative</span> who represents their political point of view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How real, how genuine is the little theatre of mirth on the part of one <span class="highlight">representative</span> opposite who is unknown to me? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The only way that the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory can exercise their rights and their duties as free and equal Australians citizens is for them to be represented wherever there are <span class="highlight">representative</span> institutions, including the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Since the very beginning of <span class="highlight">representative</span> and responsible government, governments have aimed at delivering to all Australians, no matter in which part of the continent they live, the same quality of service and the same quality of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have 2 Federal members in the House of Representatives representing the people of the Australian Capital Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Northern Territory covers 520,000 square miles but it has only one Federal <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could be marginally out in these figures, but I believe that at the 2 Constitutional Conventions the Labor movement had one <span class="highlight">representative</span> out of 135. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Representatives of the people whom we on this side of the Parliament represent were not members of the various State parliaments at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, whilst it is proposed that representatives of Territories in the Senate should have full voting powers they would differ in important respects from other senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told that section 24 of the Constitution is not to apply to them yet they are to attract to themselves power equal to those of the true Senate representatives of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems strange, putting it in the lowest possible key, to claim that these people would be full senators for the purposes of some sections of the Constitution- for example, section 22 and 23 relating to votes and quorums in the Senate- but not in others, for example, section 24 relating to the nexus between the number of senators and the number of members in the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I say this knowing that the Government has received advice on the point but how can you have a situation in which a <span class="highlight">representative</span> is a senator one minute and not the next? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been altogether too much dishonesty within this chamber from members of the Opposition who neither understand nor want to understand, and from the vested interests whether they are in certain <span class="highlight">representative</span> bodies of the medical profession or whether they are in private health insurance funds, which generously subsidise their political activities, and which do not want this change to take place, in spite of the benefits that it will contribute to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the outset I want to say to <span class="highlight">Representative</span> Katter that when he talks about Australianism many new members in this Parliament- people like Representatives Mathews and Lamb- are here because the conservationists in this community are sick of being trampled by the mining lobbyists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As for <span class="highlight">Representative</span> Katter’s concern about royalties in mining communities, I have been advised by <span class="highlight">Representative</span> Fitzpatrick that he obtained 75 per cent of the vote in Cobar; so that refutes his stupid reasoning. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These 6 Bills found their way to this Joint Sitting and they are opposed even in this last hour by the Liberal and Country Parties, not out of wanton obstructionism but because this side of the chamber, <span class="highlight">representative</span> of opinion held over a wide spectrum of the Australian people, believes that they are bad in principle and are likely to detract from the effectiveness of our parliamentary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740807_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I appeal to the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this chamber of the Postmaster-General  (Senator Bishop)-  I apologise for not having advised him that I was going to speak on this subject tonight but I notice that he has come into the chamber because of the nature of the accusations that have been made- to intervene in this matter and to stop his own Party from manipulating and twisting the media, as this admission by none other than the Queensland Campaign Director,  Mr Bart  Lourigan, indicates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740924_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the Australian Council of Trade Unions- it has taken a position that is widely understood as being <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the view of the trade union movement- has submitted to the Government that, in the course of establishing what would be a common policy to deal with the present economic situation, including both inflation and unemployment, in Australia, the Government should consider favourably the introduction of import quotas or the introduction of quotas allowing smaller amounts to come into Australia than exist under quotas already. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740925_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I rise to make my maiden speech fully conscious of the important task I have been given as the democratically elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people of Riverina. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am aware and delighted to hear that the New South Wales State Minister will be visiting the area this month, but as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people, I would be neglecting my duty to them if I did not emphasise the need for action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps most importantly I am here to speak as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Riverina people on legislation being considered by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741003_reps_29_hor90/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not seeking to go over history and therefore score political points, but I do say that in the position which I formerly occupied as an employers’ <span class="highlight">representative</span> in this field I believe that the report of the working party from which I have just read very relevant extracts would have been adopted and implemented by the Liberal-Country Party Government had it remained in office in 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ACTU <span class="highlight">representative</span> was of the view that the basic requirement to overcome the Moore v. Doyle problems was adequate amending legislation to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration An which it anticipated would be accompanied by complementary State legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the ACTU <span class="highlight">representative</span> thought that the provision of a moratorium on challenges for a specified period might be necessary to enable unions to put their affairs in order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The employers’ <span class="highlight">representative</span> regarded the rectification of the problem disclosed in Moore v. Doyle as primarily a matter for the Australian Government and the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1973 we introduced an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which sought to remedy the defect which up until that point had been a characteristic of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act by allowing a Federal body to take into its membership people who were not employees within the strict sense of the word as so tightly interpreted by the High Court, provided that the organisation remained predominantly an organisation <span class="highlight">representative</span> of employees who were employees in the true and strict sense of the word. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So what we did last year was to permit employee organisations to enrol persons in occupations akin to those of employees, provided that the organisation remained effectively an organisation that was <span class="highlight">representative</span> of employees in or in connection with the industry for which the organisation was registered and which conformed also with the eligibility rule of the organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741016_reps_29_hor91/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But apart from that, back in one’s electorate, where I believe that a member of Parliament must be a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people within his electorate, how can he represent them when he has only one person to do the typing for him, to answer the telephone and take account of the daily correspondence that comes in? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we had that kind of representation then I believe that some of the trenchant criticisms that are heaped upon the party system of government would be overturned because the member would be more truly a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people and could more effectively operate within the party system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741017_reps_29_hor91/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Taking a sample of a child’s work at the end of the year and saying that it represents his ability as displayed over the whole year’s work is like taking a patch of soil out of a paddock, analysing it and saying that it is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the soil content of the whole paddock. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741119_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On Tuesday of this week I was interviewed by a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a major American power generating group who indicated that the group would take at least 10 million tonnes of coal a year if we were in a position to provide it, and that this would escalate to 30 million tonnes a year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741121_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Where there are opposing views, informed and meaningful debate should be permitted with a view to working out ways and means of responding to public aspirations for a simplified yet truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> electoral system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ministers from the Departments of the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory (formerly Interior), Aboriginal Affairs and a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Minister for Immigration have also attended from time to time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741125_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to say, and say quite emphatically, that in considering myself a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of all the people of the electorate of Wide Bay I respond with a sensitivity and a generosity that would meet with the endorsement of my electorate whenever I am invited to attend a certain function in my capacity as member for the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to a report in the July 1974 issue of Channel, the official journal of the ABC Staff Association, that ABC Commissioner Dorothy Edwards, speaking to This Day Tonight staff, claimed it was just as well they had not shown the Antonioni film on China as the ABC’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> in Peking, Paul Raffaele, could have been killed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741126_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-25">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One particularly worthy of consideration is that a much larger and more <span class="highlight">representative</span> board of management could be appointed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I challenge the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay),  the Opposition spokesman on urban and regional development, to cite any specific instance in which I, as the Australian Government <span class="highlight">representative</span>, have ridden roughshod over any State Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I have in mind that the membership will consist of a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the State association representing eligible organisations, a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of either the Australian Society of Accountants or the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and an officer from the Department of Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741127_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a wonder that he is even prepared to come here as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people of the Darling Downs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whether jokingly described as ‘classic De Mac Rococco ‘ or ‘ late Goldwyn Spanish ‘ there is no doubt that it is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of an era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It speaks highly of the integrity of the Meat Board Selection Committee that it rejected such pressures and the appointment of a true grower <span class="highlight">representative</span> was recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister wishes to choose the grower representatives from a list prepared by the Australian Wool Industry Conference so that he can cull those he does not want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also have to protest at the propositions floated at the recent Australian Wool Industry Conference where the Minister’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> indicated that the Minister would not choose people who were beyond 65 years of age. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In effect the Minister, through his <span class="highlight">representative</span> at the AWIC was attempting to influence the selection without having to accept responsibility for the ideas floated on his behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is merely a farcical recitation by the Minister’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> of what the Minister proposes and there is no opportunity for the AWIC to get its views placed before the Minister or even to be given scant consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It thus protects the wool grower by requiring that the Australian Wool Industry Conference, as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of wool growers, shall approve of the use of the money in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At the same time I think there are good grounds to say that the Conference is not fully <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the questions to which I would like to know the answer, but I appreciate the reason for the Corporation not wishing to make the figures public, is whether this inventory is truly <span class="highlight">representative</span> proportionately of the Australian clip. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unfortunately, from my own experience as a past <span class="highlight">representative</span> of Australia on the Colombo Plan Council, there is often a very great discrepancy between the bank of expertise which has been built up in developing countries, paid for and assisted by countries such as Australia, and the efforts those recipient countries make in using those people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741202_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not to do so would be to deny constitutional <span class="highlight">representative</span> government in Australia and to set up a dictatorship in a House which is not based on that form of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>The Hospital Benefits Association in Victoria is slightly better because it has 8 contributor representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I am sure that they are a pretty <span class="highlight">representative</span> crowd of the average contributor to that South Australian fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are going to achieve the millenium in 6 months time, and for those 6 months we are to have these measures which will produce a situation in which any <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a private health fund who defies the Minister’s directions can be subject to penalties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In other words, as some of the Aboriginal land is vested in Australia we cannot ride roughshod over the Aborigines and we cannot ride roughshod over whoever is their <span class="highlight">representative</span> as far as the Australian Government is concerned: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I support the concept of a change in rotation so that half the members who are growers’ representatives will be changed, only on each occasion when there is a re-election. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741204_reps_29_hor92/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I do not believe that is is helpful to individuals -in fact it could be very damaging to them- and I do not believe that it does credit to the institution of Parliament or to <span class="highlight">representative</span> government that questions without notice concerning individuals should be raised in the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741205_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That company’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> said that during the first 10 months of 1974 the sales of codeine exceeded the imports of crude opium by more than 100 per cent and that the only reason why all 3 processors were not closed down and shortages had not been felt yet at the pharmacy level was the release by the Government in December 1973 of 238 tons of opium from the strategic materials stockpile. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The basic objection to the principle embodied in this clause is that under our parliamentary systemnot necessarily those of the countries referred to by the Prime Minister, many of which have very different systems- which is the result of evolution and of hundreds of years of development of a <span class="highlight">representative</span> system of democracy in Britain, members of Parliament remain individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There have been important occasions in the proceedings of this House on which members who have come in as party representatives- incidentally, those who have come in as Independents also have played an important part- have taken an individual role and a role that is sometimes at variance with that of their party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To provide that New South Wales must have 12 seats in a House of Representatives election contested by a party before it can have its name on the ballot paper only goes to point up the difficulties that can arise and the unfairness of these provisions to small Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is typical and <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the attitude that this Government takes towards regimenting and registering just about everything which could come vaguely within its ambit under the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750410_reps_29_hor94/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From our point of view, the Opposition sees an advantage in there being government representatives on the committee, but I personally find it dashed hard to understand why there should be a Government <span class="highlight">representative</span> if the Government is not going to provide money to this committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We on this side of the House are very tempted to move amendments to the legislation which would ensure that there would be no Government <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the committee unless the Government was prepared to provide some funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750422_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People who come to Australia from the United Kingdom, where the system is such that the shop steward is a power unto himself on the factory floor, fail to understand why some person, whether a trade union official or an employer organisation <span class="highlight">representative</span>, who is very far removed from the work place, should be able to dictate to them what they should do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For that reason it is essential, as suggested in the amendment foreshadowed by the Opposition, that we broaden the basis for the Council so that there are representatives of the Federal Parliament from both the Government and the Opposition sides, as well as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Minister for Education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750423_reps_29_hor94/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Similarly,  Mr el  Surani does not come to Australia as a PLO member but as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Arab League who also just happens to be a senior PLO officer and will likewise have no other purpose in this country than arguing the PLO view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-22-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister talks of numbers and of the principle of one vote one value yet this redistribution stands in stark contrast with all of those pious platitudes that he has expressed because the value of a vote is equally destroyed if many people in vast areas of Australia are effectively denied access to their parliamentary <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750529_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that at least a <span class="highlight">representative</span> from each manufacturing State with additional representatives from States such as Victoria, which produces about 60 per cent of the total butter manufacture, should be on the Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the employee <span class="highlight">representative</span> to be an employee of a dairy farmer, such as a very good and well versed share farmer who has considerable experience in the industry, or will it be someone who washes vats at a factory or has something to do with the manufacturing side? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that if an employee <span class="highlight">representative</span> is to be a member of the Corporation probably we should have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> from both sides of the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This was done by giving the manufacturers a third <span class="highlight">representative</span>, and this made it impossible then for those directly appointed by the Minister to have the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important thing was that in subsequent discussions on the number of manufacturers representatives, the Dairy Federation representatives advised that they would be happy with 3 producer representatives, providing that there were also 3 manufacturers representatives, that is, they wanted the number restricted to three. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750604_reps_29_hor95/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has been obvious to me since I have been a member of this Parliament and a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a large Aboriginal community along the Murray River that a restrictive factor in the education of Aboriginal children is their inability to identify with a European education system or to adjust to the conflict between preservation and change, between autonomy and ancestry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750910_reps_29_hor96/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are submissions which are made by the main <span class="highlight">representative</span> legal body in Australia and they are worthy of consideration by this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751009_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Consequently it is important that on the Advisory Council a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Department of Customs should sit in order that where it becomes necessary to put an embargo upon inferior goods which would constitute unfair competition with the Australian manufacturers who were observing the standards set by the Authority the need for prohibition will be understood and the Customs Department will be able to act quickly to protect the Australian manufacturer from that sort of unfair competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751014_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is relevant because there have been suggestions that in this day and age, the Viceroy of Australia, the Governor-General of Australia, should withdraw the commission of the Prime Minister who has the confidence of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under the Australian system of universal suffrage and triennial Parliaments, with a legally recognised and responsible Cabinet, it must, in my opinion, follow that so long as a Premier commands a majority in the Lower House, and so long as he is guilty of no illegal conduct which would evoke the exercise of the Royal Prerogative, he must be regarded as the competent and continuing adviser of the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Crown. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751015_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We now have the extraordinary spectacle of the Opposition, apparently recognising that it has failed to blackmail me into an election for the House of Representatives, seeking to bring reprehensible pressure to bear on the GovernorGeneral, the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Queen of Australia, to achieve that very thing, and to do so by dismissing me as Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who twice in less than 3 years has been elected with a majority in the governing house and who continues to have a majority in that House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is an essential consequence of the equality of status existing among the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that the Governor-General of a dominion is the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Crown, holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the <span class="highlight">representative</span> or agent of His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain or of any department of that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751021_reps_29_hor97/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Standing order 95 leaves the way open to any member of this House to refer a matter to the Privileges Committee, but the honourable member for Chifley indicated his shallowness of intent by doing nothing other than using that means as a way of avoiding standing order 74 which rules out of order comments or imputations against the Queen or her <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760224_reps_30_hor98/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am ashamed to see in Australia today the situation which now exists in which Parliament itself has been diminished and downgraded and in which the Governor-General, the viceroy, the direct <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Queen whom we share with the United Kingdom, has himself participated in politics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760302_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>From a state of complete and utter distrust when no Japanese <span class="highlight">representative</span> of that Government could visit Australia without some fear and trepidation, we have developed to the point where it remains in the national interests of both countries that our officials and our peoples be encouraged to come closer together so that we can not only overcome the sad legacy of the past but also together, and only together, build in South East Asia and in the Pacific a region of peace and security for us all.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am hopeful that the Government will take some note of what I have said today, look at this very important area of Melbourne- I guess it is only <span class="highlight">representative</span> of other areas- look at the lack of services in the area, do some planning and make available funds to provide the services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760826_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Frankly, as a member who represents an outer western electorate of Sydney, I am ashamed that any honourable member would pretend to be a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of that western area and adopt the attitude that unemployment is not a serious problem in the western suburbs, and would go into his caucus room and support the Government in its attitude that it should not bring in a system of unemployment relief, particularly for our young people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760921_reps_30_hor100/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to overcome the problem which local government faces we propose that there be a local government <span class="highlight">representative</span> from each State and otherwise the membership should remain as it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In October 1973 I met the Premiers and put to them a proposition I had put in my Party’s election campaign a year before- that aldermen and councillors from each State should choose a <span class="highlight">representative</span> to speak and vote on their behalf at the Loan Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would have been possible for the Loan Council to admit local government representatives because the Financial Agreement, pursuant to section 105A of the Constitution, permits the 7 heads of government in Australia to agree on such arrangements for the Loan Council provided they are unanimous on the question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At that time all the Liberals who attended that Convention, that is, 8 Liberals from South Australia and Tasmania and the Liberal Movement <span class="highlight">representative</span> from South Australia, voted against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet at the Melbourne meeting of the Constitutional Convention a year ago when the proposition came up for a vote that the Constitution should be amended by holding a referendum to provide for the borrowing of money by the Com-  monwealth for local government bodies constituted under the law of a State or Territory, there again State Liberals who attended- the 8 from South Australia and Tasmania and the Liberal Movement <span class="highlight">representative</span> from South Australiaall voted against the proposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was carried of course because the local government representatives supported it and they still want it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Leader of the Opposition was seeking to establish a unitary, unicameral system of government with one Australian Parliament vested with plenary powers consisting only of a House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  aim was to replace the elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> in local government and the elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> in State government by a Federal bureaucrat who would be instructed to follow the guidelines of policy determined by a single parliament here in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is at least pleasing that the Government has rejected the proposal to include only 3 local government representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This number has been increased to six but much of the force of this change has been dimmed by the failure to give each State a guaranteed local government <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With only 3 local government representatives a gross imbalance of representation could not have been avoided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>The wisdom of Solomon could not have devised a system which would have selected 3 local government representatives from the whole of Australia in a way that was even remotely fair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even a single <span class="highlight">representative</span> from each State would face a mammoth task in putting a viewpoint acceptable to the range of local government within its own borders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The task is multiplied a hundredfold if selection of local government representatives is undertaken without regard to State representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Much as I subscribe to a wider viewpoint in government I am realistic enough to accept that disregarding State differences in nominating local government representatives just will not work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this reason we urge the Government to revise its approach and to write into the legislation the principle that each State should have its own local government <span class="highlight">representative</span> elected from its local government organ. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which local government should participate is, of course, recognised by the inclusion of sufficient membership to ensure that each State has a local government <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Bill now stands, it is the Australian Council of Local Government Associations which will nominate the 6 local government representatives on the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment I have moved would provide that the <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations from each State should be chosen by the elected members of local government bodies in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the aldermen and the councillors in each State should decide who should be their <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Advisory Council we are establishing by means of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely not even he can find an argument based on State sovereignty for saying that the local government <span class="highlight">representative</span> on this Council should not be chosen by the aldermen and councillors in each State rather than being chosen by this Australian Council of Local Government Associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The States, under the Bill as it is, have no right to say who will be the local government representatives on the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment would provide that the State <span class="highlight">representative</span> in each case should be chosen by the people who have been elected to local government bodies in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all the aldermen and councillors within a respective State select their <span class="highlight">representative</span> on this Advisory Council this must have greater moral support from local government than if that person were appointed by a body in Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>All we are asking the Government is to give the right to local government aldermen at their local grass roots level to have a say in the matter of electing their <span class="highlight">representative</span> on their Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The aldermen in Tasmania are the ones who should determine who will be their <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The heavy hand of a centralist directive as to the method of election of representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It provides that there shall be one <span class="highlight">representative</span> from local government from each of the 6 States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason the number was increased from three to six was simply to make it physically and numerically possible for there to be one <span class="highlight">representative</span> from each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot for one moment conceive that the Council of Local Government Associations will take its charter under clause 8 ( 1 ) (k) and then say: ‘We will not appoint one <span class="highlight">representative</span> from South Australia and we will not appoint a <span class="highlight">representative</span> from Queensland.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second point is that the various States may desire their representatives to be chosen by different means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has seen that because I have said that the method by which the elected aldermen and councillors in each State should choose a <span class="highlight">representative</span> for that State on the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations should be in accordance with a method determined by the Council of Local Government Associations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, this Australia-wide body is the very body which under the Government’s Bill will choose the representatives of local government for all the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems reasonable enough that, representing local government all over, it should suggest the method by which the aldermen and councillors in each State should choose their <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously in this amendment I am not suggesting that the Federal Government should, by regulations under the Act, prescribe the method of election of the local government <span class="highlight">representative</span> in each State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not suggesting that the State Parliament in each case should suggest how the local government <span class="highlight">representative</span> for that State should be chosen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that the very body which this Bill nominates- the Australian Council of Local Government Associations-should suggest the method by which local government elected persons in each State should themselves elect a <span class="highlight">representative</span> for themselves on the Advisory Council for InterGovernment Relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, under the Bill, the body could choose a <span class="highlight">representative</span> for any State, for several States or for all States, who would not be the choice of the aldermen and councillors in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it is quite obvious that the real objection of members on the Government side who have spoken is this: They want the representatives from local government in each State to be as unknown or as unrepresentative as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the aldermen and councillors in each State were to choose their <span class="highlight">representative</span> themselves the person they choose would speak with very great authority indeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we do as regards the States representatives is to see that they are members of Parliament and that they are in effect chosen by a majority of members of their parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Here the person who is chosen as the local government <span class="highlight">representative</span> does not have to be an elected person at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their real motives are to make this Advisory Council for InterGovernment Relations as far as local government is concerned as little <span class="highlight">representative</span> and as little known as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ensured that the boards of the Council would be largely autonomous and as <span class="highlight">representative</span> as possible, and that their membership would rotate, in order to avoid the formation of cliques and entrenched interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By reducing the numbers of people sitting on boards administered by the Australia Council from a range of upwards of eleven to perhaps as low as six, including the  chairman,  the Government has made very real the possibility that some boards may no longer be <span class="highlight">representative</span> but will become the playground of one or another clique. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761007_reps_30_hor101/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have no doubt that if the New South Wales Government was prepared to negotiate as to what type of commission would be acceptable to both the Federal Government and the State Government a commission could be set up that would be <span class="highlight">representative</span> of all proper groups. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Recently I saw an Australian Broadcasting Commission program which involved a conversation between a person from a Middle East country and a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To overcome this deficiency, the Australian <span class="highlight">Representative</span> Basins Program has been devised by the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under this Australiawide program up to 100 carefully selected <span class="highlight">representative</span> catchments are being assessed in detail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That unfortunate consequence occurred because a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the union was a member of the board of an Australian governmental commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That union <span class="highlight">representative</span> encouraged the commission to take action which, in fact, was not in the best interests of either the Government of the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of that union on the Postal Commission encouraging it at the time, apparently, to take a view which was, I suggest, a disgraceful one. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that this does raise a serious matter of principle concerning conflict of interest between the pressures upon a union or worker <span class="highlight">representative</span> actually sitting on the board of a corporation like the Australian Postal Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In that case, the union <span class="highlight">representative</span> was in a conflict situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>He was a <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Commission when his union was in direct and in this case illegal conflict with it I believe that such a situation raises serious problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761116_reps_30_hor102/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the changes to the Australian Broadcasting Commission will be that although the Commission of nine will remain the same there will be a requirement for each State to have at least one <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761130_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the Newport power station dispute is only <span class="highlight">representative</span> of what is a developing trend in this country and the rest of the western capitalist world- that unions are increasingly concerned not only with straight industrial issues such as wages and conditions of employment but workers, through their unions, are becoming increasingly concerned about what they do with their labour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Because of the intention for the Commission to comprise a <span class="highlight">representative</span> from each State and also at least 2 women, as well as the Government’s intention to retain all existing commissioners, it will be necessary to deem certain of the present commissioners as representing a State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Officers of the public service who qualify for diplomatic passports while representing Australia overseas are as follows: Permanent Heads of Commonwealth Departments; the Head of an Australian consular mission overseas; an officer of the Australian Public Service who is leader of an official delegation or is its sole <span class="highlight">representative</span> at an international conference; a member of Her Majesty’s Australian Diplomatic Service (other than a member of the Administrative and Technical Staff); a member of the staff of any Australian Government department or instrumentality assigned to a diplomatic Mission overseas and accorded diplomatic status; and a Permanent Head of a State Premier’s Department accompanying his Premier overseas on an official visit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761203_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-33-21">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One suspects, when looking at it coldly, that the motivation was a devious device to allow the Government to get rid of the staff <span class="highlight">representative</span>,  Mr Webb,  because in the reconstituted proposal that it put and in the amended version that it is now putting a staff <span class="highlight">representative</span> is not specified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say quite categorically, despite all the comments which have been made, that at no time can anyone prove that the Minister has said that the ABC Staffs Association <span class="highlight">representative</span> will be removed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One can twist this around any way one likes, but the fact is that the appointment of a staff <span class="highlight">representative</span> has failed to raise the intellectual standard of the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, after studying 600 high quality submissions, the recommendation is that appointments should be as <span class="highlight">representative</span> as possible, but not at the cost of merit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having yielded to staff pressure and retained  Mr Marius  Webb as the staff <span class="highlight">representative</span>, the Government has decided that  Mr Webb  will be outnumbered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Should the Tribunal find that the community favours more autonomy being given to the broadcasters by allowing them to develop and largely administer their own codes of programming and advertising practice, the Tribunal would then withdraw from the day-to-day administration of standards, and examine only those significant matters of standards or regulation referred to it by a <span class="highlight">representative</span> body of the broadcast operators, such as the Broadcasting Council designated in this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761206_reps_30_hor102/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This amendment will allow the appointment of a <span class="highlight">representative</span> from Tasmania, a <span class="highlight">representative</span> from South Australia, which are not represented on the Commission at the present time, plus another woman, without in any way interfering with the term of office of the current commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In proposed section 31(1), at the end of proposed paragraph (b) add the following words: “of whom one shall be the elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff”. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Marius  Webb was elected by the ABC staff as its <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest to the Committee that, to write into the legislation at this stage a provision which requires a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Staffs Association to be appointed as a Commissioner, is, at the very least, premature and probably runs counter to a proper concept of the role of the Commissioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One problem is that representation on a commission or a board of directors by, say, an elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the staff or employees of an organisation can mean mere tokenism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The commission or company can ensure that it has one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the staff as a director. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appoints 8 other people in a manner which 6 ensures that the one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the staff is outvoted eight to one every time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another problem which sometimes arises is one of conflict of interests between the role which a person has to play as a member of the commission and his role as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in a sense he is a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the union concerned because he is the general secretary-treasurer of the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the staff is able to sit in the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, that is one problem, I ask: If we have commissioners who are in some sense <span class="highlight">representative</span> of outside bodies, do we have an elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the consumers- Auntie ‘s Nieces and Nephews or whatever organisation we might have? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the management, such as the General Manager? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we have a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of government in a formal sense who formally reports to government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen how the present incumbent, the elected staff <span class="highlight">representative</span>, in fact reports to his constituency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Jull)  and the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  earlier read out excerpts of a public report which that <span class="highlight">representative</span> made lining up the ‘goodies’ and the ‘baddies’ on the Commission, as far as he was concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are members of the Commission to be appointed to represent some outside body or are they to be people appointed in their own right because of the expertise they have developed in various areas and perhaps <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a broad range of interests, not necessarily of a specific group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonetheless I think it would be a mistake to write into the legislation a provision requiring a staff elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It points out that Marius Webb is not a Staff Association <span class="highlight">representative</span> but represents ABC staff. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spoke to that Opposition amendment which deals with the appointment of an elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff and pointed out that, while there had not been previous provision for this, it had been something that a previous Minister had allowed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In rebutting the argument for a staff <span class="highlight">representative</span>, some mention was made of the Joint Consultative Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have never spoken one word to him, but he is the duly elected <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the ABC Staff Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like the honourable member for Wimmera  (Mr King)  who asked the Minister to give some indication about Tasmanian representation, I think it is fair to say that the Minister has made it quite clear that a Tasmanian <span class="highlight">representative</span> will be appointed to the Commission very shortly and a Tasmanian will remain on that Commission for as long as this Government is in office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The operative word is ‘<span class="highlight">representative</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is preferable to restricting contact through the avenue of one <span class="highlight">representative</span> who may or may not adequately represent the views of the staff? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Yes, my apologies, there was to be an independent  chairman  also, who presumably was to be the sole <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposal is for a  chairman,  one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of commercial radio; one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of commercial television, 2 representatives of the Australian Broadcasting Commission- balancing the national sector of broadcasting with the commercial sector- two representatives of the public broadcasting sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In our view, from what the Government said it expects that sector to hold a significant proportion of representation, so we suggest 2 representatives of that sector to balance the others- one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australia Council; one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Australian Film and Television School; one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Postal and Telecommunications Department; and one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Schools Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19761207_reps_30_hor102/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under section 13, if one wanted to get elections back into kilter one could put forward a phoney proposition to a tame and friendly Senate, which would reject it, and then one could ask for a double dissolution around the end of June and organise an election for the House of Representatives some time in July. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770217_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>With great respect to members of the Opposition, I believe that I can include them when I say that parliamentarians and the population simply would not know then in which electorate they were living, who their <span class="highlight">representative</span> was or where they were going. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770224_reps_30_hor103/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It should do so on both counts; on the basis of resources because as I have pointed out, the number of people employed in private enterprise has dropped while the number of people employed in the public sector has increased, and on the question of money being taken by governments as distinct from being left in the pockets of private persons, I feel it is a pity that there is no <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the so-called Workers Party or whatever it is called in this House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770316_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Certainly, to be fair- I want to be fair- the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Tasmanian apple growers with whom I discussed this matter when he visited Canberra with other apple grower representatives said that the Tasmanian people would take a responsible attitude and they would not flood the market, which would be of course finally to their disadvantage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Against the background of recent Australian politics, argument has developed that the Monarch, or her <span class="highlight">representative</span>, must be excluded from every area of political involvement, with the consequence, so the argument goes, that if this happens, it becomes unnecessary that there be a head of state within our political system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This local example, with a British precedent, serves to highlight the advantage of the presence of a Head of State of the status of the Monarch or her <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But just as George V was forced on at least 2 occasions to intervene in the politics of the nation, so is the Queen’s <span class="highlight">representative</span> in Australia, by the very essence and the framework of our Constitution, forced to intervene at critical times in the affairs of our nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would hope that those who fiercely espouse that cause at least understand that in our system the Monarch or  Her  <span class="highlight">representative</span> has a role with far greater implications than simply supplying Royal Patronage to the highly regarded Red Cross Society and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770317_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why should its representatives in this House want to give the people in the Northern Territory a vote or even the right to representation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If the High Court in May were to determine that within the meaning of the Constitution, representation for the Territories does not mean representation in the full sense of the word but means perhaps only the right for a territorial <span class="highlight">representative</span> to appear in a Parliament and speak when invited, and does not mean the right to take part in any debate and certainly not the right to vote, territorial representatives would be mere mummies from the point of view of effective representation of the Territories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If those challenges are successful, irrespective of what the decision of the Australian people is on 2 1 May- we would hope it would be a decision giving the people of the Territories a right to vote in future referendums- it would be null and void for the very reason that section 128 only gives to the electors in the States- we seek to interpose there the words ‘and the Territories’- the right to vote in a referendum in the same context as they would have the right to vote for the election of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Irrespective of what happens on 2 1 May, the High Court may decide in May that the people of the Territories have no right to vote for a <span class="highlight">representative</span> in the House of Representatives and therefore exclude them from the right to vote in future referendums. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770330_reps_30_hor104/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that when he is looking at the special representation, where there is a capacity for the Minister to appoint 2 people to the Corporation, he might give some kind of assurance that, if the one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the exporting and processing industry is not a moderately sized or small Australian owned processor, that section- the Australian owned sectionof the industry will receive some sort of representation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit to the Minister that his recognition of the role which they can and should play in such a Corporation seems to merit either an additional member by right or else the special consideration of the appointment of one of the 2 special representatives from the industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should like some assurance from the Minister that, if by some mischance a West Australian is not chosen by the producer consultative group to be appointed to the Corporation, a West Australian would be considered for one of the special <span class="highlight">representative</span> positions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the reasons why there is a reserve power for the Minister which enables him to appoint the members of the Corporation is to ensure that there is reasonable regional representation and, of course, at least one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the sheep trade and one <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the beef trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770531_reps_30_hor105/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The safeguards involved in Australia ‘s system of <span class="highlight">representative</span> and responsible government, the independence of the judiciary and the procedures adopted by our courts, the freedom of the Press and the possibility of parliamentary or ministerial investigation or other inquiry are important factors in the maintenance of human rights in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770601_reps_30_hor105/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am not aware that a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of IBM is accompanying the representatives of my Department in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  inquired at Question Time this morning inter alia whether a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of IBM was accompanying officers of the Department of Social Security presently in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is true that a <span class="highlight">representative</span>  of the IBM  company has been with these officers in Canada. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The IBM <span class="highlight">representative</span> who has been with them is a computing systems engineer and he joined them on 1 May 1973. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, in the mid- 1 960s, a <span class="highlight">representative</span> - <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were not in government then, honourable members will recall, although the coalition parties were- of another computer supplier accompanied a <span class="highlight">representative</span> or representatives of the then Department of Social Services on a visit to the United States of America when the visit was for the purpose of inspecting computer installations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Surely the Government, as the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people of this nation, should look at ways and means of providing funds for necessary and essential services in the most equitable way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two main points to what he is asserting: Firstly, that a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of IBM Australia Ltd accompanied officers of the Department of Social Security in Canada when I was Minister for Social Security. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I pointed out yesterday after Question Time in this House, the accompaniment of officers of the Department of Social Security by a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of IBM occurred without my knowledge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was advised by the Department, as I pointed out yesterday, when it contacted its representatives in Canada that in fact the association had been terminated before the contract had been made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, the public servants pointed out to me that they were a little miffed at the toughness of my attitude because they said it had always been the accepted practice in the past on somewhat similar occasions under conservative coalition governments that that sort of association take place between a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a potential tenderer and people from the Department visiting overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, in the mid-1960s, a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of another computer supplier accompanied a <span class="highlight">representative</span> or representatives of the then Department of Social Services on a visit to the United States of America when the visit was for the purpose of inspecting computer installations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is appropriate that IBM should have had its case put by the honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Baillieu)  who is a member of the Melbourne Club where IBM has a <span class="highlight">representative</span> in  Mr Andrew  Grimwade– <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I guess also that he had the reputation of having the biggest nose in the business, but let me add that it was a very canny nose because he was in fact a most effective member of this House and <span class="highlight">representative</span> of his people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780309_reps_31_hor108/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The second person indicated that he had a very clear recollection of the incident and at the time believed that I had over-reacted in being so firm in my objections to a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of IBM Australia Ltd being associated, in Canada, with officers of the Department of Social Security, and thought that I was being excessively harsh in indicating that that sort of thing should cease and should not happen again. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780316_reps_31_hor108/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The councils and their composition can be effected by Queensland legislation and by decisions of the Queensland Government- this is one of the things that I should have thought the Leader of the Opposition would have picked up in his distorted claims about the Queensland Government- and it is quite clear that changes could be made in Queensland legislation so that we had a council that was not <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One has just to look through the evidence taken at hearings of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism to see that on two or three occasions it has changed its attitude on cheap fares and that unfortunately not only with the travelling public but to a degree with the people of the tourist industry, it is starting to lose its credibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780413_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the fact that that <span class="highlight">representative</span> is going at Commonwealth cost and with the idea of representing Australian industry, I have written to the organisation to ask it whether it is aware of those circumstances and intimating to the organisation that I would have thought it preferable that at least an Australian resident should attend on its behalf. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I should now like to refer to the speech made at the IMF meeting in Mexico City by the Australian <span class="highlight">representative</span>, the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  who was standing in for the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  or the Minister for Finance  (Mr Eric Robinson). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the policy approach advocated by the Australian <span class="highlight">representative</span> at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting at Mexico City was contrary to that needed to generate world economic recovery and was accordingly against the best interests of this country. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment makes the point that the Australian <span class="highlight">representative</span> was out of step with the policies enunciated by the IMF, which emphasised not just the reduction of inflation levels, as this Government is doing, but also the fostering of economic recovery, development and growth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have the  chairman  with a casting vote, and with the employer’s <span class="highlight">representative</span>, a department <span class="highlight">representative</span> and the National Director plus four unionists, a blueprint for the successful operation of the college can readily be sustained after having been discussed at the round table conference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has been in the invidious position of being the Prime Minister’s appointed <span class="highlight">representative</span> because of the terminology of the former Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, he was strongly critical of there being an employer <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Australian Council and on the Executive Board, but I must say that his view is not shared by the union movement, which did not oppose it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third point I want to make, which takes me more closely into the Bill, is to draw attention to the way in which the power has been shifted within the nature of the Trade Union Training Authority so that we now have elevated in place of a broadly <span class="highlight">representative</span> board- other honourable members have referred to this- a National Director appointed by the Minister operating in the context of an executive which clearly can be controlled by management when the  Chairman  appointed by the Minister is prepared to go in that direction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780531_reps_31_hor109/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Today in this House we are being invited to affirm that this Parliament considers it desirable, by reason of the political and economic development of the Northern Territory, to confer self-government on the Territory and for that purpose to provide, amongst other things, for the establishment of separate political, <span class="highlight">representative</span> and administrative institutions in the Territory and to give the Territory control over its own treasury. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780602_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I know that there have been other so-called advisers at work such as  Mr Frank  Purcell,  Mr Michael  Anderson who happens to work out of the office of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  and  Mr Mick  Millar who represents himself as being a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-In supporting the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street),  who is the <span class="highlight">representative</span> of an electorate, as we all are, I want to draw attention to the fact that what he is doing, perhaps inadvertently, is reducing the differentials between members of this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will comprise five people from the private sector and it may be that the other three can come from the private sector also because there is nothing to say that they shall be representatives of the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In reply to the reasons given by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  for not accepting our proposed amendments I want to make the point that he seems to have given ground to some extent on the basis that he indicated that he would consider the appointment of a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were encouraging the Government to consider a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Department of Trade and Resources because he would have knowledge of overseas trade. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780817_reps_31_hor110/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Another objection to the Estimates committees is that they detract from the House of Representatives itself, interfering with the business in the House, distracting from the <span class="highlight">representative</span> function and downgrading the <span class="highlight">representative</span> chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791025_reps_31_hor116/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As was mentioned by the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  its first fully <span class="highlight">representative</span> elections were held while we were there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791107_reps_31_hor116/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When I visited the country as an international observer and as a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of this Parliament it was obvious that the people there were sick of the war and that they clearly voted for peace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791108_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-40-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The working group will be <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the Department of Home Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Education, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Science and the Environment and the National Library of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The seminar was important in two ways: Firstly, it provided the Working Party with an opportunity to ascertain at first hand the views of people and organisations directly concerned with Library services for the handicapped; and secondly, for the first time in Australia a wide cross-section of handicapped people, <span class="highlight">representative</span> of libraries, voluntary agencies and government instrumentalities and others interested in the problems met and exchanged information and experiences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791113_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As well as receiving representations from a large number of individuals, there have also been considered expressions of opinion from <span class="highlight">representative</span> bodies including the National Farmers Federation, the Law Society of New South Wales, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Taxpayers Association of Australia and a number of other professional bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the general point I want to make is that the honourable member for Lilley is a <span class="highlight">representative</span> of a party devoted to the reduction of the public sector. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sample of Divisions was not random, nor was it particularly <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the distribution of Divisions between the States or between inner metropolitan, outer metropolitan and rural areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-8">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Analysis suggests, however, that there is no reason to believe that the results themselves were not <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth <span class="highlight">representative</span> informed the meeting that on the basis of data available, it would not accord with Australia’s international obligations to exclude the Japanese from any wider areas of the Coral Sea, given Japanese fishing activities in the area for over 20 years without detriment to tuna and martin stocks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth <span class="highlight">representative</span> invited provision of data from game fishermen to supplement information available to the Government and assured game fishing representatives that Japanese operations would be phased out if there was evidence to show adverse effects on fish stocks or on operations of Australian commercial fishing interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791114_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-56-30">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Whilst I acknowledge the difficulties involved, I deplore the approach adopted by the Minister for Transport, whose <span class="highlight">representative</span> told the Australian Road Transport Federation annual conference in Hong Kong last September: <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The major function, the historic function, of the lower or <span class="highlight">representative</span> houses of parliament has been to monitor the expenditure of the Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791115_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, on the information available from the Bureau of Statistics and on a careful analysis of that information, a person on average weekly earnings is spending a lower percentage of those earnings on average rent in the capital cities of Australia than he was four or five years ago, during the period of the Government of which the honourable member for Reid was a <span class="highlight">representative</span> and a Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nevertheless, in all the countries visited, with the exception of Uganda, the delegation observed that a fairly sophisticated system of <span class="highlight">representative</span> government, apparently satisfactory to the domestic conditions of the countries concerned, has been introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The sections of the Bill dealing with student organisations will provide that: Membership of a student organisation will be voluntary; fees payable in respect of membership of a student organisation will be voluntary; compulsory fees can only be used for the provision of amenities or services; where the Council of the University makes compulsory fees moneys available to a student organisation for the provision by that organisation of approved amenities or services, the Council must first be satisfied that the governing body of that organisation is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of its members; in addition, where the Council of the University makes compulsory fees moneys available to a student organisation for the provision by that organisation of amenities or services, then it is the duty of the Council to ensure that the moneys are applied only in respect of the provision of amenities or services that are not of an academic nature, that are of direct benefit to the University, and that have been declared in university statutes to be amenities or services in respect of that organisation; compulsory fees moneys are not to be paid to a national organisation which represents students but they may be paid to national student organisations whose principal function has to do with sporting or recreational activities, or with a particular education, social or cultural field, or with the interests of post-graduate students; financial statements are to be prepared and audited each year showing details of the manner in which compulsory fees have been expended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The undertaking was contained in documents provided on 3 November 1978 to representatives of the Northern Land Council (representing the traditional Aboriginal owners). <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791120_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-73-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, over the last month or so not only have I had extensive consultations with the leaders of the Australian Gas Association but also as late as last Monday, for example, I spoke to a very <span class="highlight">representative</span>, if not a totally <span class="highlight">representative</span>, group of gas utility operators from country areas in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791121_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The clauses tie the hands of the Australian National University Council and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Council by providing that moneys collected by way of fees shall not be made available to any student organisation- the Australian Union of Students is not actually named at this stage- unless ‘the Council is satisfied that the governing body of the organisation is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of the members of the organisation’; and by providing that Councils may not pass statutes to authorise expenditure on ‘amenities or services that are not of an academic nature’ unless the provision of these amenities will directly benefit the University, the College of Advanced Education or its students, or promote sporting, recreational, educational, social, cultural or post-graduate interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The opponents of the AUS claim that the organisation is unrepresentative, and there is no doubt that in recent years it has had a very bumpy record. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Each withdrawal has necessarily made the AUS less, not more, <span class="highlight">representative</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If AUS is thought to be unrepresentative, the answer is to make it more <span class="highlight">representative</span>, to get more of our 250,000 university students to participate, to run for election, to vote, to argue, and to propose new policies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The worst way, the method adopted in this Bill, is to destroy the AUS, to make it less <span class="highlight">representative</span> by interfering with the tradition of academic freedom and to prohibit the councils of tertiary institutions from enabling fees to be paid except for very narrow- one might say, almost selfishpurposes confined to ‘student welfare’, narrowly defined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where it is the case that the council of a university makes compulsory fee money available to a student organisation for the provision by that organisation of approved amenities or services, the council must firstly satisfy itself that the governing body of that organisation is <span class="highlight">representative</span> of its members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those capabilities that are required to provide a military response to the lesser contingencies which could arise with little or no warning; those high performance capabilities relating to a general strategic requirement as dictated by the characteristics of the environment rather than by specific contingencies and required to provide deterrence against the use of military pressures or military means by a potential enemy to achieve its objectives and which could not be acquired within the period of warning likely to be available before a major threat to Australia could develop; and a <span class="highlight">representative</span> selection of second tier or substitute capabilities- moderate cost, moderate performance, short lead time systems, that could be acquired in relatively large numbers during a period of developing threat- to enable the development of operating techniques, procedures and doctrines in a short period of crisis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it also a fact that the Government will not support similar moves by any State <span class="highlight">representative</span> on the Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791122_reps_31_hor116/#subdebate-57-59">[More…]</a></p>
