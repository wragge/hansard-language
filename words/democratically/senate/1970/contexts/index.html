<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where will this new move end and what can be done to identify these people and give some protection from unwarranted interference with <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected leaders? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710514_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for what was said by  Senator Poyser,  it is a great tragedy that the leader of another country who was <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected has been overthrown by the military forces of his country and has taken his own life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For this to have happened after a relatively short time would cause grave concern to everyone who hears that a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected leader has been overthrown by illegal military forces. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Mr Neruda  was not only one of the greatest poets of the century and the holder of the Nobel Prize for literature but also a diplomat in the service of the Chilean Government and a supporter of the previous <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government of that country, will the Minister ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to make inquiries as to whether the allegation by the Chilean junta that he died of natural causes is in fact correct? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730925_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whereas the Senate is not only an independent House of Review elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the people with its own mandate to protect their heritage and constitutional rights, but is the States’ House by which all Australians in their own sovereign states formed long before Federation can bring together ideas and plans and resources for their mutual benefit and advancement, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740919_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-That letter points out how over the years those office bearers have been very <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761111_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-43-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your petitioners most humbly pray that this Senate in Parliament assembled should help the Hungarian speaking community to regain confidence in the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Senate known for its conscientious and wise judgement in restoring peace and faith in democratic principles, which unfortunately are missing from the present management set-up of the Ethnic Radio broadcasters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761208_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the National Women’s Advisory Council has not been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the women of Australia; That the National Women’s Advisory Council is not representative of the women of Australia; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So even though in theory you can <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elect a council on the lines I have set out, in practice if the Director or his nominee desires not to implement any recommendations, those recommendations will not be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700318_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet honourable senators opposite have the audacity to say that we do not show much regard for members of the House of Assembly and that they are not <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700409_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does he use his own feelings or preferences, his own thoughts on a particular subject that concerns him and about which a law has been made by a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, the good of the community and its wishes are intended to be reflected in a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AH that the Government is doing is ensuring that the funds are not operated <span class="highlight">democratically</span> for their contributors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700520_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not a fact that Prince Sihanouk was removed from office by a unanimous vote of the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament of Cambodia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700820_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anything that I have won I have won <span class="highlight">democratically</span>, honestly and decently, and that is something to be able to claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700916_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-69-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We warn you here and now that this is the sum total of what will occur finally if the sittings of this <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament are shortened and the use of force of numbers is continued to the stage when Parliament will not need to sit at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701027_senate_27_s46/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Senate has been treated contemptuously in that an opinion reached by it <span class="highlight">democratically</span> and after full debate, namely, that a referendum be taken of those involved in the industry to learn their wishes, has been ignored by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710218_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister cause special investigations to be made into this incident with particular emphasis on the extent to which the outrage was politically motivated and the precautions that might be necessary to protect people who have been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected to the Commonwealth Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONI am sure we all agree with  Senator Bishop’s  suggestion that this was a monstrous outrage, even against any person, lt is even more terrible when it happens to somebody who has been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected to be a senator or to a person who has been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected to any office in which he serves the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710309_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister give an assurance that the proposed legislation will not become law unless it is requested after a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> conducted poll among Australian pig producers? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This platform is formulated by a federal conference, <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Ceylon is a member country of the Commonwealth of Nations and its Government is <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710421_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I asked where they stood in relation to this matter and if, as was implied in the question asked by  Senator Kane,  the Commonwealth Government could interfere in the decisions of unions made <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the rank and file, why did it not or could it not equally interfere in the amalgamations of these great monolithic organisations, such as the banks and other companies that have amalgamated not only with organisations in this country but also with overseas organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710817_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected representative of the people of this country, and I believe that a parliamentarian ought not to be restricted in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that opposed to these commissars was our great and powerful ally, the United States of America, steadfastly determined to oppose Communism and to support democracy even if supporting democracy meant sending troops into the Dominican Republic to depose  a  <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected president. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711013_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see no reason why a person who has been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected to this chamber cannot appear in the chamber in suitable, neat attire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I have stated, it is accepted by the South Australian Parliament, which is <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected, just as this chamber is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720229_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He called on young, spirited, <span class="highlight">democratically</span> minded men to resist, physically if need be, the shocking, communist socialist laws of the Labor Government of that time which was proposing to nationalise banks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Giles of course was <span class="highlight">democratically</span>, correct, except that those whom the  law affected did not have a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me remind honourable senators that, first of all, ITT attempted to prevent the election of the Allende Government - although we do not like that type of government, nevertheless it was <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected - and, having failed to prevent that Government’s election ITT set out then to destroy the Chilean economy as a means of destroying that Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister advise this representative of a communist dictatorship that this is a free country and that the question of Australian passports will be determined by its <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government without communist assistance? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that there are many medical benefit funds which are <span class="highlight">democratically</span> run and controlled by their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the answer is in the affirmative, does he believe that the Fund operates <span class="highlight">democratically</span> when the subscribers’ views were never obtained on the expenditure involved in this costly edifice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labour will re-constitute the AWIC and the Australian Wool Board on a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected basis and have an investigation and evaluation of wool promotion and research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>and its overt financial support of a political party, because the union serves no useful purpose, because it is not run <span class="highlight">democratically</span>- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730307_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the legitimate right to criticise and seek to change the Government’s defence policy by democratic process: on the other, the illicit claim to perform acts designed to destroy defence measures undertaken by the elected Government, responsible to a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does the Minister not realise that the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Palm Island Aboriginal Council, not the Queensland Government, issues permits to visit Palm Island? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730313_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are suggesting to us that the Attorney-General of a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government - a government <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected only last December - should not have available to him information in the possession of an office which was allegedly created for the protection of security in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The mind boggles at the audacity of people who say that there is a police state in existence when a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Minister knows what the police are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A police state is a state in which the police or quasi police organisations have authority over the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reverse of a police state is that society in which <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected officials have authority over the police. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730327_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-79-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Committee believes that as long as governments are <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected and there is full parliamentary responsibility to the electors, the protection of personal rights will, in practice, be secure in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730515_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are in the situation where a minority of doctors - not always <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected - are claiming as the heads of their respective organisations to be speaking on behalf of every doctor in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730829_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The  President  of that great country, a  president  who was elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the people, has been forced to take his own life because of the intervention of those who would not accept the decisions of the people who elected a person under the democratic system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The intervention of the Central Intelligence Agency in matters involving murder and the overthrow of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected governments should be considered in the same strain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730912_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the gravamen of their objection to this Bill is that they oppose the Australian people being given the opportunity to express, by referendum, their opinion, as to whether or not the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament of Australia should have constitutional power over prices. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730919_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it more than a little whimsical that a Prime Minister and a political party pledged to a republic in Australia, and particularly a Prime Minister who has stated publicly and on record that he sees the monarchy- I use his words- as being outmoded and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> irrelevant, should seek to use the monarchy for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740307_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is described by its short title as a democratic elections Bill and it purports to be a Bill by which a question will be submitted to the people of Australia by referendum to amend the Constitution whereby it is stated that the members of the House of Representatives and all the parliaments of the States shall be chosen directly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740314_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Section 1 5 of the Constitution, in committing the decision not to a political party, not to an Executive and not to an independent, but to the elected members of the State Parliament, I would have thought commits the responsibility to a body <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected and constitutionally indicated in that section. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, even if the point were to be made that the armed forces did have the right which by some curious source of misinformation  Senator Sir Magnus  Cormack relies upon, even if the armed forces had that authority, I should have thought that the honourable senator would have been well aware of the fact that the Chief of the Chilean General Staff, General Gonzalez Prats, opposed the coup which took place against the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government and fled the country and was subsequently murdered. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Government were pouring vast sums of money into an unprofitable enterprise then it would be answerable at the elections in a way in which the directors in Zurich, Amsterdam, London and New York of insurance companies that are operating in Australia are not responsible to their policy holders when they use their funds to defeat a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Australian government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those conventions which we all understand and know about in the Senate deliberately set out to provide for periods of stability of government on a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected basis. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751029_senate_29_s66/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may be all right for  Senator James  McClelland to say, as I remember him saying yesterday, that the Senate is not a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected House; but it is a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751030_senate_29_s66/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They follow an endless sequence of manoeuvres which the Opposition has pursued in order to remove a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government from office. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They have declined because the Australian people realise that so enthusiastic, so neglectful, and so insensitive is the Opposition to the feelings of the Australian people and the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> expressed will of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people that it is prepared to come at anything in order to get back on to the Treasury bench. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Then they will see just what the Australian people think of those who would be prepared to prostitute Parliament by presenting this piffle as an excuse for not allowing a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government to carry out the business of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751105_senate_29_s66/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the risk of encouraging or inviting criticism from the Government I propose to deal with some facets of those events when a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government, twice preferred and twice elected within 18 months, was summarily dismissed by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Minister agree that the comments which the Governor-General was forced to make arose from a situation which he created by dismissing a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government on 1 1 November last year and that the dismissal arose from the obstruction in this place of the Opposition at that time? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As I said in the short time in which I had to speak on the Budget debate, the main ground for the conduct of the then Opposition during the 1972-75 period in pursuing a course designed to destroy a government which had been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected twice within 18 months was its claim: Elect us and we will correct unemployment, inflation and a great range of other things’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of the sudden and violent coup d’etat which has resulted in the overthrow of Thailand’s <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government, is the Minister aware that many Thai students now in Australia are deeply concerned that their lives or safety might be endangered if they were forced to return to Thailand? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I posed this suggestion in the hope that  Senator Carrick,  to make this Bill work much better and more <span class="highlight">democratically</span>, might speak to his State colleagues in South Australia and point out how a lot of people there are being deprived of their democratic right to stand for council or to elect to the local government a person of their choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also find it hard to understand why the Government resists the idea of giving properly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected school boards a small amount of financial autonomy when both sides of the chamber have been happy to give to the private school sector almost complete autonomy in the handling of large amounts of government funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761117_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I may say so in passing, it is interesting, when one hears remarks about who is running the country and about the shocking malfeasances of trade unions in organising demonstrations against policies of the present Government, to note that there was certainly no objection from members of the present Government when they were in Opposition to the use of policy holders’ money by insurance companies and to the time that was taken by employees of insurance companies, which again was a burden on the policy holders of those companies and allegedly mutual life assurance societies, in demonstrations throughout Australia against the Labor Government which was then in office, having been twice <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected on a program of introducing legislation similar to that which we introduced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761118_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other thing that has always interested me is why the Australian Labor Party should continue with its wish for the abolition of the Senate when, by its own admission, the Senate is the only <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected house of parliament in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I say, on their own admission, this was the only chamber in the Australian parliaments which had been elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761130_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I close by saying that I put forward my views in the firm belief that this proposal is compatible with the future strength of the Senate and indeed will strengthen the Senate in the future as it will help to ensure that the Senate remains <span class="highlight">democratically</span> acceptable to the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770224_senate_30_s71/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A year after he left the Senate in 1962 he was appointed  Chairman  of the Sydney County Council and he occupied that important position until 1965- some 2 years, when he achieved one of his lifelong ambitions to be <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the people of Sydney as its Lord Mayor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a first step, acting on behalf of my Government, I asked all vice-chancellors and principals of colleges to look at the rules that the universities and colleges, as self-governing organisations, have for running the collection and application of student fees, to see, firstly, that they were <span class="highlight">democratically</span> levied and, secondly, that the funds collected were not used for improper purposes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we want to achieve the situation in which that <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected and representative Assembly’s recommendations may be implemented, there are various means by which that can be done. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion let me say that I think every one of these recommendations-  Senator Hamer  said that there were 51- carry a great deal of common sense, but surely the whole point is that the question was investigated and adjudged by the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected members of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that the Legislative Assembly has acted very properly and very <span class="highlight">democratically</span> to try to come to that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surely this <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected chamber should not have restrictions placed on it from which the High Court- that non-elected bench of justices- has managed to escape. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tomorrow at these important and vital party meetings members will be given the opportunity <span class="highlight">democratically</span> to make the decision on this controversial matter which has been discussed at the very highest level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781114_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an event happens that threatens the very power of this <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected institution- the Parliament- they do not even notice that it has occurred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not care what a majority of the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected representatives of the people say by way of vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790221_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly, those people have the ability to make representations to the relevant Minister or to the Prime Minister or to members of parliament; but if the Senate publicly called for representations and submissions and conducted inquiries in the open, with access for the Press while a decision was being reached, our affairs would be conducted far more <span class="highlight">democratically</span> and sensibly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It removed the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government in Iran and installed one of the most barbaric dictatorships to be found anywhere in the world- the dictatorship of that cowardly cur, the Shah of Persia, a man who flew around in aeroplanes apparently with gold taps and gold baths; the man who, according to some reports, in conjunction with his family has been able to ship $ 17,000m worth of assets out of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inference I draw from those paragraphs is not only that the organisation was incompetent but also that it was quite obvious that those in charge of it had to have their arms twisted up their backs before they would give  Mr Justice  Hope the information he sought under his charter- a charter from the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the problems is that I do not think that a number of the parliaments represented would qualify as democratic parliaments or <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder how much of the agitation against  Sir John  Kerr in 1975- he was hounded and cried down at universities and at various demonstrations in Australia- was contributed to by the subversion of Labor Party members because of their description of  Sir John  Kerr’s dismissal of a lawfully, <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a retrograde step, in what is supposed to be a democratic system, that the rights of a properly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected body to make decisions with regard to local community organisations should have been taken away arbitrarily and placed in the hands of the Minister himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt the Minister for the Capital Territory wants the advice of the House of Assembly, as the properly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected voice of the people in the Territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This would make the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Minister accountable for police actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is impossible to escape the conclusion that Australia and other nations are withholding recognition, not because of a careful analysis of the merits of the case but because they do not wish to run counter to the views of the front-line states, the Organisation of African Unity, some members of the Commonwealth, and some members of the Third World- a number of which are far less <span class="highlight">democratically</span> governed than is ZimbabweRhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790608_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has not the right, as a <span class="highlight">democratically</span>-elected senator, to say what he believes about Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I remind some of those judges that, in fact, they are in contempt of Parliament, which is an even higher offence, if they ignore the wishes of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790828_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are refusing to contribute their fair share to the revenues of elected government for its programs, <span class="highlight">democratically</span> arrived at, and they are creating gross unfairness between various sectors in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a need to do these things properly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span>, so that everyone who desires to speak for or against a project will have an opportunity to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not to be part of the Opposition policy because if it were, there would have to be government interference to ensure that they were <span class="highlight">democratically</span> constructed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement adds to my confusion, apprehension and disenchantment of this place as a forum for <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected senators to express a view verbally and in a vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There were the old fashioned Parliament men, if I can so describe them, like Jim Killen, who were against what they perceived to be an encroachment by the judiciary on the rights, prerogatives and preserves of the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected representatives of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not arrayed merely against the student associations on the various campuses- associations <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected, associations not captured by the Australian Liberal Students Federation, to which I will come in a moment and which is behind this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
