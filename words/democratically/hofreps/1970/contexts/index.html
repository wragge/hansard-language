<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For this gentleman to go to a foreign land and to rubbish his own land and its Government which was duly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected is to plumb the very depths of indecency. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750903_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected members of the Austraiian Labor Party in Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am talking about his conduct in the House as a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1977/19770818_reps_30_hor106/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the effect on his audience was that of a great man coming to support their movement when they were still at the bar of world opinion for having used violence on their own countrymen, their own revered leaders who had committed no other crime than that of trying to represent their people <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700310_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament must make itself <span class="highlight">democratically</span> responsible for the wellbeing and safety of all its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700312_reps_27_hor66/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We regret what we did last night, but unless the Government changes its attitude towards this democratic institution and this <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Opposition there will be more incidents like last night’s. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700409_reps_27_hor66/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be in parliamentary opposition to a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government must at times be galling and frustrating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected on two occasions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700414_reps_27_hor66/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parliament must be made to work smoothly, more often and <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700416_reps_27_hor66/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Moratorium is really an attempt to coerce a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government by strikes by street violence and by so-called happenings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700507_reps_27_hor67/#debate-25">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would rather that it be a more Socialist measure, and that its workings should conform more to the policies of a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700520_reps_27_hor67/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the House, along with many influential sections of the wool industry, believe that the AWIC would be a much better organisation if it were elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the wool growers, in the same way as the Parliament is elected by the people, rather than being appointed in the way it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700610_reps_27_hor68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The recent Vietnam Moratorium Campaign was an illegal operation and a defiance of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> enacted laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700826_reps_27_hor69/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the difficulties confronting the Labor Party, because of the way it is treated by the media, is the manner in which its policy is thrashed out in public by people who are <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the Party’s organisations in the various States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700916_reps_27_hor69/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian people have a long history of supporting and accepting the laws made by the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government of the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The laws have not always been easy or pleasant laws for many of the people to accept but the Australian community has shown a responsibility towards the maintenance of the rule of law over the last 100 years, a record of respect for laws <span class="highlight">democratically</span> arrived at I would say there is no better record to be found in the world than the record we have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700925_reps_27_hor69/#debate-17">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that is perhaps why we have been faced with this farcical situation today, why the work of Parliament has been set aside for today; why the most serious processes of Parliament have been prostituted to try to provide a smokescreen over the actions of the Leader of the Opposition who, on his own admission, has gone out to advise young men to ignore the decisions of this Parliament, to flout the provisions of Acts <span class="highlight">democratically</span> enacted by the Parliament for the nation’s defence, to scorn the law enforcement bodies and especially those in them honourably discharged from the Queen’s service and to advise the troops in the field in the face of the very enemy, to refuse to continue to fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19700929_reps_27_hor70/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said in this chamber time and time again, it is not a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected body representing the bona fide woolgrowers of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1970/19701028_reps_27_hor70/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even 300, 400 or 500 years ago universities were a little more <span class="highlight">democratically</span> controlled although discipline then was perhaps a little more rigorous when one did break the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710216_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The motion will give the House an opportunity <span class="highlight">democratically</span> to establish whether in fact the improvements in social service benefits which are outlined generally in the motion should be effected by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is also true, as the Minister pointed out in his statement, that if a immunity believes that the circulation of certain material is objectionable to itself as a community, it has the right, through its <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government to protect itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710222_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us always remember that we are members of a Parliament that is <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected to act in the best interests of the majority of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710401_reps_27_hor71/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are now living in a modern world, a one-day world, a world of mass communications in which we are entitled <span class="highlight">democratically</span> to look at and discuss prejudices throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710407_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, are not the commercial terms laid down to the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government of Ceylon more onerous than those extended to Malaysia and Singapore in normal arms and ammunition supply transactions and so stringent as to make it unlikely that Ceylon can fulfil them and so obtain any assistance from Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710427_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has not that right <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710429_reps_27_hor72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The British legislation, our legislation and other Acts throughout the world pay greater regard to the public interest, to the interests of other people and to the creation of a system which is responsible to some <span class="highlight">democratically</span> responsible body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alternative, which is certainly in accordance with my thinking, is to evolve a system which makes that privately imposed system, in the mixed economy type of situation that we have, the responsibility of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> appointed bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There must be some degree of orderliness in it, but it must be orderliness imposed by someone who is responsible to a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected institution such as the Parliament, or some board or tribunal that is itself responsible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710505_reps_27_hor72/#debate-35">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the first place they seek to usurp the role and the function of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710817_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are sick to death of strikes, demonstrations and the would-be Fascist dictators like  Mr Hawke  who are trying to take power out of the hands of this <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a strong supporter of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected unions and nobody can tell me that employers would not exploit employees if we did not have unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unions must have responsible and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected leaders representative of the people in the work force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710824_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have never been adequately investigated and they are not responsible to any <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710907_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-31-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I resent very strongly the action of the Postal Union in using this sort of tactic and I wish to register my protest in this <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19710914_reps_27_hor73/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Government go beyond the plea of the Prime Minister for magnanimity and compassion in the trial of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on charges of treason, and insist on the liberty of this openly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected leader. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711012_reps_27_hor74/#subdebate-1-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are likely to run things a little more <span class="highlight">democratically</span> in some respects in Papua New Guinea. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711202_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government’s policy - is: Let us have this opportunity for debate and for a vote to be taken, because the Government has an undertaking from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  that if all members of the Parliament, <span class="highlight">democratically</span> assembled without regard to party, favour or pressure, come to a decision on this question concerning the export of merino rams, then a i of us on all sides of the Parliament will  bc  duty bound to see that the flow of merino exports is continued, if that is desired, or that it is halted, if that is desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will the Government propose to the United Nations Assembly that the pitiful conditions of the nine million refugees now in West Bengal, and the situation in East Pakistan, pose a threat to peace and international security and that consequently the United Nations Organisation should endeavour to bring about a peaceful settlement that will meet the already <span class="highlight">democratically</span> expressed wishes of the people of East Pakistan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1971/19711209_reps_27_hor75/#subdebate-59-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Wool Industry Conference does not <span class="highlight">democratically</span> represent the views of the wool industry throughout Australia, particularly the small family traditional wool producer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720328_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is just possible, too, that there are people in the community who are not attached to any of the parties, lt is just possible that they take seriously the fact that the Parliament is the repository, or is supposed to be the repository, of the people’s rights and so they go past the member, they go past the Party and they go direct to the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament of the nation sitting as a Parliament - to what has been called the grand constituency of all the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not the same situation, as is implied widely on the other side of the House, as electors petitioning through their <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected representatives to this institution, They are just not the same things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720418_reps_27_hor77/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government had acted <span class="highlight">democratically</span> it would long ago have drawn up the uniform legislation with the States that the Minister spoke about covering all the rights that go with adulthood or the age of legal responsibility, such as the right to vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is the reason, it may be politically expedient but it is certainly <span class="highlight">democratically</span> contemptible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720511_reps_27_hor78/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Country Party, supported by its partner in crime, the Liberal Party - which polled 22 per cent of the vote for a total of 21 seats; nearly as many seats as its percentage of the total vote - is able to inflict its wishes on the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected city administration i;i the Greater Brisbane area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720817_reps_27_hor79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am simply asking this House as a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected body how it justifies allowing a sum of $1,200 per annum whilst it allows deductions of $364 for a wife, $208 for the first child and $156 for other children? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1972/19720831_reps_27_hor79/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government, which has been <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the people of Australia, has come into office at a time when Australian finances are better than they have been for many years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730228_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if the honourable gentleman wants me to spell out what T said publicly a few days ago then  I  will be glad to inform him that as the Australian Labor Party is <span class="highlight">democratically</span> based - unlike the Opposition parties - every member of the Party has a right to determine policy which will be submitted to the Parliamentary Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730306_reps_28_hor82/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The requirement for the Minister for Urban and Regional Development to approve regional organisations is a discretion that will be exercised <span class="highlight">democratically</span> and in the light of the Australian Government’s concern for the ordinary citizen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730523_reps_28_hor84/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would prevent the implementation of measures which are necessary to ensure that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission operates effectively; that agreements made do in fact represent the wishes of the members of the organisations; and that organisations themselves are <span class="highlight">democratically</span> controlled by their members. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730830_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister is going to a very considerable length to see that union officials are properly elected - <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected - by their unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There are many unions and unionists who, having <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected their officials, are prepared to support them through to a conclusion on any difficult negotiation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19730920_reps_28_hor85/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind that is far more desirable and far more in accord with the precepts that this place <span class="highlight">democratically</span> should hold dear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731022_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Parliament has been conducted <span class="highlight">democratically</span> and in accordance with the highest traditions of this august House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731023_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is found that these matters are being handled in that way and that no regard is being had to decisions of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected local government, and if speculators can go their own merry way without getting approval from the local planning authorities, it is time that the Housing Commission and other authorities took up all land development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731025_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The second is designed to amend the Constitution to ensure that members of the House of Representatives and members of the Parliament of the States are chosen directly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill therefore, simply stated, is a Bill for an Act ‘to alter the Constitution so as to ensure that ‘the members of the House of Representatives and of the Parliaments of the States are chosen directly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the people’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731108_REPS_28_HoR86%20(2)/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To that point I agree that that is a description of this Bill- and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the People. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not believe that the words ‘and <span class="highlight">democratically</span>’ should be included in the long title because they carry a very clear inference that the elections until now have not been carried out <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A curious result of this is that the Government is alleging that it was not <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected and that by the amendment of the Constitution there will be henceforth democratic elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Title, omit the words ‘and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the People’, substitute the words ‘by the People and that the criterion for determining the size of an electoral division shall be the number of the people within it’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do say that the words ‘by the People and that the criterion for determining the size of an electoral division shall be the number of the people within it’ should be substituted for the words ‘and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the People’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The words ‘and <span class="highlight">democratically</span>’ are emotive, highly argumentative and should be eliminated if there is to be a fair referendum. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#debate-22">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even though it may be faulty in logic, it is a fair description, but then it adds these words: and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the People. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Firstly, it is an assertion that the Government was not elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is putting the proposition that it was not elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now it wants to amend the Constitution to make sure in the future it will be elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also an assertion that there is not a single State Parliament that was elected <span class="highlight">democratically</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I give notice that I will be moving at the Committee stage, if I am permitted to do so - there are only about 15 minutes left for the second reading debate, a division and then 7 minutes in Committee - to delete the words and <span class="highlight">democratically</span>’ and add the following words:  and that the criterion for determining the size of an electoral division shall be the number of people within it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A Bill to ensure that the Members of the Parliaments (Australian or the States) are chosen directly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have sidestepped the real issue that is being debated in this House, that is, whether members of this House and of State Parliaments should be chosen directly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731115_reps_28_hor86/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first is that the authority to market the Australian wheat crop firmly belongs with the Australian Wheat Board which has 10 grower members who are <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the vote of the rank and file in 3 States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731122_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I point out that from the time this Federal Labor Government was <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the people of Australia, the backward Premier of Queensland has done nothing but attack it and make statements saying that he would not support any measures which come from this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1973/19731206_reps_28_hor87/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If one member represents 15 times the number of electors represented by another member who has equal voting on the floor of the Parliament, the Parliament is not <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740312_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other proposals are to allow an interchange of powers between the Commonwealth Parliament and the State parliaments and to ensure that members of the House of Representatives and members of the parliaments of the States are chosen directly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> by the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740313_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable members need to remember that there is no analogy between the Australian Senate - properly and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by all the people of Australia - and a hereditary House of Lords. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740408_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is recommended the majority of members of Boards of Directors of all funds should be <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the contributors and that full public disclosure of accounts is made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So the Liberal Party favours the present situation in which the directors of funds are not <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by the contributors but continue to be nominated by people who represent basically not consumer groups but hospital organisations and the Australian Medical Association and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are extraordinarily fortunate that this is a country which has a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected lower House and a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected upper House, that it has no House of Lords and that there is an opportunity for the people, where there is a basic and real impasse in the government of the country, to be given another chance to have a say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740409_reps_28_hor88/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a new Parliament with 17 new members in this House - <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by more than 500,000 people on 18 May - who will be denied the opportunity to debate this fantastically important issue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740711_reps_29_hor89/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that we are afflicted in this country- I use the word ‘afflicted’ advisedly- by Upper Houses which are not <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected, which are not elected by the people, which flout the very principle about which Benjamin Franklin talked in his words that I read to the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19740806_reps_29_hor89/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We see the influence of international imperialism within the orbit of NATO which finds great difficulties within itself in recognising the independent nonaligned policy pursued by the former  President  of the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government, Archbishop Makarios, who in my opinion should be reinstated in his position in Cyprus to lead that country along the path of non-alignment and non-aggression and to follow his peace-loving policies, instead of allowing Cyprus to fall into the hands of warmongering forces within the ranks of NATO so that it can be made a military base and further jeopardise the peace of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741031_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not good enough in this day and age when we are dealing with responsible and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected governments which have their own responsibilities in their own States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741113_reps_29_hor91/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-After listening to the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  I can state that unless one was very familiar with the situation in Queensland one could almost believe that the Government of Queensland was <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741128_reps_29_hor92/#debate-26">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems that daily the device of raising a matter of public importance is used by the Opposition to delay the business of the House and to frustrate the will of this freely and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are acting very <span class="highlight">democratically</span>, I must say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To state that there will be interference with the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> run medical funds is completely untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1974/19741203_reps_29_hor92/#debate-29">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This requirement is not something which does not exist anywhere else; it is a provision in almost every <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament with which we would like to compare ourselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750213_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the relationship between the House of Representatives and the Senate which they applaud and which leads to the situation that exists in this country today, the properly <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government cannot at any time govern for more than 6 months with any assurance of continuity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750218_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is difficult to know why all the members of the Opposition are so keen to do everything possible to try to destroy and to sabotage the actions of a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everybody knows what happened in Chile and the crucial role played by the organised medical profession in that country to bring down the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750219_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In these circumstances, everything possible must be done to maximise the decision-making powers of the boards and the Council and the position of administrative figures should be that of enablers, and implementers of <span class="highlight">democratically</span> arrived at decisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We want an organisation that has a strong co-ordinating role, an organisation that is free to develop an overall arts policy, an organisation that represents the interests of artists via the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected chairmen and, at the same time, an organisation that has the administrative ability to handle properly its dealings with the boards and negotiate with the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There also is a close relationship between this question and the degree of independence which these committees must be given under their <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected chairmen because, as with any large organisation of this nature, we are running a real risk of the octopus syndrome- the heart hes in the middle, the tentacles go out in all directions to the various areas of the arts, but ultimately they are all directed back towards the centre and the administrative section of the centre grows and grows in accordance with the best Parkinsonian principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19750220_reps_29_hor93/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now face the position where members of this Parliament, particularly some in the Opposition in the Senate, who would probably have their seats declared vacant for contravention of the Act, are deciding whether or not they will throw out a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751002_reps_29_hor96/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a tragedy and a disgrace that the fate of a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government should depend on the whim of an individual who is controlled by vested interests including the Press barons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One is the honourable course to follow- to retreat from his incredibly dangerous position and make a clear declaration that he will allow the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Government of Australia to get on with the business of governing free from the threat of Senate obstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1975/19751016_reps_29_hor97/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One important lesson is that <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected governments are the servants of the people and that the  individual is the most important element in a democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760316_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even today the overwhelming majority of Australians who supported or even opposed the Whitlam-led Labor Government are stunned and dumbfounded at the role the people’s House plays in financial matters and at that power being usurped by the undemocratically elected members of the other chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some might say that the members of the other chamber who took on themselves this power to block the supply of finance which is necessary to run the various government departments of this great country were <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected but when one remembers the appointments of  Senator Field  of Queensland and  Senator Bunton  of New South Wales it is hard to understand how anyone could come to that conclusion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1976/19760330_reps_30_hor98/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In what ways are these giant combines to be made accountable and <span class="highlight">democratically</span> responsible to the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>No one could possibly argue that major insurance companies, banks, finance companies and multinational combines operate <span class="highlight">democratically</span> or even that they are subject to the restraints of market forces, as the Prime Minister has suggested. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780228_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australia is one of fewer than 20 countries in the entire world which still have <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected governments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780308_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a phenomenon, moreover, which presents governments of all <span class="highlight">democratically</span> based nations with a continuing, and not easily soluble paradox. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780405_reps_31_hor108/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people of the Northern Territory, in common with other citizens of our federal Commonwealth, have the right- indeed the duty- to control their own affairs through a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected legislature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780511_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that on this side when we mark down the party line <span class="highlight">democratically</span> we all toe it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently its legal advice on this occasion was not quite as sound as that given in 1975 when it succeeded in throwing out a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780525_reps_31_hor109/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Australia has been praised as a country in which, according to the leaders of the governments of Germany and other industrial nations, a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government, with massive majority support at the last election, has been able to invoke an austerity program in the long term interests of this nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19780822_reps_31_hor110/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As members of this Parliament and the Australian populace will remember, the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government was tossed out on 11 November 1975 by the choice of the then Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1978/19781010_reps_31_hor111/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In having a look at them we find, at a rough calculation, that no more than 22 could be called <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected parliaments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790329_REPS_31_HoR113/#debate-30">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This can be achieved, we maintain, by giving real power to a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected local assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790404_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are still people at Aurukun, Mornington Island and all the other State settlements in Queensland who are suffering under the heel of an apartheid-type rule and dictatorship which was imposed on them without consultation with them or their <span class="highlight">democratically</span> chosen leaders or representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790405_reps_31_hor113/#subdebate-30-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But I am concerned that we should ensure that there are adequate safeguards, guidelines, parameters within which that force can operate- parameters that are not to limit it in the discharge of its duties, but parameters that are to limit its capacity, the capacity of any individual member of the force, the capacity of its Commissioner, the capacity of its ministerial head, to abuse the powers in a way which could erode the authority of a <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Parliament and destroy the possibility of that Parliament being <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected again in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He wrote:  lt would in my view be perfectly possible to establish a police system for the whole of Australia, comprising operationally autonomous police forces and a national investigative agency <span class="highlight">democratically</span> controlled in equal partnership, by central and State governments and the police themselves, not a jot less sensitive to the need to preserve civil liberty or the differing requirements of widely separated States but able to achieve uniformity of standards in manpower, training, leadership, specialist services, operational techniques, interchange and improved accountability, all at present unlikely of attainment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790606_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, the parliamentary delegation ought to include Botswana in its tour as it is perhaps the other <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected country in Africa. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Will the Minister assure the House that the recommended legislation is being prepared and that no further dilution, equivocation or delay will be tolerated in awarding control of (a) traditional land, (b) appointment of administrators, (c) the setting of funding priorities and (d) the type, style and structure of community administration to <span class="highlight">democratically</span> chosen representatives of the indigenous community concerned in each case. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790607_reps_31_hor114/#subdebate-35-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Governments have a social responsibility to intervene in order to control <span class="highlight">democratically</span> the direction and pattern of economic development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790830_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of these situations which I have just mentioned- the Weimar, Salisbury and the ASIO responsibility to the CIA- deny the responsibility of the intelligence agency to the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19790918_reps_31_hor115/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A person may be <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected by any trade union, right wing, left wing, centre or whatever it may be, but the Government is giving itself the power over the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, over the judicial review of the deregistration processes which are now in order, to bring about total confrontation with the trade union movement in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791010_reps_31_hor116/#debate-28">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What the Opposition is trying to do is to give to the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Executive general access to the information of ASIO, subject to the limitations about specific individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe it is necessary to make it clear by stating quite clearly the authority of the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Executive to have access to the information provided by ASIO with the specific exceptions listed in the Bill and in our own provision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless that is done, Ministers of the Crown and their colleagues, leading figures either in Government or Opposition, might be subjected to ASIO’s surveillance without the knowledge of any member of the <span class="highlight">democratically</span> elected Executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/hofreps/1979/19791016_reps_31_hor116/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
